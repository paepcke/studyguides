SLR Parsing LR O Parsing Assume stack contains 1 next input ist DFA on input a terminates in state 5 Reduce by X a B if 5 contains item X a B Shift if 5 contains item X 3 tm equivalent to saying 5 has a transition labeled t Mex mm

SLR Parsing Ifthere are conflicts under these rules the grammar is not SLR The rules amount to a heuristic for detecting handles The SLR grammars are those where the heuristics detect exactly the handles

SLR Parsing Lots of grammars SLR including all ambiguous grammars We can parse more grammars by using precedence declarations Instructions for resolving conflicts

SLR Parsing Consider our favorite ambiguous grammar E E E E E lint The DFA for this grammar contains a state with the following items E E E E shift reduce conflict Declaring has higher precedence than resolves this conflict in favor of reducing

SLR Parsing The term is misleading These declarations do not define precedence they define conflict resolutions Not quite the same thing ex Aiken
