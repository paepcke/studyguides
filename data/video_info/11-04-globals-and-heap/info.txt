Globals Heap All references to a global variable point to the same object store a global in an activation record Globals are assigned a fixed address once Variables with fixed address are allocated Depending on the language there may be other statically allocated values

Globals Heap The code area contains object code For most languages fixed size and read only The static area containsxdata not code with fixed addresses e g global data Fixed size may be readable or writable The stack contains an AR for each currently active procedure Each AR usually fixed size contains locals Heap contains all other data In C heap is managed by malloc and free
