Orderings T is the greatest value J is the least All constants are in between and incomparable Let lub be the least upper bound in this ordering Rules 1 4 can be written using lub C s x in lub C p x out p is a predecessor ofs

Orderings Simply saying until nothing changes guarantee that eventually nothing changes The use of lub explains why the algorithm terminates Values start as J and only increase J can change to a constant and a constant to T Thus C s x can change at most twice
