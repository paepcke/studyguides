Conservative Collection Garbage collection relies on being able to find all reachable objects and it needs to find all pointers in an object In C or C it is impossible to identify the contents of objects in memory E g a sequence of two memory words might be A list cell with data and next fields A binary tree node with left and right fields Thus we cannot tell where all the pointers are Alex mm

Conservative Collection But it is Ok to be conservative if a memoryword looks like a pointer it is considered a pointer it must be aligned it must point to a valid address in the data segment all such pointers are followed and we overestimate the set of reachable objects But we still cannot move objects because we cannot update pointers to them what if what we thoughtto be a pointer is actually an account number Alex Aiken
