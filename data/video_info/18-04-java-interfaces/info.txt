u Java programs can use interfaces to ma Java Interfaces e it unnecessary for related classes to share a common abstract superclass or to add methods to Object In other words interfaces play the same role as multiple inheritance in C because classes can implement multiple interfaces class X implements A B C Alex um

Java Interfaces Dispatches e f where e has an interface type are more complex than usual Because methods live at fixed offsets One approach Each class implementing an interface has a lookup table method names a methods Hash method names for faster lookup hashes computed at compile time Alex mm
