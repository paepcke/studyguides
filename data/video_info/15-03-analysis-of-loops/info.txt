Analysis of Loops Consider the statement Y O To compute whether X is constant at this point we need to know whether X is constant at the two predecessors 3 2 X ex Aiken

Analysis of Loops Because of cycles all points must have values at all times Intuitively assigning some initial value allows the analysis to break cycles The initial value J means So far as we know control never Alex um
