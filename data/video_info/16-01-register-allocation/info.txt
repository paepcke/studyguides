Register Allocation Intermediate code uses unlimited temporaries Simplifies code generation and optimization Complicates final translation to assembly Alex mm

Register Allocation The problem Rewrite the intermediate code to use no more temporaries than there are machine registers Method Assign multiple temporaries to each register But without changing the program behavior Alex Amen

Register Allocation Temporaries t1 and t2 can share the same register ifa t my point in the program at most one of t1 or t2 is live Or If t1 and t2 are live at the same time they cannot share a register Max Aim
