1
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:03,285
Ow.

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:06,315
[LAUGH]
>> Where's Corey now?

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,868
Well we've come over to Craig Heller's
lab.

4
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:13,089
Today we're going to be experiencing
physiologic effect of cold on the body and

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:16,617
so Cory has volunteered to try and drop
his body temperature down so

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,141
that we can see what happens in that
process.

7
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,994
We'll have three different measures.

8
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,412
Heart rate will show his response to
shivering.

9
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:27,256
His heart rate should go up go we have his
core temperature measured by

10
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:28,930
the esophageal temperature and

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,562
we'll have the skin temperature measured
by this probe on his hand.

12
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:33,435
Non layers, he's taking off layers.

13
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,711
>> Go Corey.

14
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:36,676
>> Go Corey.

15
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,126
Yes.

16
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:39,634
Alright

17
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,442
>> I was going to say It actually didn't
feel very cold in here, but

18
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,092
I realize that's ridiculous since I'm in
my ski jacket.

19
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:46,846
>> It's pretty cold in here.

20
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,211
>> There it is, skin probes.

21
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,156
>> The rector muscles are hard at work.

22
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:54,568
So you're going to think that I have such
a thick, mad chest hair.

23
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:55,738
>> That'll keep you warm.

24
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,559
>> This is really working.

25
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,844
The blood has pulled out of my fingers and
my toes.

26
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:00,589
White hands.

27
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,192
I'm just starting to shiver a little bit.

28
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:06,584
A couple of minutes ago I was feeling
pretty nervous not really knowing quite

29
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,861
what to expect, what this is going to feel
like.

30
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,617
I don't particularly manage cold well.

31
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:15,091
Has there been any change in my core
temperature?

32
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,829
>> In fact you're going up because you're
shivering.

33
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:21,158
You're 36.7 now so it's still crazy you
know.

34
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:24,698
>> Isn't that partially partially also
because he's vascular constricting

35
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,785
the periphery so he's sending more of the
blood to the core?

36
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:36,977
Amazing compensitory mechanism.

37
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,347
[LAUGH] Fun in the cold room.

38
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:42,408
>> Yeah you can't really tell but I have,
I could feel a little bit of difference.

39
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,798
>> Temperature is still going up.

40
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:46,815
>> Good up, what's the matter with you.

41
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,892
>> You try and mess with this body.

42
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,862
>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] oh, look it just
dropped.

43
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,187
>> Stop talking to us.

44
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,853
>> Well first his heart rate will go up,
and

45
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,769
then heart rate will go down inside, were
not recording that are we?

46
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,719
Ok, so it was in the 80s to start and it's
up to 99 now for his heart, so

47
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,785
he's trying to compensate by increasing
his metabolic rate.

48
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:15,473
And then we'll eventually get to delirium
and unconsciousness and then death.

49
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:17,023
Okay, maybe not that far.

50
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:20,831
[LAUGH] So what's going to happen here is
we're going to accelerate this

51
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:23,149
process since we all have things to do.

52
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:28,269
So we're going to put him in the, in the
water bath because water conducts heat

53
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,310
away from the body 20 times faster than.

54
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,334
>> Whoo.

55
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,332
>> Air.

56
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,345
And so we'll put him in there and it'll
get cold faster.

57
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:41,134
>> Oh man.

58
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:44,342
Now I see some goosebumps.

59
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:53,517
>> [SOUND]

60
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,880
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

61
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,466
>> Back down a little bit.

62
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,769
>> Heart rate's up to 105.

63
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,839
>> Turning up the, current there is a
little bit brutal.

64
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,738
That's mean.

65
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:07,938
Ohh!

66
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,961
>> Going down farther.

67
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:15,221
Oh, nice little tub.

68
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,778
>> The current's the worst.

69
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:21,474
>> Yeah it's a bit challenging.

70
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,013
>> Getting goosebumps?

71
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,419
You're turning a little pale.

72
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,226
Your lips aren't blue yet.

73
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,695
That's good.

74
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,581
How, how you?

75
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,792
>> Starting to feel pretty cold.

76
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,124
>> Yeah.

77
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:35,821
>> But I know my body can last quite a
ways longer.

78
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,455
>> You're not shivering violently yet.

79
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,758
>> Not even close.

80
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:39,840
>> Yeah.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,990
>> But he doesn't have much fat, so he's
very lean and so

82
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,394
there's not a big insulating layer there.

83
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,842
So.

84
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,474
[NOISE] He's been in there for about a
half an hour now, so

85
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,970
he's not able to compensate quite as much
any more.

86
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,811
He's starting to shiver a little bit more.

87
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,727
And we're not going to keep him in too
much longer.

88
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,944
>> Can I catch this ball?

89
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,786
>> [LAUGH]

90
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,714
>> Try to throw it up, yourself, and catch
it.

91
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,836
All right, just like do it like you're
juggling.

92
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,755
Like can you throw it straight up?

93
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:13,379
That's pretty good.

94
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,361
>> It's really not much fine motor going
on here.

95
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,177
>> So, we're trying to see if he's still
has some, or

96
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,292
if he's losing his manual dexterity.

97
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:28,020
So why don't you try and tie my shoe Cory?

98
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,928
Now imagine you're out in the cold trying
to build a shelter.

99
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:34,919
You have to tie that knot.

100
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,732
Okay.

101
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:39,374
So we're going to cut your misery and get
you out of the tank.

102
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,188
>> Ugh.

103
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:43,558
Right here?

104
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,063
>> huh.

105
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:44,860
>> I don't feel anything.

106
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,518
[INAUDIBLE]

107
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:53,316
>> And just hit the one on the left or
the.

108
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,304
>> That's the incline.

109
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:57,507
>> Go about three.

110
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,995
>> Oh wow.

111
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:00,922
>> Now he's got some shaking going on.

112
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,466
>> [INAUDIBLE]

113
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:06,778
>> [LAUGH]
Your legs still function.

114
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:09,828
>> [CROSSTALK] automatically.

115
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:14,676
>> Oh, my gosh.

116
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:17,283
>> There's something that you normally do
with just his type one fibers.

117
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:21,747
So he's doing gross movement patterns and
he feels very uncordinated.

118
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:27,002
Those nerves are just not signalling down
those legs very well.

119
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:30,153
If I focus I can make my entire body stop.

120
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,714
>> Stop jerking?

121
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:34,900
Not entirely!

122
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:43,026
>> It's just like a, work really hard for
a [INAUDIBLE] Isn't that amazing?

123
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,186
>> Amazing, yeah.

124
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:50,093
[INAUDIBLE]
>> So Corey's really hurting now.

125
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,413
I think we've tortured him enough, so

126
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:53,083
we're going to, we're going to take him
out soon.

127
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,149
Let's see if you can catch.

128
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,486
Yeah.

129
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,795
Can you try from one hand to the other?

130
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:06,006
>> Yeah.

131
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:11,999
>> Try to do some of the other tricks you
did earlier.

132
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:19,083
[LAUGH] Let's do a little,

133
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:25,201
one more shoe tie, and

134
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:29,387
then we'll get

135
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:35,881
get you warmed up.

136
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:38,113
Yay!

137
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:38,955
Victory!

138
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,349
[LAUGH] What do you think?

139
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,930
>> You deserve a warm blanket for that.

140
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,140
>> Yeah.
>> Are we done?

141
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,250
>> Yeah, we're done.

142
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,770
Let's get him warmed up.

143
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,480
Temperature down to 34.5.

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,934
[CROSSTALK] You're getting chills and
[INAUDIBLE].

145
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,315
Your hands are real cold.

146
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,290
>> Your hands are just.

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,729
[SOUND]
>> Let's get you out of there.

148
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,140
[BLANK_AUDIO]
