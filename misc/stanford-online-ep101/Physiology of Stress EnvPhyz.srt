1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,460
Where's Corey now?

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,950
Well, Stanford's a very tranquil place,
and so

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,790
we've come to the gates of hell to
introduce our next module.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,120
because our next module is on stress.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,930
And we're just back from a time outside of
Las Vegas in the desert to film our

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,710
stress module.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,230
And we have a little bit of a surprise for

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,110
you in this module because Corey was tired
of being the guinea pig so

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,580
I volunteered to be the subject and he's
going to be the professor.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,200
The thing is when I volunteered for

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,260
this we were going to jump out of the
stratosphere which

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,320
is a 108 story tower attached to this sort
of cable, bungee jump thing.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,810
And that seemed completely doable.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,050
But due to a last minute change in our
plans that we had to make,

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,920
we ended up skydiving.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,530
So, I was in a little over my head, but
the good news is,

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,050
is that everything worked out.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,890
We got great stress data.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,280
And Corey still hasn't stopped laughing
about it.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,620
So, with that introduction, I'm going to
pass over the microphone to Corey,

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,590
Professor Dysek, who is going to take it
from here.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,530
Take it away Corey.

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,780
>> Thank you Doctor.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,650
I'm tired of being the guinea pig.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,940
You're jumping.

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,900
And you're going to be doing it from
15,000 feet out of a plane.

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,980
>> What?
>> So where is the doctor now?

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,340
We currently find ourselves just south of
Las Vegas at Skydive Las Vegas,

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,680
preparing Dr. Friedlander for her 15,000
foot skydive drop.

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,320
The human stress response is the humans'
elegant way of turning

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,450
on all of the systems in the body that are
absolutely crucial for either fighting or

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,490
fleeing and turning off or

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,159
turning down the lower priority body
systems that can wait to use energy later.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,420
As we watch Dr. Friedlander in the next
few moments prepare, we're going to be

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,140
appreciating the look of terror that she's
probably going to have on the outside.

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,035
>> [LAUGH] Just imagine what's inside
right now.

37
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:04,990
>> [LAUGH] While simultaneously measuring
physiologically what's going on,

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,630
on the inside of her body.

39
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,380
Hopefully painting a picture and creating
a story about her inner physiology.

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,860
We're going to be taking a variety of
measurements.

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,890
Her heart rate with a Garmin heart rate
monitor.

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,720
We're going to be using the SenseWear
armband to collect data

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,128
on skin conductance and skin temperature.

44
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,830
And we're going to be collecting blood
specimens to

45
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,630
get information about what's happening to
her stress hormones in the body.

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,780
So beyond gaining an understanding about
what's happening inside of her body,

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,320
we want to be able to better understand
what that means for

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,070
Anne's daily functioning and performance.

49
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,847
So we're going to be doing a series of
performance tests.

50
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:48,502
A cognitive performance test and a pain
test to give us more information about

51
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,979
how stress manifests itself, how stress
impacts her body?

52
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,398
I'm starting to feel nervous, how are you
feeling?

53
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,170
>> I'm very nervous.

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,320
>> The doctor's nervous.

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,905
I'm nervous.

56
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:57,758
Let's see what happens.

57
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:58,693
[NOISE]
>> Let's go do the test!

58
00:02:58,693 --> 00:02:59,837
>> Woo!

59
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:01,734
>> Alright.
Any major surgeries, injuries, pins,

60
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:04,760
plates, screws, rods, neck problems, back
problems, knee problems, anything?

61
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,480
>> No.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,380
>> Not right now.

63
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,540
>> Yeah.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,070
You mean ever in our lives?

65
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,640
>> No.

66
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,320
>> No pins, plates, screws, rods.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,260
>> No, no, no.

68
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,160
Congratulations, and have you been 100%
drug and alcohol free for

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,420
the past eight hours.

70
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,380
>> Yes.

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,583
>> Yes, yes I am.

72
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,280
>> [LAUGH]
>> Wow, that's dry.

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,066
>> What a gift for us to be able

74
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:35,860
to watch Anne stress out.

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,054

Okay.

93
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,350
When you are ready, flip over the page.

>> Cow, Donuts.

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,550
I think I remembered that one.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,310
We did it.

104
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,468
We did the test.

105
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:51,553
We did the jump.
