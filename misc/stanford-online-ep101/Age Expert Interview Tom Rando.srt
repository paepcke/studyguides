1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,500
Evolution wasn't ready for us to age, and

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,240
so we have no intrinsic program to prevent
us from aging.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,990
So I think of it as kind of a systems
failure,

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,050
as things start to fall apart, because
they're not built to last.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,250
>> Does that mean that these people that
are pursuing the fountain of youth,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,440
they're looking for immortality are going
to get there?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,320
Because if it's a disease can you treat
it?

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,160
Can you stop the aging process?

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,540
Doctor Tom Rando is a professor of
Neurology at Stanford where he is

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,300
the director of the Glenn Laboratories For
The Biology Of Aging.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,770
He's also director of the rehabilitation,
research and development center

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,020
of excellence, at the veterans' affairs
Palo Alto health care system.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,170
And the deputy director of the Stanford
Center on Longevity.

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,710
Research in the Rando laboratory focuses
on tissue-specific stem cells in

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,470
aging and disease.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,870
He's the recipient of numerous awards,
including the prestigious NIH director's

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,130
pioneer award for his groundbreaking
research in stem cell biology.

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,070
His work has broad implications for

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,410
the fields of regenetive medicine and stem
cell transplantation.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,930
For those reasons and many more, it is an
honor to be here today with Dr.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,460
Tom Rando with an expert interview in
aging.

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,190
Thank you for taking the time to be with
us Tom.

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,020
>> My pleasure.

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,520
>> So I had to shorten your biography
substantially for the interest of time.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,480
But the bottom line is that you're highly
accomplished.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,120
And you're the director of essentially
everything that related to aging

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,230
in this area, and you have a very
productive lab.

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,050
What inspires you to work so hard in the
field of aging?

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,540
>> Our work in aging really emerged from
our work in actually studying diseases.

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,410
Because, we're, we study in the lab a lot
of muscle degernative diseases,

31
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,990
muscular dystrophies.

32
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,200
And, there are a lot of changes that occur
in those diseases

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,510
that are degenerative and progressive And,
we've always been interested in

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,360
this kind of relationship between these
changes and what happens as we age.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,790
Now, they're, they're not the same,
they're different kinds of changes.

36
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,420
And yet, there are some similarities.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,680
And really what we've been interested in
as we look for treatments for diseases.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,040
Are there actually treatments hidden in
there for the changes that occur in aging.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,170
And muscle, that's really muscle loss.

40
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,390
I mean, there are a lot of biochemical
and,

41
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,130
and morphological changes underlie that.

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,250
It's really, as we know, we lose muscle
when we get older.

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,370
We get weaker as a result.

44
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
That leads to disability.

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,940
People can't get out of the chair, they
can't get out of the bed.

46
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,490
The further disability kind of spirals
downward.

47
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,970
So, we became interested in muscle aging
from that perspective.

48
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,680
And then that's what brodened our
insterest in aging Other tissues and

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,460
people and organisms in a broad sense.

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,320
>> And does that mean that aging is
disease?

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,060
>> That's a great question.

52
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,250
So, I used to always answer that question
no.

53
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,430
I've changed my mind.

54
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,350
I mean, I've changed my mind in the sense
that I wouldn't say aging is disease.

55
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,940
But I have come to the conclusion which I
will now state firmly that it is now

56
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,680
on the spec, its on the spectrum.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,460
And that, and I think a perfect example of
that, for example is bone loss

58
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,190
going from an, a property of aging to
becoming a disease, osteoporosis.

59
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,410
I think muscle loss may soon reach that
same plateau of

60
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,640
being elevated to becoming a disease,
sarcopenia.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,710
As soon as there's a treatment for it, it
will not be called a disease.

62
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,540
And so I've really come to this thinking
that there are these changes that.

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,140
It's almost like a spectrum where you go
from changes that are minor and

64
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,100
relatively insignificant physiologically
like skin wrinkles to changes that

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,490
are truly life threatening.

66
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,600
And I think that if you break it down,

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,210
it's very hard to put a, a firm line
between aging and disease.

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,000
So, I wouldn't say aging is a disease but

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,090
I would just call this a, a broad
spectrum.

70
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,180
>> Does that mean that these people that
are pursuing the fountain of youth and

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,240
looking for immortality are going to get
there?

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Because, if it's a disease, can you treat
it?

73
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,490
Can you stop the aging process?

74
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,020
>> Well, I, I would.

75
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,630
I mean, we study exactly this kind of
question.

76
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,630
And from everything that I know and
everything that I see in,

77
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,500
in across evolutionary time, across
phylogenetic spectra.

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,860
Aging is a fairly, but not completely,
universal property of life.

79
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,260
At least, metazoic life, multicellular
life, and

80
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,690
the idea of stopping aging is almost tenth
my stopping biology.

81
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,690
So I'll leave at that to say I think there
are interventions that

82
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,980
can reduce the burden of age related
disease or age related changes.

83
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,920
And that that will give the appearance of
slowing of aging, but

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,330
nothing we've seen in any organism stops
the aging process.

85
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,540
So I, I think we're stuck with aging.

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,541
>> Hm.
Interesting.

87
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:43,460
So, if we're stuck with aging why, why is
it that we even age at all?

88
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,730
I mean we, we put this huge effort into
creating life and

89
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,080
then, why can't we just maintain it?

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,920
>> Well that's one of the fundamental
evolutionary theory questions,

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,450
is why do we age?

92
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,000
And so the, the, the answer to that is, is
kind of an evolutionary question.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,970
Is, is how is it that over time

94
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,860
as organisms evolved did we not evolve to
become immortal.

95
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,610
And the answer is sort of, it's, it's sort
of a nuance of how organisms I think,

96
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,460
are selected during evolutionary time.

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,570
The fundamental answer is that over
evolutionary time, aging did not exist.

98
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,530
That is, organisms live long enough to
reproduce, and were barely able to

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,790
produce enough adults to produce enough
offspring to propagate the species.

100
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,170
And that's the sort of history of
evolution.

101
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,850
So, aging was an afterthought of
evolution.

102
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,550
And so there was never any, if you want to
consider it sort of

103
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,550
evolutionary investment in the maintenance
of an organism, post reproductive age.

104
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,930
So, whatever happened after that was sort
of fine, but it didn't matter.

105
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,280
It didn't lead to a survival of the
species.

106
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,110
So, I kind of consider aging to be an
experiment of civilization.

107
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
It really is since the civilization, well,

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,530
the development of the evolution of large
mammals.

109
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,330
But, really, if we look at humans,
civilization changed humans from being a,

110
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,390
a species that lived long enough to
reproduce.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,160
To a species that lived long enough to
become old.

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,050
So, we're stuck with an evolutionary
makeup that allows us to grow,

113
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,202
mature, reproduce, and that's it.

114
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:24,680
[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] So I consider it
sort of it's, it's almost an experiment.

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,290
>> It's an artifact.

116
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,490
>> It's an artifact of, of the, the fact
that we can live longer by

117
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,290
building houses and staying warm and
getting, you know, growing food.

118
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,160
And then, much more as we become
civilized, treating diseases.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,530
And so, evolution wasn't ready for us to
age.

120
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,320
So, we have no intrinsic program to
prevent us from aging.

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,930
So I think of it as kind of a systems
failure.

122
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,990
The system is designed to get to a certain
point allow [UNKNOWN] to be produced,

123
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,510
And that's it.

124
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,030
And then however further we go is fine
with evolution, but didn't matter.

125
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,600
And then things start to fall apart
because they're not built to last.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,680
>> That's really interesting.

127
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,250
We could talk philosophy for a long time.

128
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,880
But let's sort of get back to the concrete
work in your lab which is very compelling.

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,995
So tell us what research you're doing in
your lab right now.

130
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,258
Well, where to begin?

131
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:13,970
>> [LAUGH]

132
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,440
>> So, so, I guess the, the research that
we do that's most relevant to

133
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,670
the questions we're talking about today.

134
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,500
Are we study how cells age and in
particular how stem cells age.

135
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,870
And how that relates to how tissues age.

136
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,200
So, pick a tissue.

137
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,510
Skin.

138
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,360
Skin has lots of stem cells its always
producing new skin and

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,480
those are coming from stem cells in the
skin.

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,410
And yet over time skin changes with age.

141
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,420
And our question is, is that because the
stem cells themselves are aging.

142
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,160
Or is it because the cells that producing
the stem cells are in

143
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,970
this environment that makes the tissue
older?

144
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,180
So it's kind of a dichotomy.

145
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,220
But that's the kind of question we ask.

146
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,740
What are the driving mechanisms that make
stem cells produce tissues that are,

147
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,840
in a sense, morphologically older than
young tissues.

148
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,010
And we study this at the level of
genetics.

149
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,690
And we call it epigenetics.

150
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,210
And I think the, the interesting results
that have come from the lab.

151
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,650
Probably the most fundamental issue when
it comes to aging is that the behavior

152
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,630
of an old stem cell can be rejuvenated to
behave like a young stem cell.

153
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,250
And that sounds of course magical,
fountain of youth.

154
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,790
>> Mm-hm.
>> Like you're saying.

155
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,200
And there's some truth to that.

156
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,030
But also there's, yoiu know, it's not that
simple.

157
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,020
But the observations that you can take a
tissue, and we do this mostly in mice.

158
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,130
And by treatments either pharmacologicaly
or

159
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,230
genetically, we can make an old mouse
tissue appear younger in many ways.

160
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,350
Biochemically, histologically, and, and

161
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,139
that seems to be true the more we look
across tissues.

162
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,050
Now the, the challenge is, is there a down
side to that?

163
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,280
And we would argue there probably is, we
haven't really observed it.

164
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,930
But we think that if we're imposing these
conditions that

165
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,140
allow an old stem cell to become young
again.

166
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,420
Or to make young tissue,

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,430
you're also predisposing that cell
Potentially, to producing cancer.

168
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,740
In a way we think of the suppression of
activity that occurs with

169
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,630
age that leads to a diminished activity is
in a way a protective mechanism.

170
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,620
So, you might be able to, and this is how
we think of this therapeutically,

171
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,040
enhance the stem cell activity in the
tissue to repair it.

172
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,780
So you want to repair a skin wound.

173
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,910
We want to repair a bone fracture or a
muscle injury.

174
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,910
You might want to do that better in an old
person.

175
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,270
That would be great if you could, but if
you could do that in a very spatially and

176
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,810
temporally restrictive way.

177
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,500
You could repair that tissue without
imposing, I think,

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,855
this risk of generating a lot of young
stem cells in an old person.

179
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,470
Young stem cells that might proliferate
too much.

180
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,710
And who knows what bad might, might
happen.

181
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,460
These cells probably have acquired a lot
of mutations over a life span.

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,420
So they're probably not the cells you want
proliferating a lot in an old person.

183
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,870
>> Wow, that sounds amazing.

184
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,950
Like, it has huge implications for disease
states and older adults.

185
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,620
But, what about athletes?

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,687
. . .
So athletes, so

187
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,580
older athletes, it might be very relevant.

188
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,230
So, younger athletes, I'm not so sure, in
the sense that we haven't really seen but,

189
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,410
we haven't really tried, to ask.

190
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,320
Can we make a young tissue repair better
but, that's, of course, that would

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,000
be phenomenal for athletes, for people who
are trying to recover from an injury.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,110
But we have seen old tissues repair like
young tissues.

193
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,680
So, we don't know if young tissue repair
is at a maximum.

194
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,210
If it's not, maybe it could be enhanced.

195
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,700
>> Mm-hm.
>> As you suggest.

196
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,310
But what we really looked at is the
spectrum between young tissue repair and

197
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,230
old tissue repair.

198
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,460
And asked can we drive old tissue repair
toward that kind of

199
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,330
younger [UNKNOWN] type.

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
And that's we've been able to do.

201
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,930
And many people have subsequently kind of
done this in other systems and

202
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,610
it seems to be quite a robust phenomenon.

203
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,350
And we do this, if I can just tell you one
experiment.

204
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,130
>> Oh, please.
>> You know,

205
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,420
that kind of highlights the way we can
modify this.

206
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,310
We use a technique called parabiosis in

207
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,770
which two animals are actually joined
surgically.

208
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,810
So they become essentially conjoined
twins.

209
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,360
And, and then they had a single shared
circulatory system.

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,400
So, what's circulating in the blood of one
animal is now circulating in the blood of

211
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,270
the other animal.

212
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,770
And that is done surgically and

213
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,460
it takes a couple of weeks to develop this
true shared circulatory system.

214
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,440
So, what happens if you pair a young
animal with an old animal?

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,770
That was kind of our experimental
question.

216
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,630
And we had reasons to think that there
might be factors in the young animal that

217
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,350
are kind of promoting youthfulness.

218
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,500
And factors in the blood of old animals
that are actually promoting aging, or

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,140
maintaining aging.

220
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,150
And indeed, when we do this parabiosis,
young to old.

221
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,510
We find that in pretty much every tissue
we've looked at, the tissues and

222
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,180
the cells of the old animal adopt a more
youthful phenotype.

223
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:04,120
A more youthful biochemical appearance and
morphologic appearance.

224
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,000
Now, there, there's no free lunch.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,550
The ti, the cells and tissues of the young
animal adopt an older phenotype.

226
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,050
Okay so they seem to be kind of moving
toward the mean.

227
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,060
That's good for the old animal, maybe not
so good for the young animal.

228
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,890
And and so that's, that's really what the,
that's really what is the kind of

229
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,840
fundamental observation, from which we've
gone on to ask How does this work?

230
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Why does this work?

231
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,990
What are the factors?

232
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,410
Not a factor probably.

233
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,540
In fact, we've found some and

234
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,680
other people have found many contributing
to different tissues.

235
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,210
So you have many different factors Blood's
[?] a complicated tissue.

236
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,890
>> So I'm an exercise physiologist so I
have to ask.

237
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,410
What does physical activity and

238
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,825
exercise do to these factors that you've
identified?

239
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:45,780
Uh-huh.

240
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,170
So, we just started to actually ask this
question.

241
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:54,370
So, we actually have a new NIH Grant
called The Transformative [UNKNOWN].

242
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,700
Because it's kind of a little bit of a
wild idea.

243
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,980
But, but we have the hypothesis that.

244
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,070
So, one thing is known, which you know
well,

245
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,510
is that exercise is kind of good for
everything.

246
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,590
It's good for everything.

247
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,100
Almost every parameter you look at
physiologically exercise improves that.

248
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,330
And one of the things we've been very
interested in is that exercise improves

249
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,360
neurogenesis.

250
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,800
So new neuron formation in the brain.

251
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,280
As well as improves cognitive function.

252
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,860
So this is in collaboration with a Tony
[INAUDIBLE] Stanford.

253
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,520
We have the hypothesis that exercise
actually leads to the production of

254
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,110
factors in muscle that are secreted into
the blood.

255
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,960
That travel around the body and that are,
is good for what ails you.

256
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,900
So, and these are, this is a field,

257
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,330
well the field of these kind of secretory
factors is called myokines.

258
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,610
And that's kind of In in opposition to a
dipicons.

259
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,340
Factors secreted from fat that are very
pro flammatory and not very good for you.

260
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,440
So we think there might be this balance
between midicons and

261
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,790
dipicons generally as we get older.

262
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,870
And midicons might be enchaned by
exercise.

263
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,190
So that's kind of our current working
hypothesis.

264
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,290
We had a lot of mice Running on treadmills
and actually, we have some studies for

265
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,340
people to, for [UNKNOWN] humans to look at
myokinds in the blood.

266
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,595
Ask if they are secreted.

267
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:19,190
because myokinds don't all have to come
from muscles,

268
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,620
they can also come from other tissues.

269
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,440
But as, actually,

270
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,415
exercise induces the expressions of these
pro-longevity, if you will.

271
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:31,870
Pro-health factors from muscle, that are
secreted into the blood, and

272
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,190
that can have wide ranging physiologic
effects.

273
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,160
>> And are these the usual suspects, like
the growth factors, IGF 1,

274
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
BDNF those types of things?

275
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
>> That's what, we're looking at those for

276
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,090
sure and then we're looking for novel
molecules that aren't yet identified.

277
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,180
Those are obviously high on our list as
candidates and and the we're testing them.

278
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,250
And so one of our long term experiences as
we

279
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,560
began to see what changes as we exercise.

280
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,530
What goes on in the blood.

281
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,080
What comes from muscle.

282
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,840
And then ask what if we knock out that
gene,

283
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,860
we block that gene only in muscle, could
we block the effects of exercise?

284
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,718
I mean that would essentially prove the
hypothesis that exercise,

285
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,000
through its' effects on muscle,

286
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,760
physiology, leads to improved physiology
elsewhere, through secreted factors.

287
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,410
>> So, you're an athlete yourself.

288
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,820
You're a marathon runner, and you're doing
work in aging and exercise.

289
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,170
And so how has all this information that
you've gathered impacted your

290
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,110
ideas on training and competition and
Motivation.

291
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,260
>> So, yeah, I think about these things
all the time.

292
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,130
Because a lot of what, when I'm training,
obviously I'm always dealing with

293
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,460
sore muscles and injuries and that sort of
thing.

294
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,660
And it's all about repair, you know, at
that point.

295
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,520
And I would say practically the research
that we do in

296
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,130
the lab hasn't translated in a new
training program.

297
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,665
>> No magic training programs to share?

298
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:54,320
[CROSSTALK]
>> I don't have anything

299
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,680
unfortunate no stem cells in the freezer
that I checked in when I get home,

300
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,580
which I would love to do.

301
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,040
But but it, but it, but it's just, it,

302
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,120
it, I think it informs my thinking about
my own physiology, and,

303
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,410
and in fact, if anything I would say I
spend more time resting than training.

304
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,990
As a result as a, really thinking that you
know,

305
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,170
that time is important for the training
process and recovery.

306
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,360
I mean, this is what trainers will tell
you to do, but most people ignore it and

307
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,210
they think, I'm going to go out and run
anyway and then I'm sore.

308
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,660
But, I think I listen more to my body.

309
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,210
Thinking about what's happening.

310
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,040
>> That's because you have pictures in
your brain that was actually going

311
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,190
on a little micro [CROSSTALK].

312
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:43,210
>> But I would that's probably the aspect
of the work.

313
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,560
That if anything kind of changes my
training its the notion of recovery and

314
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,620
the importance of recovery in training.

315
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,480
again, that's not, you know, that's well
known but I think it,

316
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
it kind of it resonates when I think about
the work we do.

317
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,950
>> > And does that apply to young people
and older people?

318
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,280
>> > I think so and I think young people
recover faster but absolutely.

319
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,150
I think it applies to younger people and
the, the interesting thing is

320
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,290
when we first published these results, And
it was, we, we found these improvements

321
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,740
of repair in old animals, in these
parabiotic pairs, looking at muscle.

322
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,340
But we looked at other tissues.

323
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,480
We looked at liver, we looked at brain, we
looked at skin, we looked at blood.

324
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,220
But we focused on muscle because that's
what my lab mostly focuses on.

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,580
Yeah there was a lot interest in, in this.

326
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,510
And, I have to say there was a lot of
interest from the academic community.

327
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,415
But, the main interest in terms of the
number of phone calls and

328
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:42,120
e-mails I received after I first published
this.

329
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,640
These findings on how to improve muscle
repair were from men's health magazines.

330
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,147
>> [LAUGH]

331
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:50,080
>> That was by far and away kind of the
greatest, you know, what have you got?

332
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,710
What are you hiding?

333
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,640
What are you not telling us?

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,520
And, you know, they're looking for the,
the factors of the drugs.

335
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,840
And indeed, you know, I think there's a, a
good likelihood that, that these can be,

336
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,310
and they are being developed into
therapeutics.

337
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,810
But that I would, I would just come back
to something you said before.

338
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,580
For me, this therapeutics for repair.

339
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,370
It's not therapeutics for becoming
younger.

340
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,680
You know, the, the, I don't think there's
going to be any easy road to slow or

341
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,710
stop kind of tissue aging.

342
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,830
But I'd really like to think that there
will be therapeutics developed to help

343
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,020
repair injuries in older people for enough
time when they weigh.

344
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,210
Bu, help them recover function more
quickly.

345
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,600
>> Yeah, or other people, I'm sure other
people are working on,

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,570
taking the very factors right now, had GNC
contacted you?

347
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,800
And,
>> They have not,

348
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,530
I mean cause most of the, most that
factors that we and

349
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,420
others have found are proteins.

350
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,990
So those are you know, not easy to
administer.

351
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,190
Not easy to get from you know, a bottle
into your system.

352
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,400
And so small molecules are the key.

353
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,590
And, and we and others are looking at
that.

354
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,110
If these proteins that we identify, that,
you know, that increase with age,

355
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,860
maybe you want to suppress.

356
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,360
Because maybe they're promoting aging.

357
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,550
Or they decrease with age, and you want to
increase them.

358
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,340
If instead of modifying those proteins.

359
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,150
If we could use small molecules that could
do the same thing, and

360
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,800
that's a pill you could take.

361
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,820
So we haven't gotten there yet.

362
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,110
So, we haven't, you know,

363
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,510
so no one's contacted me about licensing
the the compounds.

364
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,960
But people have certainly been interested
in licensing the concepts, and

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,800
then it's trying to find the small
molecules.

366
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,400
So what else is going on in the field that
you're just keeping an eye on.

367
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,150
So not just in your lab but like the,

368
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,170
a major finding in the last couple years
that you're very excited about.

369
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,350
>> In, in aging?

370
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,850
>> In aging.

371
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,940
>> hm, good question.

372
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,710
You know, there's so many aspects of aging
that are still really unknown.

373
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,290
And, I think I, I would say there's not a,

374
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,960
I guess the area that I'm most interested
in.

375
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,380
Or the area that I think is ripe for
changing the way we

376
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,340
think about aging is this I used the word
previously, epigenetics.

377
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,080
Now, epigenetics is a, kind of of a vague
word, because it kind of.

378
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,070
You can use it mean almost anything other
than the gene sequence.

379
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,370
So it loses meaning in some ways.

380
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:17,320
Having said that I think and, and this is
kind of the area we work in.

381
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,000
If you look at old tissues and you ask why
they're old, or an old cell,

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,740
the one of our holy grails is to be able
to take a cell and say how old is it.

383
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,840
You know, someone give you a cell, we
don't know where it comes from.

384
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,380
Can we tell how old that, or really, how
old the person, or

385
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,660
the mouse, from which that cell came.

386
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,120
How old was that?

387
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,825
And we think that's going to be possible.

388
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:40,010
>> So not chronologically, but
functionally, essentially.

389
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,250
because everybody, just as you.

390
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,210
>> Well, let's say, let's, let's come
back.

391
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,470
Let's say chronologically.

392
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,010
Is this from a one year old mouse or a two
year old mouse.

393
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,240
And there's no two year-old mouse in the
same strain,

394
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,010
that looks like a, however differently
they age.

395
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,150
And there's no 90 year old that,

396
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,630
that is like a 40 year old, in the absence
of disease, right.

397
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,660
So, so, you're right that there's going to
be a variation one 40 year old to another,

398
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,390
one 90 year old.

399
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,630
But, if you really talk about across the
lifespan, there's no, you know,

400
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,660
pathologists who couldn't tell you a 90
year old liver from a 40 year

401
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,190
old liver in otherwise healthy people.

402
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,550
So if you take a cell, you can see that
under the microscope,

403
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,460
you can clearly tell, you take one cell.

404
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,900
And you ask what is it about that cell
that makes it old?

405
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,540
Is there a, you know, is there a clock in
there somehow or something like that?

406
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,780
Is there some marker that tells you how
old that cell is?

407
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,650
So we are looking at this,

408
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,850
and we're hypothesizing that there will be
an epigenetic signature.

409
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,200
That is when we know what to measure,
which is what we're looking to find out.

410
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,140
We will be able to tell you out how old
that cell is, or

411
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,300
that how old the person from whom that
cell came is.

412
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,780
So what we're really interested in is what
aging means.

413
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,040
To a cell.

414
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,550
And we think that will be at the level for
what we call this epi-genetic signature.

415
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,520
And that's, that has to do with
modifications of DNA.

416
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,940
Proteins that bind to DNA that change with
age.

417
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,190
And there are many other ways to think
epi-genetics.

418
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,140
But we try and reduce it to things that we
can measure and

419
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,420
characterize and look for this kind of
epi-genetic signature of aging.

420
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,810
Is that how the influence, the environment
is influencing the genome?

421
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,490
Is through these genetics and changes?

422
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,050
>> That's exactly what we hypothesized,
and we have evidence that that's true.

423
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,420
So if you look at these epigenetic
patterns,

424
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,040
let's say, the way proteins bind to DNA.

425
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,840
A lot of these proteins that bind to DNA
and

426
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,900
warp DNA in this structure called
chromatin.

427
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,180
And if you look at old cells they have
very different chromatic patterns

428
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,490
than young cells.

429
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,300
And if we rejuvenate the cells by these
parabodic experiments or

430
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,020
other ways, now are we to do this.

431
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,460
As in do they then adopt the young
epigenetic profile?

432
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,860
And that's exactly what we're looking for
and I feel confident that's going to be

433
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,000
True and I will then be entered to see how
much, if its true,

434
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that actually is kind of causal of what's
happening in epigenetics.

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,940
So right now its at a correlation but

436
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,210
if we can drive that epigenetic process
directly.

437
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,530
Can we rejuvenate cells by changing those
epigenetic states rather than by,

438
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,480
you know, connecting them to other
animals.

439
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,190
But as for humans [LAUGH] we're not
actually proposing that we will

440
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,350
rejuvenate humans or rejuvenate tissues
from humans that way.

441
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,048
So we're looking for these kind of more
biochemically tractable and

442
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:29,240
definable parameters that might define.

443
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,590
It really comes down to definig what is
aging?

444
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,040
For a cell, what is aging?

445
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,560
It is the passage of time, but it's a,

446
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,340
it's a fairly predictable, reproducible
series of changes in the cell.

447
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,220
And, can we begin to understand what that
is, and, and

448
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,030
why these apparent rejuvenation processes
are reversing, apparently reversing aging?

449
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,050
>> Yeah, it's amazing,.

450
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,710
As someone who is getting somewhat older

451
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,010
to experiencing these changes that you
read about.

452
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,520
And you research and then you think it'll
never happen to you.

453
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,710
And then [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]
>> I know.

454
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,909
The, the immortality of youth.

455
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:03,690
[LAUGH]
>> It's amazing.

456
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,810
>> Quickly disappears.

457
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,590
>> Well, what you're talking about is so
interesting that I could go on and

458
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,890
on but we should probably think about
wrapping up.

459
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,870
So towards the end here.

460
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,130
What advice would you give to students who
are watching who might want to

461
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,060
go into the field of aging research?

462
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,530
>> That's a great question, and

463
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,810
I think, I get that all, because I get
students who come in.

464
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,090
Actually, I get a lot of people, students
and post-docs who come from

465
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,910
other fields because they, they come to my
lab because they want to work on aging.

466
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,810
And I kind of read these papers and it's
all very intriguing.

467
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,500
And they, but they have usually fairly
ill-formed concepts of what they

468
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,440
really want to study.

469
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,520
They want to study aging and of course
that becomes far too broad to study.

470
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,230
So my, my advice would be to, to focus on
a,

471
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,970
a, what I've called a tractable question.

472
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,260
Don't, don't go out to seek, don't seek a
way of stopping the aging process.

473
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,640
Look at what you can do and find a kind of
mechanism and

474
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,420
a system in which you can study this.

475
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,980
Something that really can be studied to
understand kind of a cause and

476
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,770
effect relationship.

477
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,080
Because the, the history of aging research
has been so largely correlative.

478
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,460
You know, you take a young animal home and
see what's different between them.

479
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,510
And, but really the question is what are
the driving mechanisms?

480
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,450
And I think in these rejuvenation
experiments, we have, you know, finally

481
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,720
a kind of experimental intervention that
allows us to do more than correlate.

482
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,250
So, so I think that's the real challenge
in aging research,

483
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:33,720
is finding Aspects that are that are truly
mechanistic.

484
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,850
And, and they can really tell us why cells
age and, and are there ways that,

485
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,050
when we delay it or slow it, that we can
understand the mechanism.

486
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,550
The other thing I guess I would, I would
advise, and

487
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,640
this maybe a little bit off of what people
would want to study is.

488
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,760
I would say become very firmly entrenched
in evolutionary theory.

489
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,120
Because evolution theory has absolutely
changed the way I

490
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,990
think about aging completely.

491
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,194
And you know there's a, there's a famous
evolutionist theorist

492
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:10,180
Dobzhansky who said nothing makes sense
except in the light of, in Biology.

493
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,015
Nothing makes sense except in the light of
evolution.

494
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:17,120
And I think nothing could be more true
than in aging that if you

495
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,580
think about how and why we age and you
don't look at evolutionary history.

496
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,120
You'll get the wrong idea, and I'll just
use one example.

497
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,890
There had been a theory of aging for many,
many decades and

498
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,630
people still think this is true.

499
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,810
That we age so that old people die, on
purpose, you know for

500
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,500
some evolutionary plan to get rid of them,
so there's more food for young people.

501
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,390
And this comes back to what we were
talking about at the beginning,

502
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,180
it's That can't be true.

503
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,820
Because over evolutionary time there were
no old people.

504
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,290
So, so even though it kind of makes some
sense when you have a society and

505
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,290
limited resources, that's a very, very
modern phenomenon.

506
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,240
So I think it's very, very important to
couch the questions in terms of

507
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,450
the evolutionary theory of how and why we
age.

508
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,610
>> That's creative huh [LAUGH]?

509
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,580
And do you have any last take home message
that you want to share on life,

510
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,780
on research, on whatever?

511
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,930
>> Well, so I guess you know,

512
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,870
one of the things that comes up all the
time when we talk about aging is

513
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,680
is really this investment in aging
research.

514
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,219
That the NIH is making, and foundations
are making, and Google is now in the game.

515
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,130
Whats the goal?

516
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:31,840
And I think that if I have a thought to
share its that we for sure and many people

517
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,480
like most the people I know who study
aging, are not looking to extend lifespan.

518
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,990
I know that's what we all want and in some
sense we all want to extend lifespan, but

519
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,360
of course we all want to extend lifespan.

520
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,240
Healthy and young.

521
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
Young.

522
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,710
so, really what the focus of aging
research really is,

523
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,860
is health span extension.

524
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,050
How do we, as we age, maintain our health,
maintain our physical function,

525
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,850
our mental function, and and reach old age
as healthy as possible.

526
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,210
So, I think in the public press and you
know, in popular.

527
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,056
>> In the websites online.

528
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:08,570
[CROSSTALK]
>> It's all about living, you know,

529
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,170
living to 150 and that's all well and good
in terms of thinking about.

530
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,340
But that's not what the research is about.

531
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,490
It will for sure increase the number of
people who are living to very,

532
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,300
very old age.

533
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,330
You know, centenarians and super
centenarians past 110.

534
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,870
But really, the focus of the research in
most labs is,

535
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,630
is really ultimately directed to healthy
aging.

536
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,780
And, and so I think, you know, we think of
that, in that sort of therapeutic way.

537
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,090
Of what are we doing that can really help,

538
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,680
with the kinds of changes that occur with
age and diseases that occur with age.

539
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,920
>> Well, thank you so much for talking
with us.

540
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,640
And thank you for all the great work that
you're doing.

541
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,370
It's helping us all.

542
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,933
>> My pleasure, I hope that it can help me
too.

543
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:48,433
Great.
