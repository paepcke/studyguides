00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,804
We have arrived at the last module for
this section on heat.

00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,612

or are you talking to Zack?

>> So you're going to be there once a day
[INAUDIBLE]

18
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,817
>> Actually, you know,

19
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,170
we should be writing stuff like this down.

20
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,423
All right, last one of this.

21
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,663
>> You can do whatever you like.

22
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,040
>> Now am I too low energy now?

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,147
Am I too mellow?

24
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:52,933
>> No, I think that's great.

25
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,524
>> Alright, alright.

You can, you've already got to see Corey
get hot.

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,404
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:02,440
Can I start that over, is that actually
proper English?

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,074
You've already [SOUND] got to see.

30
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:08,272
You already got, okay.

00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:10,115
Not you've already [INAUDIBLE].

Welcome back to Module 5 - Minimizing the
Negatives.

33
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:21,943
We just spent a couple of modules talking
about hot, ho, ho, huh [SOUND] [LAUGH].

34
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:27,131
>> [LAUGH]
>> Was that enough of a step [LAUGH].

35
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,186
>> That was awesome.

36
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:29,573
I was like yeah!

37
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,609

41
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,382
>> It's pretty good.

00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,904
[LAUGH] Now I'm not going to be able to do
it without laughing.

45
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,883
[NOISE] I notice that I stepped.

Before we move on to Module 6.

49
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:03,689
I'd like to say a couple words about drugs
and hyperthermia.

50
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,664
Disturbances in dopamine and

51
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:10,394
serotonin in the brain have been inclemen,
implecate, have [LAUGH].

52
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:11,440
>> Implemicious.

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,135
>> Implemented, implicated [LAUGH] have
been [SOUND].

54
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:22,222
Hey, hey, [NOISE] wake up out there!

55
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:22,960
This is important.
