1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,700
Welcome back to the physiology of stress.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,590
It's time to explore stress and the immune
system.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,390
We've come a long way and

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:16,290
arrived at the last major system, through
which we will examine stress response.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,750
The immune system is tasked with the
responsibility of

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,100
protecting your body from external
invaders.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,880
And patching you up when things go wrong.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,360
It's so important for survival that it
makes sense it should be included in

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,650
the conversation about how your body
responds during high stakes situations.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,240
Our journey will including gaining and
understanding of the good, the bad and

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,910
the ugly of how stress impacts our immune
system.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,070
We will then transition into the dangers
of chronic stress.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,200
And just when you think there is no hope,

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,730
we will present a model based in science
that will give us this secret to stress.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,450
But before we do, let's take a quick look
and

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,200
do a little quick and dirty on the nuts
and

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,050
bolts of the immune system as is relevant
to understanding the stress response.

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,540
Your immune system, as we said, is tasked
with protecting the cells of your body.

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,505
Stanford professor Firdaus Dhabhar has
helped us understand the role of

20
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,430
the immune system during stress.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,990
He describes the immune system as the
military to your body's castle.

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,780
And it has specialized soldiers with
different skills that go into battle.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,820
When the stress response is activated, our
good old friend, the sympathetic chain,

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,850
has fibers that extend into the bone
marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,200
These different storage sites serve as
the, the barracks, the,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,860
the storage sites for the military
soldiers, the immune cells.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,380
And sympathetic innervation is the siren
that mobilizes them to

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,220
action in the blood stream.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,960
To enter into the boulevards of the body.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,850
Then, presence of glucocortitoids, you
remember cortisol, from HPA activation,

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,420
alerts the soldiers to take their battle
stations, at the skin.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,090
Acute, or a short term stress, in healthy
individuals,

33
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,670
seems to activate the immune system
placing soldiers at their battle stations.

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,310
It makes sense that we have been created
in this way, because you can

35
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,870
imagine that at a time that you are
attacked, let's say you're bitten or

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,910
whatever, it would be a good time for your
immune response to be on

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,390
alert to respond appropriately to combat
intruders and risk of infection.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,290
It might surprise you to see the word
stress and good and

39
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,250
immune system, all in the same place.

40
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,860
The media has certainly done a great job
of making a villain out of stress.

41
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,360
And mostly, it's for good reason, which
we'll get to shortly.

42
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,600
But you came here, to get a more nuanced,
scientific understanding.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,490
And the truth is, is that stress,

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,410
in the right context, can be quite good
for your immune response.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,010
Just like acute stress recruits the heart,
hormones and nervous system to

46
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,470
help you confront a stressor, the stress
response also recruits the immune

47
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,160
system to help you survive challenges like
wounding and infection.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,110
That are associated with a recent attacker
stressor.

49
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,310
Professor Dhabhar was crucial in helping
us arrive at this understanding.

50
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,380
That stress, can be good for us.

51
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,420
An excellent academic and even better
person, you will have the opportunity to

52
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,860
meet him for an expert interview at the
end of this section.

53
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,625
And formed by many years of research on
this question,

54
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,812
Dhabhar proposes that stress can either be
immuno-enhancing or

55
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:55,540
immuno-suppressing, based on a handful of
critical factors.

56
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,610
The basic summary is, is that when
psychological stress lasts longer

57
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,360
than a short bout and becomes chronic,
everything changes.

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,100
Almost all functional markers of immune
fuction are compromised.

59
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,810
You experience something called, global
immunosuppression.

60
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,960
All types, and all phases of the immune
response are negatively affected.

61
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,020
Leaving your body susceptible to illness.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,610
People experiencing big life stressors are
more likely to get colds and,

63
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,360
if the chronic stress persists,

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,270
are increasingly susceptible to other more
serious infectious disease.

65
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,930
Each of these systems that we've discussed
are optimized during

66
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,720
the stress response to promote survival.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,500
They have been designed for acute, for
short term stressers.

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,300
To help us animals either overcome a
challenge or die trying.

69
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,990
However, it seems that this system has
started to

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,530
go a little bit wonky on us in our most
recent human social environments.

71
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,850
Evolutionary stressors, like the stress
response was designed for,

72
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,810
like running away from a bear, are no
longer as relevant in our

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,810
day to day lives for many of us in the
modern world.

74
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,640
Instead, psychologial stressors seem to
have replaced physiological stressors,

75
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,460
as the primary activator of the stress
response.

76
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,310
As famed researcher Hans Selye discovered
during the infancy of

77
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,890
stress response discovery, chronic stress
is bad news bears.

78
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,580
He found that persistent activation of the
stress response led to

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,140
the atrophy of immune organs, enlargement
of the agren, adrenal gland.

80
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,110
And the development of peptic ulcers.

81
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,140
What he found was that while the stress
response can mobilize resources

82
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,250
necessary for survival in the short term,
if continuously activated,

83
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,140
the stress response itself, the stress
response itself becomes harmful.

84
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:09,445
In fact, it is estimated by Herbert Benson
at the Harvard Medical School, that 60 to

85
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:14,840
90% of visits to primary care doctors are
as a result of stress-related diseases.

86
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,310
Each of these systems, during acute
stress, optimize the body, to perform.

87
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,910
To make us, [SOUND] version, 2.0 of
ourselves.

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,520
But our bodies weren't created to maintain
high levels of stress.

89
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,430
And these same systems that are so good
for

90
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,860
us in short bouts, start creating some
real serious problems.

91
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,810
Increased cardiovascular tone helps in the
short term.

92
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,680
But creates peripheral resistance and
contributes to the development of

93
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,940
cardiovascular disease and cerebra,
cerebra vascular disease in the long term.

94
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,715
Prolonged elevated levels of Cortisol
leads the redistribution of fat stores and

95
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:01,820
disrupts metabolic processes leading to
weight gain and obesity.

96
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,600
Elevated cortisol levels facilitate nerve
cell death, affect memory and

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,410
cognitive ability.

98
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,420
Chronic suppression of the immune system
impairs normal wound healing and

99
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,753
puts the individual at greater risk of
infectious disease.

100
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:23,970
Unfortunately, Type 2 bi-, diabetes, being
fat, having a heart attack or

101
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,550
a stroke, digestion problems, and
infectious disease, and cell death, they

102
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,420
all contribute towards creating a greater
load on an already weakened immune system.

103
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,260
You can see how the slippery slope becomes
a downward spiral when it

104
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,190
comes to stress and the immune system.

105
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,730
So why should you care?

106
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,512
Well, you should care because chronic
stress contributes to having all sorts of

107
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,800
problems that none of us want to have.

108
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,690
Like an increased risk of adult onset
diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease,

109
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,270
which means heart attack, cerebral
vascular disease which means stroke.

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,680
Malabsorption disorders, which means
stomach problems,

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,340
infertility, immune depression, risk of
infectious disease, nerve cell death,

112
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,430
reduced memory and cognitive function, as
well as many other things.

113
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,100
As best said by famous Stanford Professor,

114
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,130
Robert Sapolsky, who's a leading expert on
chronic stress.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,950
Stress related diseases emerge
predominantly out of the fact that we so

116
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,620
often activate a physiological system that
has evolved for

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,340
responding to acute physical emergencies.

118
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,310
But we turn it on for

119
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,340
months on end, worrying about mortgages,
relationships, and promotions.

120
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,830
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,880
So what is the moral of the story?

122
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,750
How can we take this information to
transform the way that we live our lives?

123
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,740
We have covered so much information on how
the stress response works and

124
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,590
I am really proud of you for making it
this far.

125
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,200
You now have a depth of understanding that
allows for

126
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,210
us to, to synth-, synthesize and simplify
the science to make our lives better.

127
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,470
So with all this information, we know
enough to create

128
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,460
a science based model about the most
optimal relationship to have with stress.

129
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,370
Among the four systems of the body we
discussed,

130
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,840
a handful of things emerged around the
stress response.

131
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,110
The first thing is that the acute stress
response is highly adaptive and

132
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,180
it is your best friend.

133
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,150
You now know way too much to be fooled by
the oversimplified conversations around

134
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,730
you about stress always being bad.

135
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,400
Hogwash.

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,180
Stress is so helpful in recruiting the
resources we need,

137
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,220
to overcome the obstacles in our daily
life.

138
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,526
The stress response makes us better, and
our lives richer and more exciting.

139
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:04,920
The second theme, that you're perhaps a
little more familiar with already,

140
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,830
is that chronic stress is bad.

141
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,170
Your body optimizes stress systems to
promote performance in the short term,

142
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,270
but if activated in the long term it can
cause serious problems.

143
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,860
So, beside me is a model of how must of us
live our lives in relationship to stress.

144
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,780
We spend a lot of our time in the triangle
area on your left.

145
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,360
Stressed out, but with an itty-bitty
little triangle peak that isn't very high,

146
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,940
meaning, we aren't being very productive
with stress when we are stressed.

147
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,050
We spend very little time in the recovery
state,

148
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,420
mostly because we haven't been taught the
strategies we need to feel better and

149
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,550
to transition from a state of stress to
recovery.

150
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,670
And as a result, we spend a lot of time in
the evil,

151
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,269
chronic stress box, exposing ourselves to
the horrors we know come as a result.

152
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,920
Fortunately, science offers a better
model.

153
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,230
It tells us that we should increase the
intensity of the stress

154
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,860
response at the right times.

155
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,340
Many of us fight stress when we actually
need it the most.

156
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,120
And could actually benefit from more
targeted and

157
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,850
perhaps more intense stress responses.

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,540
Having the ability to get yourself
stressed in the right way

159
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,380
at the right time is crucial for success.

160
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,160
However, when the intense and

161
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,060
specific stress response has accomplished
its goal, it's over.

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,170
Developing the skill to transition from a
state of stress to a state of recovery is

163
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,630
crucial, extending the period of time we
spend in the recovery state.

164
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,340
As a result, we minimize exposure to
chronic stress, and

165
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,409
we put our mind and our body on an upward
spiral towards living a better life.

166
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,210
Now that we have such a deep understanding
of the stress response, and a model for

167
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,830
how it can be most adaptively supportive
to our lives,

168
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,940
it's time to orient ourselves towards the
parasympathetic nervous system.

169
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,940
The secret to stress.

170
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,920
And gain the tools that we need to apply
the science of stress to our own lives.

171
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,090
See you soon, thanks.
