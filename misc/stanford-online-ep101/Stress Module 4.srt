00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,510
Welcome back to the Physiology of Stress.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,193
Today, stress gets nervous.

3
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:07,726
And we explore the ins and

4
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:12,240
the outs of how the nervous system is
involved with the stress response.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,180
Previously, we addressed how the
cardiovascular system is activated when

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,780
we get stressed.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,100
We're now going to move on to our major
system.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,140
And discuss the role of the brain, and the
nervous system.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,100
First, we'll talk about the brain, some of
its components.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,980
And how to initiate our stress response.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,490
Second, we'll talk about how our memory
and

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,760
mental performance is impacted by stress.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,370
If you recall from the story video, Anne
performed worse on

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,560
the cognitive performance test after
jumping out of the plane.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,380
And we're going to talk about why that
happened.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,300
Third and lastly,

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,520
I will leave you with some awesome tools
from the Rotman Research Institute.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,848
That might just help you make sense out of
why you seem to make so

19
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,079
many poor decisions.

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,590
Particularly with people that you care
about, when you're stressed.

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,090
So, how does a stress response get
activated in our bodies?

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,850
I like to think of the brain as the
kingpin system of the stress response.

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,610
It plays the crucial role of interpreting
something as stressful.

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,529
And activating the various systems to be
able to respond appropriately.

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,770
So what does physiology tell us about how
stress is initiated by the brain?

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,380
How do scientists think that the brain is
able to activate the stress response?

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,902
Well, let's take a deep dive into the
brain to familiarize ourselves with some

28
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:39,910
of the main players.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,760
As we come around the brain, we can see
the cortex and the mid brain.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,860
With the brain stem left out of the model
to help give us a better look.

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,000
As we come around the corner, we're
going to see each of

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,460
these brain components highlighted in
different colors.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,850
The hippocampus is in yellow.

34
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,530
And it's known to be important for the
formation of memories.

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,024
The Hypothalamus, which you remember from
HPA axis, sits on top of the brain stem.

36
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:09,390
And is featured here in purple,

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,200
with connections to the pituitary shown in
blue.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,540
It has a number of nuclei and

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,060
various responsibilities, but it's a major
player in the stress response.

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,590
With projections that activate the
sympathetic branch.

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,960
And, connecting the nervous system with
the endocrine system through the HPA axis.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,160
The amygdala, shown in red, is commonly
the,

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,220
the go-to brain region that people love to
talk about when talking about stress.

44
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,590
Its role is often described as assigning
significance to a stimulus.

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,800
It rapidly identifies whether we should be
stressed out by something or not.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,790
The amygdala is well connected to the
hippocampus and to the hypothalamus.

47
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,670
Making it well situated for access to
memory information.

48
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,900
And to activate the hypothalamus to
initiate the stress response if need be.

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,233
The prefrontal cortex, here in orange, is
responsible for a lot of different things,

50
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,660
and we're not going to talk about.

51
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,660
It's accociated with things like
personality, decision making, and

52
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,990
moderating all sorts of behavior.

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,720
It's also believed to regulate stress and
emotional activity.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,790
Turning down the activation of lower level
brain regions like the amygdala.

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,220
It's thought to be, the muscle of sorts,

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,680
that is trained in cognitive behavioral
therapy, for example.

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,290
A setting where patients are taught
strategies to better manage and

58
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,420
influence their emotional responses.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,540
These regions work in concert with one
another to identify that

60
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,370
stressful simul, stimulus.

61
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,200
And send a signal to get your body into
action.

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,590
So once these brain regions identify the
external stressor,

63
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,890
that information is passed on to the
hypothalamus.

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,630
Our one stop shop for activating the
bodies stress response.

65
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,190
As you can see from this great graphic,

66
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,700
the hypothalamus can initiate both the HPA
axis and the sympathetic chain.

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,600
We will go into greater detail of the HPA
in our next lecture.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,030
For now, we're going to focus on my right
side.

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,009
My right side of this graph.

70
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,000
The hypothalamus has nerve path ways that
project it downwards into the spine, and

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,820
create what's called the sympathetic
chain.

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,220
The sympathetic chain is this really cool,

73
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,320
series of ladder like nerve projections,
from the thoracic and lumber spine.

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,469
If you were looking straight down into an
open chest wall.

75
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,510
They, they lay on the,

76
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,740
the very back of the chest, leaving the
spine one vertebrae at a time.

77
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,640
These nerve pathways synapse onto ganglia.

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,230
And then have projections out onto many
different organs in the body.

79
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,040
We learned earlier about how many of the
consequences of activating a stress

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,110
response, like dilating pupils and slowing
digestion, and increased heart rate.

81
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,380
Well many of these responses are caused by
activating this neural circuit.

82
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,280
The heart, which responds to both
sympathetic and

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,900
parasympathetic input, is a great example
of

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,920
an organ that is regulated by these higher
inputs from brain centers.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,660
We also used another measure in addition
to heart rate called skin conductance,

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,020
as an indictator of how stressed how,

87
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,150
how stressed Anne was during the
storytelling video.

88
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:33,950
Skin conductance, often referred to as
electrodermal activity, is a measure of

89
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,010
how long it takes an electrical current to
pass across the surface of the skin.

90
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,750
We use the sensor arm band,

91
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,620
which is a device that has two electrodes
spaced about an inch apart on Anne's skin.

92
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,010
That was, that, that sent an electrical
impulse that is recorded by the device.

93
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,900
The amount of time it takes for the signal
to reach the other electrode,

94
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,180
is influenced by a lot of different
factors.

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,720
Including factors that were out of our
control when studying Anne.

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,600
But one of those factors was whether Anne
was sweating or not.

97
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,420
And it just so

98
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,200
happens that skin conductance can be a
good indicator of sympathetic activation.

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,590
Because your sweat glands are activated by
the sympathetic branch.

100
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,960
In some sense, skin conductance is an even
clear indicator of sympathetic arousal

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
than heart rate.

102
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,340
Because unlike heart rate, the sweat
glands do not have parasympathetic input.

103
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,560
So what does that mean?

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,400
It means in the right environment when you
start sweating,

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,519
it's a pretty good indicator of when
you're starting to get stressed out.

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,020
It's important to note that when
conducting a research study,

107
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,570
a lot of effort goes in controlling
variables.

108
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,380
More effort than we did in this case study
in the field with Anne.

109
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,982
Nevertheless, I think it still tells a
pretty good story about how

110
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,529
Anne's skydiving stress affected her body.

111
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,180
When dealing with electrodermal activity,
researchers generally look for

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,310
changes in values over periods of time.

113
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,160
Boiling down to a rather simple concept.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,400
You're looking for how an external event,
like skydiving.

115
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,930
Changes sweating in a, in a short period
over seconds.

116
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,030
Or you're looking for

117
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,030
a general changes of arousal over a longer
period of time, like minutes.

118
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,310
In our case, we are looking at both.

119
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,530
And we are interested in how Anne's
sweating,

120
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,870
served as an indicator of Anne getting
stressed throughout her experience.

121
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,250
We see here three particular time points
where Anne's sympathetic nervous system,

122
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,640
turned on the sweat glands in her body.

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,770
Giving us a pretty good sense of the time
points during the skydive when stress was

124
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,720
being turned on.

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,320
We first arrived at the facility when we
first arrived at the facility,

126
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,580
you see Anne's skin conductance values
jump up and maintain.

127
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,658
Indicating to us that she might have been
pretty nervous during

128
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,200
that preparatory process.

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,570
As you also might expect, she experienced
an increase in sweating and sympathetic

130
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,760
activation following opening of the door,
and her big jump from the plane.

131
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,050
You might know from your own experience,

132
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,070
something really strange that happens with
memory and emotions.

133
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,330
And that's the, we tend to remember the
most emotionally-intense moments

134
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,870
in our lives.

135
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,000
I can still remember, in vivid detail, my
first kiss.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,340
The higher school dance I was at, the song
that was playing.

137
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,300
And where my girlfriend and I were
standing on the dance floor.

138
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,860
For me it was really intense and exciting
moment at that time in my life.

139
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,500
And, and all things considered it's kind
of strange and amazing, that I remember so

140
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,035
many details from that moment.

141
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:51,540
Given how much I have forgotten between
now and my 14 year old self.

142
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,450
Studies have replicated this observation
that, that we tend to

143
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,920
remember experiences in which we were
strongly, emotionally aroused.

144
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,330
Like for those people who've experienced
an earthquake or saw an accident.

145
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,480
Many Americans and

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,170
others around the world, remember exactly
where they were when JFK was assassinated.

147
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,780
Or exactly where they were or

148
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,527
what they were doing when the planes hit
the twin towers on 9/11.

149
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,660
Stress plays a role in enhancing memory
formation.

150
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,550
Sympathetically enhanced memory, or
remembering more when you are stressed,

151
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,930
seems to be due to the increased
availability of nutrients.

152
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,710
As you know, the stress responses
increases the delivery of

153
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,620
these nutrients by increasing cardiac
output.

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,600
And increasing glucose availability
through hormones that are released.

155
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,900
That increase in oxygen and glucose levels
to the brain, promotes memory formation.

156
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
And it could explain why we seem so

157
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,330
much better at remembering emotionally
charged events in our lives.

158
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,650
It's pretty unlikely that Anne will forget
her skydive experience anytime soon.

159
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,210
Even if she can't remember what she had
for lunch two days ago.

160
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,310
And it has everything to do with
sympathetic arousal of the stress

161
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,980
response, and its impact on storage in the
brain.

162
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,354
When experiencing extreme and traumatic
emotional events,

163
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:17,458
it seems that there's this upside-down
u-shaped relationship between memory and

164
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,110
the intensity of the stressor.

165
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,110
Where moderate stress, like when I
received my first kiss,

166
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,670
leads to an increase in the likelihood of
memory formation.

167
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,160
Now, taken to the extreme, high arousal
events seem to

168
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,260
reduce the likelihood that the person will
form a strong memory.

169
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,790
And possibly even cause loss of brain
hippocampal cells in the process.

170
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,880
Why this happens sometimes, and you know
why people sometimes block out,

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,670
or, or forget, the most traumatic events
of their lives, isn't entirely understood.

172
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,190
But at least one theory in the literature
points to glucocorticoids like cortisol.

173
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,140
And the dangers it poses to brain cells in
high concentrations.

174
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,990
Or when present for a long period of time.

175
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,040
It ends up that stress and performance is
a pretty tricky topic for scientists.

176
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,820
And there isn't really a consensus about
how and

177
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,150
why certain at certain times people
perform better when they're stressed.

178
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,150
And at other times they perform worse.

179
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,840
Getting stressed certainly makes us better
at some things.

180
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,900
Like remembering past times that we were
stressed and getting prepared to run.

181
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,600
And it makes us worse at other things like
dealing with social relationships and

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
thinking creatively.

183
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,300
But what about in the case of, you know,
taking tests and cognitive performance?

184
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,820
As you recall from our replay of the
testing we did at SkyDive Las Vegas Anne's

185
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,620
cognitive performance was affected by her
stress experience.

186
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,610
In a cognitive performance task that
tested short-term memory,

187
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,480
where the task of image and word recall.

188
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,040
Anne remembered fewer words after she
experienced skydive stress,

189
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,450
than when compared to her baseline
condition the previous day.

190
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,930
So what's going on here?

191
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,710
Why do some people rise to the occasion
and perform well when they're stressed?

192
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,660
And others who experience the exact same
stressor, don't?

193
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,570
Well the, the truth is, Anne's cognitive
performance is a little bit

194
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,360
hard to explain, given conflicting data
and literature.

195
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,620
But we could still take a scientific
approach to uncover a pattern,

196
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,550
that might be useful.

197
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,360
It seems that it's through the
individual's appraisal of the stressor,

198
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,960
or what that stressor means to them.

199
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,040
That we can make sense out of the stress
making us perform well, or not.

200
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,090
So here's the key.

201
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,140
If a stressor is seen as an obstacle that
can be overcome.

202
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,020
It tends to motivate better performance.

203
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,795
When a stressor is seen as,

204
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:55,780
as insurmountable, overwhelming or
distracting.

205
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,950
It tends to decrease performance outcomes.

206
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,400
The key concept here is that when stress
leads to increased motivation and

207
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,550
attention, it increases performance.

208
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,110
However when a tension is focused
elsewhere, performance tends to decline.

209
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,220
This isn't terribly complicated, either
way stress mobilizes energy.

210
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,400
But stress that motivates focus on a task
is good for performance.

211
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,480
And stress that distracts focus is bad for
performance.

212
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,870
In our case it seems that Anne's skydiving
stress,

213
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,720
distracted her from performing well on
that memory task the second time.

214
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
So at the end of the day,

215
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,520
science matters most to us when it can
make our lives better.

216
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,971
So, let's apply stress to something many
of us care about.

217
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,370
Our relationships.

218
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,760
As I alluded to earlier, one of our, one
area of our lives that are often greatly

219
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,220
injured by stress response is the world of
social relationships.

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,390
When you find yourself in the trenches,
getting stressed with your close friend,

221
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,270
a family member or a partner.

222
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,990
You're at greater risk of doing something
that you might later regret.

223
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,450
The times in my life when I've said the
most hurtful things to people that I love,

224
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,419
are times when I was in, was in like a
different state of mind.

225
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,976
John Gottman of the Gottman institute,

226
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,040
call this phenomenon, physiologic
flooding.

227
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,340
Physiologic flooding is the stress
response.

228
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,390
The flooding of certain systems that,

229
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,528
interestingly, when it comes to
relationships, seems to be a bad thing.

230
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:39,190
It turns out that some of our higher-order
brain functions,

231
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,150
tend not to work as well when we are
stressed out.

232
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,970
Something called cortical inhibition.

233
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,950
Our most recently area involved, areas of
the brain like the, the prefrontal cortex.

234
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,160
Help us navigate our complex social
worlds.

235
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,524
And tend to not function as well when
we're under stress.

236
00:14:56,524 --> 00:15:02,660
Gottman spent his entire career collecting
data on couples in his lab.

237
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,310
Observing times when they were connecting,
and times when they were fighting.

238
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,470
So one day he was doing a session in the
lab with a couple,

239
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,770
that was hopelessly stuck in a fight that
just was not resolving.

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,723
Both were aroused with high heart rates,
animated.

241
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:21,590
They were shouting, pointing and really
being monsters to one another.

242
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,140
And he was happy because he was getting
some good conflict data.

243
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,790
Until by accident, he had an issue with
his computer and data collection.

244
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,010
Embarrassed, he requested that the couple
to please pause their conflict, so

245
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,040
he could get the devices back online and
working again.

246
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,240
And that they just read a magazine, or

247
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,430
do something else until he alerted them to
continue.

248
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,780
And by the time he got the machines
working again, and

249
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,820
the couple continued, the most miraculous
thing had happened.

250
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,000
They were no longer physiologically
aroused.

251
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,780
And they had transformed from the ugly
monsters,

252
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,000
into reasonable people who quickly, worked
through their issue.

253
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
Later work in the lab repeated the same
finding.

254
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,920
Discovering what he refers to again,
physiologic flooding.

255
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,269
When his subjects and conflict had heart
rates that increase into the mid 90s.

256
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,852
So the point at which sympathetic input
begins,

257
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,320
indicating the start of the stress
response.

258
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,250
Those people were less empathetic.

259
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,830
They were less resourceful, and overall
much crappier relationship partners.

260
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,008
Now when we, when we asked them to pause
long enough to reduce the,

261
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:35,780
the flooding, they were much more able to
create better relationship outcomes.

262
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,430
So now, you're able to make sense out of

263
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,850
the poor choices you've made in the past
when in a stressed out state.

264
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,860
You may not have a heart rate monitor
handy.

265
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,450
But lucky for

266
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,880
us, we can learn to know what it feels
like in our body to become stressed.

267
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,750
Now that you know about cortical
inhibition and physiologic flooding.

268
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,520
You know when that anxiety or fear starts
creeping up, that you're body and

269
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,690
brain may not be in the best place for
making relationship choices.

270
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,130
It's a good time to remove yourself from
the situation.

271
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,880
Employ yourself soothing technique.

272
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,780
Do what you can to come back to neutral,
before reengaging.

273
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,660
We will learn some self, self soothing
practices in the later modules.

274
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,710
In the mean time, it seems that mom's old
wisdom for

275
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,939
counting to ten has some real scientific
support.

276
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,340
So that wraps up our lecture on how stress
gets nervous.

277
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,250
The brain plays a vital role in the stress
response.

278
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,840
Initiating chemical and

279
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,224
electrical signals that alerts the body to
respond appropriately.

280
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,358
It can improve our chances of forming
memories.

281
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:48,290
And sometimes, impair some of our
abilities to function.

282
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,030
In the case of stage fright, test anxiety
and physiologic flooding in relationships.

283
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,160
I can't tell you how much creating an
awareness around flooding,

284
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,980
has contributed to my life.

285
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,750
And helped me to make better choices.

286
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,730
I challenge you to incorporate this
knowledge into your own life.

287
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,060
And make a choice to help calm yourself
down the next time

288
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,700
you get flooded in a sticky relationship
situation.

289
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,830
Do a little science experimentation and
just see if you get a better result.

290
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,030
That's all we got for stress in the brain.

291
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,930
I'll see you in the next one.
