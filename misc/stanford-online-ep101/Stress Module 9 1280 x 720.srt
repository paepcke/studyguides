1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome back to the Physiology of Stress.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,070
It's finally time to put our knowledge
together to explore some

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,130
practical tools that have the potential to
totally change your life for the better.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,450
We've had an exciting journey through the
body and

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,249
it's time to put that little cherry on top
of our physiology knowledge.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,430
We're going to talk about three tools
commonly used to manage stress that

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,710
have been developed and well studied by
researchers.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,060
However, keep in mind that these
techniques are just

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,915
a sampling of the unlimited number of ways
to engage your restorative physiology.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,710
Throughout the course of human history,
we've used tools like yoga, meditation,

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,510
prayer, breathing techniques and others to
engage this restorative system,

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,950
that the techniques are, are designed to
engage.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,770
Now we've chosen to highlight these few
particular tools because they

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,430
have a lot of scientific support, but

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,420
that doesn't mean that there aren't a lot
of equally great tools out there.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,880
You have to decide which tools and
approaches work best for you.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,750
The most important thing is that you have
a set of tools that work for

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,159
you, and that you use them.

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,890
So let's see what these tools are and

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,590
the research that makes the argument that
they're worth using.

21
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,910
Returning to our favorite science of
stress model,

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,170
remember that science gives us this
nuanced understanding of stress.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,570
Stress is absolutely and undoubtedly an
awesome thing to have in our lives.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,830
It prepares us to confront life's
obstacles by mobilizing the resources we

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,312
need to become version 2.0 of yourself.

26
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,880
A you 2.0.

27
00:01:56,555 --> 00:02:00,650
Now at the same time we know that chronic
stress is really harmful to our health.

28
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,800
And as a result, there are two primary
ways we

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,840
can think about having a better
relationship with stress.

30
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,990
The first thing, is that we can leverage
stress to work for us better.

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,520
That means increasing the amplitude of our
stress response to make the biggest,

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,970
baddest, most constructively stressed
version of ourselves that exists.

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,920
The second thing we can do is when it's no
longer helpful to be

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,380
stressed it's absolutely necessary that

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,040
we transition ourselves from a state of
stress to recovery.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,670
So that we avoid trailing off into the
chronic stress danger zone.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,890
We're going to go into depth on three
tools that have scientific support.

38
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,830
Two will be in the second category of
going from stress to recovery.

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,258
And because having tools to make that
transition are so

40
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,410
important, that's what we're going to
start with.

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,130
So the first of these category two
techniques that we'll touch on is called

42
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,410
freeze frame, and it's what I refer to as
an emotional approach to stress reduction.

43
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,940
It was created by emotion experts at
HeartMath Institute here in California.

44
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,100
We did an abridged version of this
technique to engage our bodies before

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,280
discussing the physiology of the
parasympathetic nervous system.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,210
And you can see me over here doing it.

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,440
Freeze frame involves calling attention to
your heart and

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,360
solar plexus in activating a positive
feeling.

49
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,590
It's a technique that is designed to
replace an unproductive emotion

50
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,970
with a more productive one.

51
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,280
Similar to all the tools that influence us
to enter into that state of recovery,

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,070
it's associated with many of the benefits
of increasing vagal tone.

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,090
Remember, use of this tool can actually
train you to increase vagal tone and

54
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,170
to reap all of the associated benefits.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,520
One important thing to note is that this
tool is not the same

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,850
as relaxing and taking nap.

57
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,200
It involves attention, and focus to the
steps mentioned beside me.

58
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,280
On the right side of the screen you can
see the major steps to

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,450
the freeze frame technique.

60
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,970
At the end of this section,

61
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,950
we will have the opportunity to meet one
of the developers of this technique,

62
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,380
and learn directly from him how to use it.

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,460
So what's so great about the research at
HeartMath Institute is that it

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,120
is explore the lesser known but equally
important aspect of the stress experience.

65
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,620
Emotion.

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,620
As much as the feelings of anxiety, and
frustration, or

67
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,510
hopelessness are part of our experience of
stress, it's kind of amazing that many

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,200
academic conversations about stress leave
the emotional aspect out of the picture.

69
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,316
An entire field of research in emotion
physiology is exploring and

70
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:08,073
teaching us that the autonomic nervous
system is intimately involved and, and

71
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:11,370
responsive to emotional states that we
experience.

72
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,630
Work done at HeartMath demonstrates that
positive emotional states like

73
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,440
appreciation increase heart rate
variability and

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,040
create a more optimal heart activity that
is

75
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,670
disrupted during negative emotional states
like frustration.

76
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,130
They've found that positive emotions like
compassion and appreciation lead to

77
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,500
a smooth, ordered, rhythmical pattern in
heart rate variability.

78
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,600
As you can see beside me, the graph
depicts what you would,

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,740
you know, what would happen to you if you
were to employ the freeze frame strategy.

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,220
The jagged, incoherent activity is
characterized of

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,290
how the heart behaves when you're feeling
frustrated.

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,580
And the smooth, sine like waves,

83
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,420
are characteristic of how your heart
behaves when you feel appreciative.

84
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,560
You'll see when he does this technique on
me,

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,480
how crazy it is that changing how you feel
actually changes how your heart behaves.

86
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,870
And that by engaging your physiology with
breathing, and

87
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,570
making a sincere effort to shift your
emotional state,

88
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,660
it can have a profound impact on how you
feel and how you behave.

89
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,260
It only takes a few minutes and it can be
really effective right before

90
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,920
taking a test, mid-fight with your
boyfriend or

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,370
girlfriend, or as a way to freeze the
frame amid some

92
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,060
other stressful episode where you might
need access to better mental resources.

93
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,650
Psychologists, military leaders and

94
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,130
personal coaches all over the world employ
this technique to shift your

95
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,860
physiology into a more productive state so
that you can perform better.

96
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,900
The bottom line is they use it because it
works.

97
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,540
The second technique is called the
relaxation response.

98
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,000
I call it a cognitive stress reduction
approach because it attempts to

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,290
reduce stress by breaking the train of
everyday thinking.

100
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,170
Minimizing those thoughts, that lead to
provoking the stress response.

101
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:18,950
Click.

102
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,280
Created by doctor Herbert Benson of
Harvard Medical School, the relaxation

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,090
response is a stress reduction tool
inspired by Eastern traditions, and

104
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,390
designed as a synthesis of the most
important elements of historical and

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,855
religious calming strategies.

106
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,947
Dr. Benson is truly an inspirational
physician and

107
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,970
is a pioneer of mind/body medicine.

108
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,680
The relaxation response incorporates a
restful position of deep breathing with

109
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,320
a mental device, a mantra to focus on, and
a passive attitude.

110
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,500
It's important to note that like freeze
frame, the relaxation response is not

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,060
the same as just lying down and taking a
nap, or just relaxing in some other way.

112
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,850
It's an intentional more like meditation
technique

113
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,750
that produces benefits by breaking the
train of your scattered thought.

114
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:22,590
The research demonstrates there are
immediate short term and long term

115
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,090
benefits associated with activating the
vagus system with the relaxation response.

116
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,030
Since the very first studies that Dr.

117
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,640
Benson performed on transcendental
mediators in the late 1960s, one of

118
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,320
the hallmark features of the relaxation
response is reduced oxygen consumption.

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,970
A general quieting of metabolic activity.

120
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,520
A reduction in oxygen consumption and
carbon dioxide elimination is indicative

121
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,440
of what, what we call a hypometabolic
state.

122
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,980
Sleep, hypnosis, hibernation, those are
all examples of a hypometabolic state.

123
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,490
Because hypometabolism is a pretty rare
state for

124
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,840
the body to be in, the ability to
cultivate a tool that can

125
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,290
place the body into a quieted state is
actually pretty profound.

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,230
However, what is most unique and exciting
about the work done by Benson, and

127
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,990
his team at Harvard are the genomic
studies done in the most recent years.

128
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,240
Researchers looker at differences of the
level of genetic expression between groups

129
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,410
of people who regularly evoke the
relaxation response and those who don't.

130
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,730
They've also done prospective experiments,
experiments looking at

131
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,050
genetic changes in individuals who
underwent two months of relaxation,

132
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,350
relaxation response elicitation training.

133
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,160
And lo and behold, what they found was
that the consistent use of

134
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,550
the relaxation response not only changed
your physiology in the short term,

135
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,050
it actually changes the body at the level
of genetic expression.

136
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,480
Changes in genetic expression clustered
around the four main focus hubs that

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,520
you can see beside me.

138
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,650
It's incredible that changing your
behavior can change the genes your

139
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,630
body expresses.

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,870
And even more incredible to hypothesize
what those long term benefits might be.

141
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,870
You can see the four hubs beside me.

142
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,240
The first, improved mitochondrial
function.

143
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,010
It's a gene, they're gene sets linked to
energy metabolism like

144
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,687
the electron transport chain in your
powerhouse mitochondria cells, and

145
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,430
they're up-regulated in the long term
group of the relaxation response.

146
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,645
Its hypothesized to increase oxidative
efficiancy and to reduce or,

147
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,910
or to quite oxidative stress.

148
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,960
The second hub was insulin secretion
pathways and they were up-regulate,

149
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,620
up-regulated, which has the potential for
positive implications for a lot of chron,

150
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,250
for a particularly important chronic
disease, type two diabetes.

151
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,930
The third hub, was a reduction in an
immune marker, NF-kappaB,

152
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,770
which reduces systemic stress by slowing
the inflammatory cascade.

153
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,520
Which means reducing inflammation in the
body.

154
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,650
The fourth major hub was that there were
changes in

155
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,357
genetic clustering around telomere
stabilization.

156
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,432
For those of you who aren't quite familiar
with what telomeres are,

157
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:38,820
telomeres are the repetitive sequences
that protect the genetic material at

158
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,799
the end of the chromosome.

159
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,390
Long telomeres are associated with healthy
cells that can continue to reproduce.

160
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,040
Whereas shortened telomeres are associated
with chronic stress and with aging.

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,550
The relaxation response seems to have a
stabilizing effect

162
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,899
on telomere degradation.

163
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,900
Slowing aging, at the genetic level.

164
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,390
We're going to have an incredible
opportunity to speak with Dr.

165
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,750
Benson himself in the expert section of
this module,

166
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,420
where he will show us personally how to
best elicit the relaxation response.

167
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,480
Freeze frame, and the relaxation response
are two scientifically supported

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,930
techniques to help you transition from a
state of stress to a state of recovery.

169
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,440
If there is any place to start working on
your relationship with stress,

170
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,499
it's right here in that number two
category.

171
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,120
They have all sorts of benefits in the
short term, and

172
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,120
the long term that scientists are just
beginning to sort out.

173
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,170
The good news is, is that by using them,
you can cultivate increase to vagal tone,

174
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,410
and activate the recovery system that we
have within us to reduce our

175
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,130
exposure to chronic stress.

176
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,720
The good news is, is that the better you
become at transitioning to states of

177
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,915
recovery after stress, the better your
good stress will become.

178
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:10,570
Indigated, indicated here by the 1 bubble,

179
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,780
the best thing you can do to increase good
stress is to decrease the bad stress.

180
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,430
Reducing chronic stress allows your body
to perform its natural housekeeping

181
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,155
functions so that the various systems of
the body will respond optimally,

182
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:30,535
like a well-serviced car, during times of
stress.

183
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,377
But it doesn't stop there.

184
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:36,556
There are other things you can do to
optimize your stress response as well.

185
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:42,224
Sleep, diet and exercise all promote your
body's ability to

186
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:48,615
initiate a strong respo, a strong
fortified stress response.

187
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,360
Remember, in the right situation being
stressed and

188
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,750
physically aroused makes our lives better.

189
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,600
So we can also leverage science to amplify
the stress response.

190
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,660
In addition to general health, scientists
have discovered another clever way to

191
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,840
optimize the stress response by doing this
fancy thing called cognitive reappraisal.

192
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,419
It's a way to make your stress response
work for you better.

193
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,570
Really, cognitive reappraisal isn't
anything more complicated then just

194
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,860
changing your belief about stress.

195
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,460
And in this case, it's changing your
belief to a more positive one.

196
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,420
All right, so here's what the researchers
did.

197
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,850
They brought the students who were
preparing to take the GRE.

198
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,640
And the GRE's a really important graduate
level exam.

199
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,790
And they brought them into the lab to take
a pretend GRE test.

200
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,880
They split them into three different
groups.

201
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,400
One group was the suppression group.

202
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,970
And they were instructed that, if they
were to feel a feeling of anxiety,

203
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,170
which makes sense that they would feel it,

204
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,930
they're pretty nervous about taking this
important test.

205
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,110
If they feel an anxiety they were
instructed to do their best to

206
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,110
push that feeling of anxiety away.

207
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,330
A second group was a control group and
they were, they were left on their own,

208
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,840
they weren't instructed to do anything but
take the test.

209
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,459
And the third group, they were the
cognitive reappraisal group.

210
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,350
This special third group was instructed to
believe something different about stress.

211
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,540
They were told by the researchers that
stress was a good thing and

212
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,760
that in fact that when they feel anxiety
that means

213
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,710
their bodies are mobilizing resources in
order to be able to, to succeed.

214
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,630
And that in fact, that stress and anxiety
will help you perform better on the GRE.

215
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,150
Kind of miraculously, the cognitive
reappraisal group that

216
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,800
went through the intervention to develop
this more positive belief about stress,

217
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,740
actually performed better on the practice
test.

218
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
But the real crazy thing is,

219
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,040
is that same group performed better on the
real test many weeks later.

220
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,320
A follow up study explored a physiological
explanation for

221
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,210
how these amazing results could be
possible.

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,370
As we know, stress is a physical change in
the body.

223
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,920
So how is it possible that a belief could
make a difference?

224
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,640
Well, it turns out that when we change our
belief about what stress means,

225
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,290
it not only improves our performance and

226
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,510
lowers anxiety, but it actually changes
the stress response itself.

227
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,190
The reappraisal group showed similar
patterns of stress arousal as the other

228
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,030
groups, with one notable exception.

229
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,890
In comparison, the reappraisal group was
characterized by a reduction in

230
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,200
peripheral vasoconstriction.

231
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,340
The other two groups, they got stressed
and their vessels tightened up, but

232
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,180
the reappraisal group had vessels that
were more open and relaxed.

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,890
Skinny tight vessels provide a lot of
resistance to blood that's

234
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,790
trying to get through.

235
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,230
But relaxed, more open vessels allow more
nutrient rich blood

236
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,280
to flow through the body.

237
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,249
What you believe about stress matters, if
you want to be a high performer.

238
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,430
So it's about time that you gave yourself
the gift of a little belief makeover.

239
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,560
Preliminary research here at Stanford is
suggesting that this particular

240
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,270
intervention might be particularly helpful
for those of you who are anxiety prone.

241
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,990
Next time you're stressed, particularly if
it's a time you're about to perform,

242
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,820
say, a speech or step onto a sports field
or take a test.

243
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
Remember, that feeling of anxiety is your

244
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,710
body's way of telling you that it's
transforming into version 2.0.

245
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,100
And its ready to do one heck of a good
job.

246
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,450
This brings us to the end of our
incredible journey

247
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,940
exploring stress together.

248
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,110
We have gained a deep appreciation and
understanding of the role

249
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,850
the vagus nerve and parasympathetic
nervous system play in our daily lives.

250
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,100
And what we can do to cultivate it's
activation.

251
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,190
We've learned, that with just a little
vagal tone, we might just be able to be

252
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,240
more compassionate, more healthy, and
function at a higher level.

253
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,540
While I encourage you to experiment with
these techniques I don't want you

254
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,520
to forget that there are many other great
ways to activate this vagus system and

255
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,540
to optimize the relationship between
stress and recovery.

256
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,460
So don't be discouraged if these
particular techniques don't resonate with

257
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,360
most, most strongly with you.

258
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,560
The best tools are the ones that work for
you, whatever those tools are.

259
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,330
The bottom line is,

260
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,320
is that you need good strategies to
transition to recovery after stress.

261
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,940
And, you would be remiss to not capitalize
on how to make stress work for

262
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
you instead of against you.

263
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,920
I really hope you found this module to be
instructive, practical and entertaining.

264
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,732
Though stress is one of the biggest
challenges we face today,

265
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:20,940
as individuals and as a s, s, society, the
exciting thing

266
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,060
is that you now have the knowledge and the
tools to take responsibility for

267
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,580
making your life better and manage stress
in a more productive way.

268
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm so excited to see what it is that you
choose to do with this knowledge.

269
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,900
It's been a great honor to speak with you
about a topic that I'm so

270
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,800
passionate about.

271
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,380
I extend my deepest gratitude for

272
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,490
the opportunity to share our experience
with you today.

273
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,360
Science is awesome!

274
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,940
Let's continue to use it and make our
lives better.
