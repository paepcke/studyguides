1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,310
The way I recommend that you practice
this,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,100
is challenging yourself in a different
way.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,108
>> Can I maintain that coherence with
somebody that.

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,090
>> Stresses me out.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,560
>> Stresses you out, exactly.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,700
Because that's really what this is about,

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,195
is being able to take these techniques
into the real world.

8
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,000
>> Dr. Rollin McCraty is director of
research of

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,750
the heart math research center at The
Institute of Hearth Math.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,150
A non profit research and

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,650
educational organization located in
Boulder Creek, California.

12
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:30,420
Heart Math is at the cutting edge of
creating positive emotion focus,

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,620
intervention tools, and technologies which
have been demonstrated to reduce stress,

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,825
enhance health and performance, and
improve quality of life.

15
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:43,450
Dr. McCraty has an extensive professional
background in research and

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,260
development, systems engineering, and
instrumentation design.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,580
He received his Masters in radiational
physics, and his PhD in health sciences.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,280
After a successful engineering career, Dr.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,680
McCraty's research interests lead him to
establish the Heart Math Research Center.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Where he applied his background in
engineering to the study of

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,660
emotion physiology, and the development of
cutting edge interventions for

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,240
stress reduction and optimal performance.

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,110
As a result of Dr. McCraty's and Heart
Math's life, millions of people have been

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,630
positively impacted by their technologies,
and their educational programs.

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,540
So for those reasons and many others it's
a great honor to now turn to

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,489
our experiential interview and stress
physiology with Dr. Rolland McCraty.

27
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,660
Dr. McCraty thank you so much for being
with us today.

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,230
>> Oh.
>> It's a real honor.

29
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,200
>> My pleasure Cory.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,300
It's it's great being here.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,220
>> Yeah it's great to have you.

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,890
So I thought a great place to start today
would be with your own personal story.

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,720
So what was it that got you interested in
stress, positive emotions and

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,420
ultimately developing these stress
intervention tools?

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,580
>> Wow, well the, the honest answer to
that is at the,

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,880
the time I really got interested in this
type of things was I owned

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,550
a A company I had founded, and a few years
into it it was successful, and we were

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,288
doing very large scale installations in
the field of electrostatics.

39
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:10,900
And, big manufacturing plants,

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,858
like Chrysler, Ford and head offices all
over the world.

41
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,920
And especially in,

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,070
in the US companies it amazed me that
these companies could stay in business.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,560
To be honest the amount of dysfunction
that was going on between unions and

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,780
workers and management and, I mean,

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,570
I, because I had to inter- I had to deal
with all levels.

46
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,190
>> Mm-hm.
>> To get what we were trying to do in

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,930
these factories.

48
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,860
And it just struck me that something's
gotta change.

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,500
There's gotta be some better way for us to
get along with each other, and

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,410
cooperate, and collaborate, rather than
the constant fighting, and

51
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,440
looking out for self over everything else.

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,430
So that was one of the, the turning points
for me.

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,895
And I think, probably honestly speaking,
around that same time period,

54
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:07,770
I kind of been in to the humanities
earlier and kind of got fed up with that,

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,698
and so I'll go make money again, and
started that company.

56
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,330
But I was also realizing that same time
period,

57
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,440
that another sports car in the driveway
wasn't going to really do it for me.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,720
So I really wanted to do something more to
help people and you know,

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,110
a lot of people will say that but it was a
true kind of heart felt feeling for me.

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,520
>> That's incredible so then that brought
you to Heart Math.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,750
>> You know that was I wont say accidental
but

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,120
I, Heart Math didn't exist at that time
but I met the founder of Heart Math.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,940
Through some mutual friends, And Doc, a
guy named Doc Childry, and with actually

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,670
on business on the east coast where he was
at that time in North Carolina.

65
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,190
So I thought I'd go meet him,

66
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,110
spend an hour meet this guy that friends
had told me about.

67
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,260
Ended up spending three days with him,

68
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,500
we in his some people in his group, around
him.

69
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,090
Just hit it off, just became good friends,
and, and

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,660
he told me that his vision, and resonated
with me, so.

71
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,960
>> And the rest is history.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,139
>> And the rest is history.

73
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,160
>> So, that's a nice segue into talking a
little bit about heart math, and

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,650
the Institute of Heart Math.

75
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,780
So, what are they, and what are some of
the, the tools and

76
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,390
the educational programs you've developed?

77
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,610
>> Okay, well, the Institute of Heart Math
is a nonprofit research and

78
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,640
educational organization.

79
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,440
You know, we obviously do both fair amount
of energy into research.

80
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,850
And we're primarily a basic physiology
research facility.

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,360
Then we enjoy a lot of collaborative
relationships with research centers and

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,080
universities, really around the world.

83
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,940
Especially when it comes to the applied
science side.

84
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,325
You know so if we're working with the
clinical population, or

85
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,536
an organizational population, that's
always in partnership with someone else.

86
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:54,240
But Heart Math is, probably the simplest
way I can say it, it's a set of tools,

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,650
techniques, and technologies that help
people learn how to better self regulate.

88
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,540
But to do that from a more intelligent
inner reference point,

89
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,770
is as if you can tell people you should do
this, you should eat this way,

90
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,940
don't smoke, do this do that, but that
doesn't really do much, unless it

91
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,965
comes from your own inner, inner guidance
if you will, or locust of control.

92
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,550
>> Mm-hm.

93
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,410
>> So, the tools and techniques, as we
like to say, in,

94
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,410
in fact, in our mission statement is,

95
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,190
it's really helping people align with the
intelligence of their own heart.

96
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,760
And that helps unfold who they truly are.

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,840
So that's what, what they're about.

98
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,610
>> So that's what you do.

99
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,210
>> That's what I do.

100
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,800
>> And then that applied, the applied
science and

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,130
the technology is really what has
attracted us to you.

102
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,040
>> Mm-hm.
>> Find it really, really incredible and

103
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,610
fascinating work.

104
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,870
So before we move more towards talking
about the science.

105
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,940
One thing that I found really fascinating
about your own story is that

106
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,470
you have made pretty big career change.

107
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,680
And a successful background in
engineering, systems engineering and

108
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,940
instrumentation design and then, a switch
over to Heart Math.

109
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,180
And I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about the journey from point

110
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,600
A to point B, and how you've been able to
leverage your knowledge of physics and

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
engineering into the work you currently
do?

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,050
>> Well, looking backwards it was a
perfect combination.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,100
Of course, in the field of
psycho-physiology there's a lot of

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,320
equipment involved.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,520
You've got to hook up electrodes up to
people, and do you know,

116
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,598
these measurements of having my electronic
training background made that

117
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:29,730
a lot easier and so the psycho-physiology
was really my second career.

118
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,226
And really honest,

119
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:37,550
probably not having a formal academic
education in it was really beneficial.

120
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,390
Because we didn't know what wouldn't work
So we tried things that most would say,

121
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,160
no that won't work don't try that.

122
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,260
>> So you'd say you, you weren't limited
by the, the standard academic approach?

123
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,930
>> To be true, to be honest, really
honest.

124
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,220
So, I got into this, before I got any
formal education in psycho-physiology,

125
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,125
I later on went and got a PhD in it.

126
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,160
But in the beginning, in fact I remember
many, many years ago,

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,140
probably close to 30 years ago.

128
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,350
Driving over here to Stanford actually,
from where I live, Boulder Creek,

129
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,960
to the book store and trying to find a
book on electoral cardiograms.

130
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,220
I got a, what is this stuff?

131
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,014
Figure out how to read it,

132
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:20,530
and so we spent a few months just reading
and understanding it, and

133
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:27,150
wiring people up and we got onto some
things in our early years.

134
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,760
One of the maybe help answer that
question.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,585
We had already sort of an, call it an
intuitive knowledge and

136
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:38,109
understanding that it just made sense that
if we're feeling better.

137
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:43,079
You know, like appreciating, or caring, or
being compassionate, that ought to

138
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,141
have a physiological correlate with it you
know, that's hopefully beneficial.

139
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,728
And so we we're that time,

140
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:54,282
well this is 1991, somewhere in there,
that all the library searches and

141
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:58,930
all that, before we had all the
online/Medline searches, by the way.

142
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,490
You actually had to go to libraries and
look up references and

143
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,320
go find things back then.

144
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,990
>> It's a different world.

145
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,310
>> It's a different world, but at that
time there were three,

146
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,660
maybe four publications that I could find
that were looking at the effect, or

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,610
the physiological correlates of positive
emotions in the scientific literature.

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,390
It's hardly anything.

149
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,680
Now of course there are, you know, it's
quite different.

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,460
We even have a whole field called positive
psychology now.

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,700
But anyway we, we got onto well let's look
at positive states.

152
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,210
From a physiological perspective.

153
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,250
Not just stress and negative ones.

154
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,960
And that was, turned out to have been the
right approach.

155
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,490
And so we were doing all these little
three letter acronyms,

156
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,900
you know EEGs and GSRs and ECGs and all of
that stuff at that time.

157
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,570
And what we found, we were taking a little
bit deeper look at the heart.

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,042
You know with the forced ECGs, what kept
happening was, it was a change in

159
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,345
the heart rhythm pattern, which is now
called heart variability.

160
00:08:56,345 --> 00:09:00,140
We were sort of doing this even before
that term was coined.

161
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,148
That was the most reflective emotional
state, and

162
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:06,630
this time, nobody even thought of looking
that I don't think.

163
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,450
That actually drew the attention of what
ended up being some some mentors that I

164
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,340
really appreciate, one of them being Carl
Preben.

165
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,600
A name you might know cause he was the
director of here at Stanford of

166
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,376
brain research for, I think for 30 years,
very famous guy.

167
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,986
So he got interested in our stuff, I found
out later,

168
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,190
it was confirming one of his theories.

169
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,040
Didn't know that at the time, why he was
so interested.

170
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,820
But he ended up being a great champion.

171
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,080
Still is actually, Carl's 94 years old
now, and still teaching actually.

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,800
Now teaching at Georgetown a couple days a
week But then a few other mentors,

173
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,020
and that worked through to us.

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,830
I'm making a long story short here, but,
like Don Singer who's the man who's

175
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,090
credited with coining the term heart rate
variability.

176
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,580
He's on our advisory board and, has been
for over 20 years.

177
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,510
Anyway a whole string of people like that.

178
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,870
So my education was really through mentors
and

179
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,790
which is a really neat way to do it, by
the way.

180
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,150
>> Mm hmm.
>> And they fussed at me and said, Okay,

181
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,620
if you're going know all this publishing,
you gotta have a PhD, go get a PhD.

182
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,470
>> And.
>> And I did that later on.

183
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,910
>> And so you did it.

184
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,660
So, that's a, that's a nice transition
now,

185
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,280
talking about some of the work that you do
at the institute.

186
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,530
So, there seems to be some central themes
that can be drawn out of a lot of

187
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,380
the educational programs and the tools
that you've developed.

188
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,440
And it seems to me that one of them, is
this concept of physiology coherence.

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,980
So what is physiological coherence, and

190
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,868
how can, how can understanding it help me
and you make our lives better.

191
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:42,850
>> Sure I don't want to give too long of
an answer here, but that term, coherence,

192
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,590
my advisory board I was telling you about,
it took us two years to agree on a term.

193
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,910
A lot of consideration went into that But
basically,

194
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,560
what it's really a term that describes, to
say it really simply, inner harmony.

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,030
In other words, the activity in our
physiology is cooperating.

196
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,410
You have synchronization, if we're talking
technically with

197
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,388
synchronization with different rhythms and
signals.

198
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:11,750
And many years and many studies later now,

199
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,030
it's been kind of confirmed as the
baseline state for optimal functioning.

200
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,260
Especially cognitive functioning.

201
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,870
And we got on to it from what I was
talking about earlier by looking at

202
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,300
heart rate variability, the beat can be
changed in variability, but

203
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,760
not how much variability.

204
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,320
Which is what most people still look at,
but the pattern of it.

205
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,040
So what we've found was that you can think
of the heart,

206
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,210
this beat to beat variability, it's like
morse code.

207
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,070
The heart's beating out a message, and

208
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,330
that message has profound influences on
brain functions.

209
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,150
So, when we're feeling, when we would do
things back end,

210
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,280
whether it was showing them films or, self
induction techniques.

211
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,050
You know, or throwing firecrackers at them
which we

212
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,350
literally did in one of our studies.

213
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,850
>> [LAUGH]
>> We had a lot of fun in the lab.

214
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,870
>> I'd love to read that paper.

215
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,870
>> Yeah.
I don't think we ever published that, but.

216
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,340
>> [LAUGH]
>> You have to get creative on

217
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,400
how you induce emotions.

218
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,710
>> It's very tricky.

219
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,660
>> You really do because once you do it
once, they're on to you.

220
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,580
But, anyway, what consistently I'd
mentioned earlier was

221
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,940
this heart rhythm was what reflected
emotions.

222
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,565
But what was happening when people were,

223
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:22,050
however we got them there, really feeling
a genuine, positive emotion.

224
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,770
Compassion, kindness, care, appreciation,
any of these.

225
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,520
The heart rhythm became a very different
pattern.

226
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,270
And it's like a sign wave pattern in the
rhythm, about a 10 second cycle rhythm.

227
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,626
And that was occurring no matter how we
got them their independent of you know,

228
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:43,312
control breathing, any of that, in fact we
left that out of the equation back then,

229
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,730
by my purpose, on purpose.

230
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,510
And that's what we ended up calling
coherence.

231
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,690
Cause as we dug deeper into that,
following the data, right,

232
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,390
we realized that that state was reflecting
increased synchronized activity.

233
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,480
Literally between the heart and brain,
which we went on to develop ways to

234
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,130
measure, you know, degree of synchronized
activity, literally.

235
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,460
And the degree of synchronized activity
between sympathetic and

236
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,300
parasympathetic branches of the nervous
system, and so on.

237
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,169
And between our respiratory rhythms, and
heart rhythms, and blood pressure rhythms.

238
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,880
was, was basically an optimal state.

239
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,140
The heart's doing a lot less work and

240
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,750
getting a lot more done when we're in that
state, for example but not just the heart.

241
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,860
It's a lot of effects on.

242
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,380
>> Hm.

243
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,625
The whole body?
>> The whole body, yeah,

244
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,930
for the central conductor, if you will,
the heart is.

245
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,610
>> So that's, that's really exciting.

246
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,340
>> Mm-hm.

247
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,850
>> And I'm very curious to see maybe at
the end of our interview today,

248
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,400
you might be able to teach me a way to
sort of get into that state.

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,460
>> Sure.

250
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,210
>> another, another central theme that
seems to be drawn out a lot of

251
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,000
the work is this, the, emotions, our
emotions.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,170
>> Mm-hm.
>> So,

253
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,790
what do emotions have to do with stress?

254
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,060
>> Well, good question, actually.

255
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,430
So, stress, right?

256
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,730
Kind of a safe word?

257
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,780
You know we say, you're stressing me out,
right?

258
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,580
What are we really saying?

259
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,520
Usually you're upsetting me.

260
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,900
You're causing me to feel frustrated, to
feel out of control, something.

261
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,004
So, the real essence of stress in most
cases, we're talking in

262
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:18,560
this domain it's always emotions, to have
two people on the roller coaster, right.

263
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,549
One person is white knuckle ahh, the other
person is yay,

264
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:23,990
right, going down the same ride.

265
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,660
It's a very different emotional response.

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,880
We can debate about what all the brain
mechanisms are and different appraisals

267
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,350
and perceptions and stuff, I have a little
different perspective on that than some.

268
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,230
But the point is, it's the emotion that is
what really is stress.

269
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,490
So for most people when we talk about
stress,

270
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,250
it's the emotional response, either to an
external or internal thing going on.

271
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,530
And that's important, because it's
emotions that drive physiology.

272
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,130
Really easy to see, in fact, on the
devices we make.

273
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,350
Like, if you're looking at the heart
rhythm, or blood pressure.

274
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,800
Doesn't really matter what physiological
measure you use.

275
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,790
You can have some pretty, somebody wired
up to all your equipment, and

276
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,710
having them think, or do cognitive tasks.

277
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,030
Yeah, you see some changes.

278
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,250
But you get' em, you induce an emotion,
you get' em pissed off, all right?

279
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,600
Or really caring about something,

280
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,920
and you see a lot of profound changes very
quickly.

281
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,790
So it's really the emotional system, is
this really higher up in the hierarchy,

282
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,440
of what drives physiological systems.

283
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,670
Whether we're talking about the HPA axis,
or autonomic function, and so on.

284
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,040
So the emotions I would say are the next
frontier,

285
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,770
in really understanding how to well, in,
certainly in human performance research.

286
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,480
>> Mm-hm.
And you guys have really taken,

287
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,025
you've really taken that a step further
into applying it with this concept of what

288
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,830
you've alluded to earlier, positive
emotions.

289
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,150
>> Sure.
>> So what has studying positive emotions

290
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,890
taught you about how we can better manage
our own stress states?

291
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,110
>> Yes well positive emotions are
certainly part of the equations but

292
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,180
managing our own stress states really
ultimately boils down to being able

293
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,040
to self regulate.

294
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,970
Make better choices, especially in the
moment.

295
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,370
You know it's kind of easy to feel good
and

296
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,620
self regulate, I call it in fair weather
times.

297
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,840
You know, all the traffic lights are green
and everything is going our way.

298
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,750
But to be able to do that when we're
challenged.

299
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,100
You know, when we're in the traffic jam or

300
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,390
the traffic jams of life, that's when it
really counts.

301
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,500
Can we really maintain that composure and

302
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,020
that ability to maintain, self regulate
ourselves then, is what's key.

303
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,940
So, once we understood the physiology, and

304
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,820
the benefits of feeling positive that
became a, a useful tool to self regulate.

305
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,370
In other words if we can activate a
positive feeling that's shifting our

306
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,940
physiology into this optimal state.

307
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,910
And that's having a profound influence on
cognitive function.

308
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,630
We make better choices right?

309
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,909
It opens, broadens, literally our
cognitive centers.

310
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,830
I mean I give an example if we have time.

311
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,570
>> Absolutely.

312
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,970
>> You may have probably never have done
this Corey but

313
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,550
you may be in dialogue with, I don't know
if you're married or

314
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,720
not but your girlfriend or colleague
whatever and

315
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,230
they say or do something that just kind of
gets you a little mad.

316
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,170
>> Oh, happens.

317
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:11,711
>> Happens.

318
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,116
>> It might have happened with my boss
today.

319
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,350
>> Yeah and then you say or do something?

320
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,840
You know, like, almost instantly after
that, and about a minute later you're

321
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,440
saying to yourself, oh my god, I can't
believe I just said that?

322
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,860
>> Oh, many times.

323
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,450
>> And does that usually create a lot more
stress and

324
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,830
energy drain that you have to clean that
up?

325
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,710
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

326
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,850
A whole mess to clean up.

327
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,580
>> A whole mess to clean up.

328
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,400
Yeah, so what happened?

329
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,020
Why when we were angry or

330
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,090
anxious state did we, that our brain, kind
of go into fog.

331
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,840
Right, so that's, was one of our, our
questions.

332
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,120
And as it turns out, there's a vast
literature on this.

333
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,360
In fact, one of the most famous hypothesis
in the field of

334
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,560
psychophysiology goes back to the 1970s.

335
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,160
And the term introduced back into the
describe that

336
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,410
very thing was called cortical inhibition.

337
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,220
So when the hearts in these erratic
patterns,

338
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,780
these incoherent states, it's basically
interfering with

339
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,670
the thalamus' ability to synchronize
activity of all our neurons.

340
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,550
Inhibiting cortical function.

341
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,242
So that's when we say or do the thing that
may not have been in our best interests,

342
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:22,410
so if we can learn to freeze that frame,
right?

343
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,360
Pause, learn that self-awareness.

344
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,510
Just take a few breaths, get ourselves
coherent, activate a positive feeling.

345
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,130
We go into that very different coherent
rhythm.

346
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,060
Now we're facilitating all those same
functions.

347
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,620
>> Mm-hm.

348
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,880
>> So we can make a better choice.

349
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,700
>> So the role of positive emotion seems
to be after creating awareness around

350
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,710
making a shift, is to, and do some more
optimal stay.

351
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,530
To make a better decision, and perhaps I
did the last time.

352
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,430
>> Yeah, or, or perform better.

353
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,350
We also know that coherence, that coherent
state is facilitates reaction times and

354
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,440
coordination, that's why it's so much in
athletics and professional athletic teams.

355
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,280
There's a carry over effect so, just being
in that coherent state for,

356
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,412
even a couple minutes, improves central
motor integration.

357
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,507
Those are reaction times, 37 milliseconds
on average for

358
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:11,660
example, which is huge, in sports.

359
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,240
>> Absolutely, so, one of the things that
maybe I can imagine myself or

360
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,920
other people associating with a lot of the
work you are talking about is

361
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,062
this concept of, of relaxation, sort of
calming the body down and.

362
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,480
>> Right.
>> Removing that

363
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,140
stressful feeling and state.

364
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,940
So, what is this concept of coherence,
physiological coherence,

365
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,570
how is that different than relaxation.

366
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,960
>> Great question.

367
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,510
So obviously, relaxation is an important
skill to have.

368
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,320
You know if it's time to relax, it's time
to relax.

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,628
You don't want the autonomic shifts to
occur that are associated with relaxation.

370
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:49,350
However, I'll have to say one of

371
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,360
the myths about relaxation is that it
increases performance.

372
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,070
That's true if you're at a high anxiety
state and getting ready to take a test or

373
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,380
something, sure.

374
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,570
But if let's say you are a police officer
or EMT, the last thing I

375
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,350
want you to do is be overly relaxed if I'm
the one hurting you're walking up right.

376
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,190
Like wow man maybe we should go over there
and see if he's bleeding or not right?

377
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,760
But I want you, I do want your heart rate
up.

378
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,730
I want you ready to take care of business
but

379
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,140
I want you to be composed and coherent.

380
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,580
So you can use coherence, once you learn
the skills to shift into a coherent state

381
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,500
to help you relax, chill out, increase
parasympathetic function and all that.

382
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,750
But you can also shift into a coherent
state And

383
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,250
coherence equals composure, right?

384
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,050
And improved cognitive functions with very
high heart rates.

385
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,750
So we, I, you may not know this, but we
developed the Resilience Program for

386
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,970
the Navy and all of the Army's advanced
performance centers use our,

387
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,110
our techniques and technologies.

388
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,150
And with training they're able to get
these individuals, and

389
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,620
it takes some practice, it's not day one,

390
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,450
to be in a coherent state, with heart
rates up over 120.

391
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,760
So it gets the pattern of the variability
here which reflect in our

392
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,650
degree of inners, increa,
inner-synchronization.

393
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,170
So, I hope that is an answer.

394
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,390
So it's, so coherence does not equal
relaxation per se.

395
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,280
>> Mm-hm, there seems to be some overlap,
but they are,

396
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,370
they are distinct from one another.

397
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,050
>> Oh absolutely.

398
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,190
Physiologically, they're very distinct now
at the same time you can be in a quote

399
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,710
relaxed state, low heart rate, increased
paracine [UNKNOWN] and all that right?

400
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,360
And have a very incoherent heart rhythm.

401
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,040
Be very out of sync.

402
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,140
And that's typically, not, again, not that
you would ever done this,

403
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,700
the end of the day, we're a beautiful part
of the world here, right?

404
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,070
You know, looking at a great, scene in
naturey,

405
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,980
or, in nature, overlooking, Pacific Ocean
here.

406
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,380
And, sitting there, maybe rehashing that
disagreement you had earlier in the day,

407
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,120
or a meeting that didn't go right.

408
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,870
God, I can't believe they said so and so
and next time I'll say such and

409
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,370
such, and, you know what I'm talking
about.

410
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,920
>> Mm-hm.

411
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,220
>> So you're relaxed physiologically
speaking, but

412
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,650
you're still incoherent, and that's still
an inefficient state.

413
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,710
You're still burning a lot of energy,
right down to the metabolic and

414
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,680
then we're starting to see now even
genetic effect level.

415
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,690
From that state even though you're
relaxed.

416
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,170
>> That's really, really interesting
stuff.

417
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,740
So, so then now we transition in talking
about science and applying the science.

418
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,770
And Heart Math is at a really fascinating,
sort of locust or

419
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,890
convergence between science and creating
these practical tools.

420
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,040
>> Mm hm.
>> So

421
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,530
from your perspective what are some of the
limitations and

422
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,750
challenges of trying to draw in what is
often the limited understand in science?

423
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,520
And then translating that into something
that can make our lives better.

424
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,750
>> Any time there's any new discovery,
there's always disagreement and

425
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,500
different interpretations.

426
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,440
I mean that's still going on in quantum
physics, for

427
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,890
example, a lot of interpretations and, and
so on.

428
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,220
So that's to be expected.

429
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,370
the, I think for the real part of your
question is how do

430
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,550
you turn science in something useful to
help people?

431
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,193
>> Mm-hm.

432
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:58,220
>> First of all, I think you have to have
the intent to do that.

433
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,376
To really be honest, I mean a lot of
science, I mean we could do basic

434
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:08,570
research and just keep doing that and
never care about if it got applied or not.

435
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,558
We have a different mission and intent,
which is really to help humanity so

436
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,190
when we, for example, I was talking about
when we discovered coherence,

437
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,818
that became very simple in a way.

438
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:22,090
I mean I don't want to make this sound
over simple but,

439
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,980
but, okay we've identified an optimal
physiological states.

440
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,910
How do we help people, self activate or
shift into that state?

441
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,350
Especially when they're in challenging
times.

442
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,910
So then that became another research
topic.

443
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,780
In developing tools,

444
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,510
techniques and then later technologies, to
help people do that.

445
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,610
I hope I'm answering your question near
enough.

446
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,115
Of course we do a lot of studies and
research that don't work.

447
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:51,060
[LAUGH] I mean, you know, we've paid our
dues here.

448
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,620
Often times, some of our studies have
worked really well.

449
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,570
Better than, I couldn't have, if I'd have
wrote down what I hoped the outcomes would

450
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,750
be before we start the study, I would've,
you know, limited the study.

451
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,560
I mean, even better outcomes, sometimes
too, so.

452
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
>> Yeah, absolutely.

453
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,610
>> I don't know if I answered your
question.

454
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,180
>> No, you are, you are addressing it.

455
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,270
It's trying, well I'm trying to articulate
is it seems to me like, of,

456
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,990
people will be very interested in what it
is that you, you guys are doing which is

457
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,210
applying science which is very different
than basic science research and how.

458
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,890
What are some of the challenges associated
with that?

459
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,340
>> Well, hah.

460
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,400
Well one of the biggest challenges depends
on the field we're talking to

461
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,190
actually as well.

462
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,110
Would be the idea that the heart the
activity of the heart affects the brain.

463
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,070
You know, I can't be, right?

464
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,100
So it's peoples' mindsets, and what
they've been taught.

465
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,920
Their histories, and

466
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,210
a lot of people have a lot invested in
what they've learned, right?

467
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,930
So if you're coming up with something new
or different than what they've learned,

468
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,637
that's challenging.

469
00:24:55,637 --> 00:25:00,240
And, so the, I mean theres been a few
critics over the years.

470
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,140
But almost all of them have been people
who didn't bother to actually read any of

471
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,040
our research papers.

472
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,720
Just hear, you know, somebody says well
the heart fixed the brain for example.

473
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,760
Can't be, nonsense, right?

474
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,060
But they would bother to actually read our
work and

475
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,920
the vast literature that preceded it they
would be.

476
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,410
Well, they wouldn't be saying that.

477
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,890
I mean, the fact that the heart for

478
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,370
example, here's one that, still people
when they first hear it,

479
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,990
a lot of, a lot of the time don't believe
it, or just write things off.

480
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,440
And that is that the heart sends more
information to the brain than

481
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,540
the brain sends to the heart.

482
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,400
Absolute fact.

483
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,440
Been known since the late 1800s.

484
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,720
In fact, it was a, a key theory in early
psychology, right?

485
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,350
Up until the 1930s or so.

486
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,509
I mean it's anatomy but still when, that's
not currently taught in medical school or

487
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:57,490
probably a lot of psychology, in the
classes and so on.

488
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,950
So, people who haven't heard that, it's
wow I can't be.

489
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,540
>> So, who are some of these critics?

490
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,330
Where do they come from?

491
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,340
>> Well it, when they first hear that well
let's say

492
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,620
that the group that actually really gets
it pretty quickly is cardiologists.

493
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,529
They no problem at all with that
statement.

494
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,260
Often times, cause they know about the
afrin system and

495
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,100
all that and pain and that type of thing.

496
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:28,090
it, it can be academics especially in
psychology and

497
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,030
it actually surprises me sometimes in
talking to clinical psychologists and

498
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,089
stuff how little physiology training
they've had.

499
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:39,570
I mean I've literally had to explain how a
Neuron works to some physiologists

500
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,130
over the years.

501
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,640
The general public in general doesn't have
any problem with that.

502
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,570
Right?

503
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,000
>> Because it's coming from this intuitive
place [CROSSTALK]

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,520
>> Well, they all,

505
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,620
yeah, I mean I'll, I'll be honest Cory
though.

506
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,910
Probably the most common thing i hear from
the general public about our work and

507
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,810
our research is, God thank you.

508
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,720
You've actually confirmed something that
I've intuitively believed or

509
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
knew to be true all along.

510
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,490
So, it's really, thank you for showing
this.

511
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,730
I have more confidence in it now.

512
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,450
And actually go apply this stuff in my
life.

513
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,940
I don't know if I answered your question
or not yet.

514
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,080
>> No you absolutely have, thank you.

515
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,410
So moving away from sort of,

516
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,560
the science and the tools now and looking
more towards the future.

517
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,090
So, if you were to imagine, five, ten,
maybe 15 years from now,

518
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,870
what you might expect we have to look
forward to in this field of

519
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,280
the development of these stress
intervention tools.

520
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,720
>> Sure.
>> What do you think is in store of us?

521
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,328
>> A much deeper understanding of the role
of emotions.

522
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:44,390
I mean I, I really do mean that it's the
next frontier.

523
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,790
Once we understand that what most of us
knew when we were talking about stress.

524
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,780
And I'm not talking about the sort of
physiological stress of

525
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,720
being in extreme temperature, and things
like that.

526
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,080
But just what people's lives, when they're
talking stress, it's,

527
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,990
it really is emotion.

528
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,550
And, most people have never been taught
or, or

529
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,550
don't understand that that's something we
can self regulate.

530
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,140
We can choose our emotion diet.

531
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:13,410
In it, the biggest factor in health, in
our health care costs and people health

532
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,305
and well being is, is the lack of being
able to self regulate their emotions.

533
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:18,910
I-E stress.

534
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,110
So it's, it's really in the next frontier.

535
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,410
I mean especially kids.

536
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,090
They, they love the, our stuff.

537
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,160
And being taught at you see, they take to
it very quickly.

538
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,720
And what a, what a great gift to give a
kid, to be able to self-regulate.

539
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,320
And to be able to avoid a lot of the stuff
you have to unlearn later.

540
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,430
>> The problems we created for ourselves
in adulthood.

541
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,000
>> This is actually an area, if you kind
of relate it to your earlier question,

542
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,820
that science hasn't really been that
helpful in some cases.

543
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,480
There are still authors out there talking
about emotions like they're

544
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,840
almost a literal quote.

545
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,540
Emotions are something that just happen to
us, we have no control over them.

546
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,570
Nonsense.

547
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,595
Maybe if you're a rat.

548
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:59,320
[LAUGH] which, while these people are
studying, that's true.

549
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,240
But, no, we have great self regulatory
capacity, as humans.

550
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,130
You know, we have more, as you would well
know as in your field,

551
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,330
more responses than fight or flight, or
freeze.

552
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,078
We have the ability to self regulate,
socially engage, work out our problems.

553
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:21,019
So that's to me the.

554
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,267
>> Emotions are the next frontier.

555
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:22,939
>> Emotions are the next.

556
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:26,508
Understanding emotions, what they really
are and

557
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:32,400
the impact that they really have on, not
just physiology but socially I mean,.

558
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,750
>> So, also looking towards the future a
little bit.

559
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,750
If a, a student, many of our members of
our audience are, are students.

560
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,705
>> Mm-hm.

561
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:47,010
>> And many of whom might be interested in
becoming involved in study of stress or

562
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,060
the development of related tools.

563
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,610
So if one of them were to come to you,
asking for advice.

564
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,403
>> Mm-hm.

565
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:53,640
>> What would, what advice would you give
them?

566
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,610
>> You mean to go into that field?

567
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,145
>> Mm-hm.

568
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:57,100
>> Well, certainly, you're going to need a
background in physiology.

569
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,160
And probably psychology.

570
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,340
And there's actually a field that I'm, my
PhD's in, is psychophysiology.

571
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,720
A kind of combination of the two.

572
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,490
I don't know if you have a program, a
psychophysiology program here or not.

573
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,990
But, but if not Psychology and physiology,
but also it wouldn't

574
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,980
hurt to get some biomedical engineering
programs in there as well.

575
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,330
It is technology driven and that's when
things are rapidly changing is

576
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,170
when people's ability to self monitor from
a technology perspective.

577
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,330
Help provide feedback Monitoring of what's
going on in our body.

578
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,300
Which helps us, helps educate and motivate
people as well.

579
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,316
>> So, you would say, so, get in,

580
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:44,150
get understanding of psychology,
physiology and Biomedical engineering.

581
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,950
>> Biomedical engineering.

582
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,330
Excellent.

583
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,850
So, then, that leads us to one of our last
questions today.

584
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,630
Which is.

585
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,920
What's the, what's the take home message?

586
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,720
If you could leave one sort of soundbite
or

587
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,480
idea with the audience that really
reflects what's most important about your

588
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,780
message today what is that take home
message?

589
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,610
>> Well for yourself learn and

590
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,820
practice, being more self-aware of our
emotions and what's going on.

591
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,710
And learning how to self-regulate, be in
charge of ourselves.

592
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,630
Make better choices in our emotional diet.

593
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,860
>> Excellent, excellent.

594
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,250
Well then that, concludes our interview
today.

595
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,320
Thank you so much for being with us today
Dr. McCraty.

596
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,680
>> My pleasure.
>> It was a real pleasure.

597
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,280
>> Yeah, likewise.

598
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,080
Thank you.

599
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:49,080
So.
