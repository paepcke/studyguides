1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,900
I'm a bit sad because we've come to the
last of the sections.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,280
I'm also really proud of you for making it
all the way to the end.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,110
It's not easy to complete an online course
and you're almost done it.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,610
Way to go!

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,385
This week we will be talking about
variable pressure environments,

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:21,680
g-forces, diving, and the microgravity of
outer space.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,490
Except for maybe scuba diving, not a lot
of you out there have

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,750
probably experienced the environments that
we'll be talking about.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,060
Raise your hand, how many of you have
flown a fighter plane?

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:31,880
Okay.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,230
Not so many out there.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,800
But in some ways, that's what makes this
section so cool.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,358
It's unique.

14
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,590
Microgravity, I mean,

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,790
how many of you wanted to be an astronaut
when you were a kid?

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,460
Despite having three different topics,
this section will be our shortest of all.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,120
After all, unlike aging, stress, or
altitude, there are no whole lot of

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,020
practical tips I can give you for when you
happen to be in outer space.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,460
But the physiology is still fascinating.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,360
And who knows, maybe someday, Mars will
just be a commuter flight away for

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,770
some of you younger folks out there.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,090
That reminds me.

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,420
When I visited NASA in Mountain View to do
a little consulting work,

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,630
I walked by a door to a room that said,
Mars exercise physiology lab.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,630
Wow.
I don't know

26
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,400
what was going on behind that door, but I
bet it was really interesting.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,380
I think I want that to be my next business
card.

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,480
Anne Friedlander, Mars Exercise
Physiologist.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,720
What do you think?

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,150
To my right is the outline for this
section.

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,790
You've already seen our vomiting
adventures in the skies, so

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,700
we'll start off by talking about how your
body deals with G-forces.

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,810
Then we'll move onto modules about diving,
and then onto space, the final frontier.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,505
To boldly go where no man has gone before.

35
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,840
[LAUGH] Okay.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,920
I think I just dated myself, but I've
looked at the age demographics for this

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,220
class, and more than half of you should
knew, should know what that comes from.

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,580
Yes?

39
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,930
Anyhow, we didn't have quite enough
funding to send Corey into space for

40
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,360
this project, but fortunately, Radio Lab,

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,900
my favorite radio show, did a great
episode called The Dark Side of the Earth,

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,490
that tells a thrilling story of what it's
like to be in space.

43
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,250
We've provided that link so you can listen
on your computer or

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,470
even better, download it onto your phone
and listen to it while you go for a walk.

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,200
Then come back to Module 5, we will
explain the physiology of space.

46
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,670
We had a lot of fun filming the story for
this section.

47
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,240
As you saw from the video, some of us had
a bit more fun than others.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,400
Let's put it this way.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,560
You didn't see me getting out of the plane
saying,

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,185
that was probably the coolest thing I've
ever done.

51
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:39,830
[LAUGH] But it was a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, I hope, and

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,640
really fascinating.

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,100
Even if you have never flown,

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,180
you may actually experience G-forces more
often than you think.

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,920
Let's take a look.

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,010
The force of gravity will pull on a free
falling object causing it

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,600
to accelerate towards earth at 32 feet per
second.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,490
If we move quickly in a particular
direction we can create our

59
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,790
own acceleration that can be quantified in
multiples of gravity, or G-forces.

60
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,770
The arrows on the man to my right
represent the direction of forces felt, so

61
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,840
the opposite that the person is moving.

62
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,150
If we go up rapidly, then the additional
force pulling down on us adds to

63
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,850
gravity and its called positive G-forces,
depicted as the plus Gz on the man.

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,010
Because of the aerodynamics in a plane,

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,450
pilots experience positive G-forces not
only when they accelerate upward, but

66
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,800
also when making a sharp turn because the
plane tips to its side.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,340
It's sort of like putting water in a
bucket and spinning it around.

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,950
The centripetal acceleration holds the
water in

69
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,850
the bucket just like that same force
pushes down on the pilot into the seat.

70
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,330
If you experience twice the acceleration
of gravity, you're pulling 2Gs.

71
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,770
3 times, 3 Gs, etc.

72
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,520
If you were to dive down suddenly in a
plane,

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,890
then the force is subtracted off gravity,
and it's called a negative G.

74
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,060
You can also have side to side G-forces,
like when you go around

75
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,480
a corner quickly in a car on a non-banked
road, or forward and back, acceleration.

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,880
The Gx to my right, Like when taking off
in a plane or

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,420
testing your 0 to 60 acceleration in your
new Toyota Camry.

78
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,170
The main problem we face with G-force is
that the Gs force blood into parts of our

79
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,980
body away from the direction of movement.

80
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,220
We'll talk more about the implications of
that blood movement a bit later.

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,970
Before we had airplanes, there was nothing
that could accelerate the human body fast

82
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,310
enough to create the feeling of G-forces,
so it wasn't until World War One,

83
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,120
when pilots started mysteriously fainting
in the air,

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,349
that doctors started investigating the
phenomenon.

85
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,930
As planes got faster and started changing
directions more rapidly in the air,

86
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,570
things started getting worse for the
pilots.

87
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,300
People started talking about the G-force
phenomenon and

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,220
it was estimated that humans could
withstand a maximum of

89
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,630
18 Gs because that was air force pilots
seemed to be able to survive in a crash.

90
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,790
It was also the force that the cockpit was
designed to withstand upon impact.

91
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,280
In the mid 1940's, an Air Force physician
named John Stapp began to suspect that

92
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,000
maybe it wasn't the G-forces that was
killing the pilots in the crash, but

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,120
the crushing of the cockpit.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,050
So he set out to understand the physiology
of G-forces hoping to

95
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,540
improve cockpit safety.

96
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,470
He started strapping dummies into
self-built rocket powered, a self-built

97
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,240
rocket powered sled called the Gee Whiz,
that was capable of accelerating along

98
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,120
a track very rapidly and then coming up to
a ridiculously abrupt stop.

99
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,200
Eventually, the dummies weren't good
enough and

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,429
he started strapping himself into the
sled.

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,220
As explained in a Nova article by Peter
Tyson, quote, by the late summer of

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,650
1948 Stapp had done 16 runs himself and
withstood up to 35 Gs.

103
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,810
He lost dental fillings, cracked a few
ribs and

104
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,720
twice broke a wrist, but he survived.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,980
But that wasn't good enough for Stapp.

106
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,760
He decided that he really needed to know
what pilots would

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,580
experience when they ejected at high
speeds.

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,450
So he built an even faster sled, the Sonic
Wind.

109
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,470
In his article, Tyson goes on to give a
description of

110
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,990
Stapp's final run in December of 1954 in
the Sonic Wind.

111
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,140
He says quote, Sap deci,

112
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,710
Stap decided to pull out all the stops,
firing nine solid fuel rockets.

113
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,570
His sled accelerated to 632 miles per
hours in five seconds,

114
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,390
slamming him into two tons of wind
pressure.

115
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,960
Then came to a stop in just over one
second.

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,390
A witness said it was absolutely
inconceivable anyone could

117
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,600
go that fast then just stop and survive,
but Stapp did.

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,580
He was just barely conscious.

119
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,400
The jolt burst nearly ev, nearly every
capillary in his eyeballs.

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,590
He was blinded, but his retinas did not
detach.

121
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,820
He slowly regained his bearings.

122
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,230
And within a day, his vision was back to
normal.

123
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,870
During that final run, he experienced a
record breaking 46.2 Gs.

124
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,956
For an instant, his 168 pound body had
weighed over 7,700 pounds.

125
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:23,465
Now that is dedication to science.

126
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,710
I don't think we're going to take Corey
quite that far.

127
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,090
A link to the Nova article where I got
some of this story is in

128
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,369
the resource section at the end.

129
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,430
Sometimes we handle G-forces better than
others.

130
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,350
Let's look at why.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,920
As we said a couple of slides ago,
G-forces are related to acceleration, so

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,740
change in speed, not speed itself.

133
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,620
That's why you feel like you're being
pressed back into the seat when you

134
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,600
accelerate onto the freeway, but

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,858
not when you're cruising along steadily at
65 miles an hour.

136
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:59,088
Also, how g-forces affect your body is
dependent on

137
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:04,609
the magnitude of acceleration, the
duration, and the direction.

138
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,420
Magnitude is obvious.

139
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,940
The more the acceleration, the more you
feel on your body.

140
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,570
But duration is key as well.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,690
Plop down in a chair, it can be up to 10
Gs.

142
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,550
A cough can be up to 3.5 Gs.

143
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,870
A firm slap on the back can be 4 Gs.

144
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,730
Also, think about how much Stapp could
survive for

145
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,680
an instant, greater than 46 Gs.

146
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,680
But he'd never be able to handle that,
close to that, much, for sustained time.

147
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,880
You NASCAR fans out there probably know
that NASCAR drivers sus,

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,390
sustain two to three Gs around the corners
of the racetrack.

149
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,610
That isn't that much for a couple turns,
but

150
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,950
it's very physically demanding during a
three to five hour race.

151
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,610
Your body has to do a lot of work to
constantly fight that pressure and

152
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,390
keep the blood going up to your head and
not pooling in the lower extremities.

153
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,110
So whether you think NASCAR is a sport or
not, it does require physical fitness.

154
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,680
And then there's direction.

155
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,590
Forward and back, or horizontal, is not as
hard on us as up and

156
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,930
down direction, that can create major
blood flow and pressure issues.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,050
There's a roller coaster in South Africa
that claims to

158
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,700
give riders a 6.3G experience.

159
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,050
Riders can tolerate that because it is in
the forward direction, and is only for

160
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,759
a couple of seconds.

161
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,940
There's a link to the resources that shows
you that roller coaster as well.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,160
And what do you think is harder for us to
sane, sustain?

163
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,970
Going up quickly, so positive Gs.

164
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,060
Or, down quickly, negative Gs.

165
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,810
Negative Gs are harder.

166
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,730
We're used to walking upright and

167
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,700
fighting the affects of gravity on blood
flow anyway.

168
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,100
So we have some mechanisms like tightening
up our vessels, or

169
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,000
clamping down our muscles that help get
blood back up to our hearts and brains.

170
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,150
On the other hand,

171
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,250
we don't usually deal with a problem of
too much blood rushing to our heads.

172
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,010
There's not a lot physiologically that we
can do about it.

173
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,790
That's why we get so red faced and

174
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,180
puffy when we hang upside down on the
jungle gym.

175
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,110
So what are the tolerable limits for
sustained G-forces in humans?

176
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Depends on a number of factors, but a
normal person is thought to be able to

177
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,150
tolerate between four and five positive Gs
and two to three negative Gs.

178
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,830
Fighter pilots both because they are
preselected to be able to

179
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,220
sustain high G's and because they train to
get used to them,

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,990
can sustain eight to nine in the positive
direction but

181
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,240
again only about two to three in the
negative direction.

182
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,179
We just don't have a lot of tolerance for
blood rushing into our heads.

183
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,450
With G-suits pilots can still get to about
eight or

184
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,600
nine but they can sustain them for longer.

185
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,490
A G-suit pictured on this handsome young,
yet small,

186
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,010
man to my right, [LAUGH] pressurizes the
lower body to

187
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,390
keep blood from pooling away from the
brain when the G-valve is activated.

188
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,679
So the suit senses some change in
G-forces.

189
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:14,350
The suit is easier, but not quite as
effective as maintain the butt clinch or

190
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,900
G strain maneuver that you saw instructor
Jad Dennis talk about in the story video.

191
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,730
For the G strain you tighten down your
lower body and compress your diaphragm

192
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,890
against a closed globus to increase blood
pressure and volume in your core.

193
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,570
Which, by the way, is something that I
completely forgot to do as I was trying to

194
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,750
figure out how to fly the plane.

195
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,290
And we know what happened to me sadly.

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,470
For training, physical fitness is
important in order to

197
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,350
withstand the repeated pressures that are
put upon pilots.

198
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,410
Weight training of the lower body and core
that increases the forces that pilots can,

199
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,520
pilots can develop when needed for the G
strain, or hook maneuver, is critical.

200
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,950
With regular exposure, pilots have some
circulatory and

201
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,610
heart changes that allow them to maintain
blood pressure, and

202
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,660
the G strain maneuver just becomes
automatic for them.

203
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,770
With the G suit, good hook maneuver, and
regular flying,

204
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,059
a high-end pilot can maintain nine Gs for
around 30 seconds before passing out.

205
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,480
By the way, here's a little factoid for
you.

206
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,600
The famous Blue Angel Navy pilots
regularly pull high Gs, but

207
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,170
they can't wear G-suits because they
stabilize their flying arms on their legs.

208
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,370
Their flying maneuvers are so tight,

209
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,070
within 18 inches of each other's planes,
that they

210
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,540
can't risk the suit automatically
inflating to counter a G-force, and

211
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,700
thus moving their arms at all, which could
cause them to clip the next plane over.

212
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,940
It's amazing precision.

213
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,783
Now the challenges of G-forces.

214
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,440
First on the list, tunnel vision and grey
out.

215
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,890
Blood flow to the eyes ceases before blood
flow to the brain, so

216
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,750
your vision gets affected as an early
warning sign.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,040
Vision is lost from the outside in because
the peripheral vision is weaker in

218
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,410
humans with the greatest number of photo
receptors in the center and

219
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,569
lowest on the edge.

220
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,500
A grey out occurs when a person is on the
verge of fainting.

221
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,640
Vision fades and light and color reduce to
a gray washed-out blur.

222
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,980
There'll often be a loss of peripheral
vision and

223
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,855
a sort of tunnel effect, which is caused
by a drop in blood pressure to the brain.

224
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:34,890
G-LOC, or

225
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,710
G Loss of Consciousness, is the next step
as more blood drains from the head.

226
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,390
Basically, there's not enough oxygen to
sustain metabolism of the brain.

227
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,700
Normally, if you're on the ground and you
faint, it causes you to fall over,

228
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,030
thus getting more blood and oxygen back up
to your brain.

229
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,655
It's a bit more problematic if you're
flying an F-16 at 1,500 miles per hour, or

230
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,010
2,400 kilometers per hour.

231
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:12,240
Next is the wobblies, G-induced vestibular
dysfunction, GIVD, which results

232
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,300
from force migration of crystals into the
posterior semicircular canal of the ear.

233
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,340
It gives a false sense of angular motion
which leads to dizziness, nausea, and

234
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,869
swir, a swirling sensation.

235
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,650
Do you remember when Corey first got out
of the plane?

236
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,580
He was wobbling all over the place,

237
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,790
because he had done some seriously radical
maneuvers up in the air.

238
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,490
It took about five or ten minutes to
recover from that.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,015
Nausea can come from the wobblies, and

240
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,020
Corey did almost get sick as we were
walking back to the airport.

241
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,450
But for those of you who got, get motion
sickness, you know that nausea can also

242
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,970
come from a disconnect between what your
eyes are seeing and your ears are feeling.

243
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,390
Some researchers believe that the throwing
up response is because that sort of

244
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,170
disconnect and confusion in the brain,
before we had cars and trains and

245
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,420
planes, used to be associated with eating
a toxin.

246
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,580
So your body is trying to purge you of
that toxin.

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,430
You also can experience nausea when
recovering from G-LOC or

248
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,950
even when blood drains temporarily from
your head.

249
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,740
If any of you have fainted, you know that
nausea frequently follows.

250
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,840
Your brain does not like to be without
blood flow.

251
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay, but here's the question.

252
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,330
Why does motion sickness get worse with
age?

253
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:35,860
Or does it?

254
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,900
I have lots of friends who used to love
roller coasters and

255
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,990
now can't ride them with their kids
without hurling.

256
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,119
I've seen TV episodes depicting this
dilemma for parents.

257
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,840
I used to be a maniac when it came to
rides at the county fair, and

258
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,190
yet I vomited in the plane for this story
video.

259
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,800
So what is it?

260
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Some people theorize that as we get older,

261
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,430
fluid in the ears get thicker, so crystal
stick out of place more.

262
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,390
Maybe it's just that we are not used to
throwing ourselves around as much, so

263
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,410
we get out of practice.

264
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,540
Clearly our pilots from our Air Force
combat adventure were no

265
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,470
spring chickens and they weren't having
any trouble at all, but they still fly for

266
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,770
a living so they're used to it.

267
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,270
Anyway, I looked, but haven't found a
satisfactory answer.

268
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,720
So, if any of you bright people out there
have an idea about aging and

269
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,659
motion sickness, I'd love to hear it.

270
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,770
Moving on.

271
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,470
Retinal damage can be caused by the
rupture of delicate vessels in

272
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,480
the eye with sudden backward motion.

273
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,620
This can lead to red-out, which is a
dangerous condition that

274
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,179
results from too much blood pressure in
the head and eyes.

275
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,880
Whereas positive G induced grey out or
blackout is usually only temporary,

276
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,460
negative G induced red-outs are especially
dangerous because they

277
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,490
can cause retinal damage and maybe a
precursor to hemorrhagic stroke.

278
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,370
The theory is that the red in the visual
field occurs not as a result of

279
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,400
blood flow to the eye, but as a result of
the blood filled lower eyelid being

280
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,250
pulled into the visual field as a result
of the negative Gs.

281
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,929
Last on the slide, long term effects.

282
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,930
The long term effects aren't too bad.

283
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,210
They include most commonly neck pain from
the constant strain and

284
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,050
pressure on the neck.

285
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,620
Also many pilots report bruxism, which is
grinding the teeth and clenching the jaw.

286
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,170
On the good side, there also may be a
beneficial outcome on bone density,

287
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,590
because of all that increased spinal
loading, with the high G-forces.

288
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,880
A 2001 study found that Australian fighter
pilots who routinely felt forces of

289
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,880
between two and six Gs experienced an 11%
increase in

290
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,150
bone mineral content of their spines over
the course of their training year.

291
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay, that's it for this module.

292
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,090
If you want to see some pilots go through
their G-force training check out

293
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,820
the short video that I've inserted in the
resources.

294
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,190
It illustrates these concepts well
including the vomiting and

295
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,840
is fun to watch.

296
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,060
Next up, scuba and free diving, excellent.
