2
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:14,388
>> So, Dr. McCraty, could you teach me one
of the techniques that you use?

3
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:14,940
>> Sure.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,149
Let's also facilitate it with some
technology that measures your heart rate

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,290
ability or more specifically, the
coherence in your heart rhythm.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,044
So, I have a iphone here, a little sensor
plugged in.

7
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:26,990
>> Okay.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,160
>> These are pulse sensors, so I'd like
you to put that on your ear lobe.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,260
Not here up top.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,160
In the fleshy part, because we have to get
a pulse.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,470
>> How's that look?

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,000
>> That looks like that should work.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,770
So to start this particularly device,

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,610
you just tap on the screen and we'll
bypass that.

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,350
So now we're seeing your pulse here on the
screen.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,780
And then that's going to quickly, we show
the pulse so

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,540
we can make sure you're getting a good
recording, you got a good hookup because

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,690
we're measuring the time between each
heartbeat and that's being plotted.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,320
Now here's your heart rhythm or your heart
[UNKNOWN].

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,940
So in this screen, we have a mandala here
that is a breathing pacer, and

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,850
if you follow the breathing pacer, you
know, breathe with it,

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,960
that helps start the process of shifting
you into a coherent state.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,260
It's, again it's that optimal state where
improved cognitive functioning as well as

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,800
sensory motor integration and so on.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,700
And then it's giving you feedback here
whether you're in high,

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,910
low or being in coherence, whether low is
red, medium coherence is the blue dots,

27
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,240
and green is high coherence which you have
not hit yet.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,210
So I'm going to shift to another slide,
another screen view here, so

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,800
we actually get to see your heart
variability.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,380
The pattern of it.

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,690
And what we're looking for here is rather
than this kind of incoherent looking

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,950
pattern, this jagged looking pattern,

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,370
as you practice one of the techniques that
it becomes more sine wave like.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,810
So, and here we have a breathing pacer as
well.

35
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,400
And this graph here is going to show us
how coherent you are over time.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,850
See here now you're in red.

37
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,120
We haven't used the technique yet.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,065
So, I'm going to walk you through a
technique called Freeze Frame, Cory.

39
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:07,560
>> Okay.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,750
>> And this is really a technique that's
appropriate for, it's multipurpose, but

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,380
for especially if you have to make a
decision.

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,690
Or you don't quite know the answer or

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,040
you need some out of box solutions for
something.

44
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,240
Or you can also use it just to freeze the
frame.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,580
Like if you're getting stressed, you know,
getting ready to get anxious or angry, or

46
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,340
before you take a test.

47
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,780
Something like that, for sure.

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,680
Anyway, the way you do the technique is
the first step we

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,450
call heart focus breathing.

50
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,200
So that's where you put your attention in
the center of your chest.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,740
You pretend like you're breathing right
through the center of your chest.

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,530
Now I know that you're really breathing
through your nose and

53
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,960
mouth but you, but your attention here and
almost pretend like you

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,210
can feel the breath coming right in
through the center of the chest.

55
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,300
And breathe in about 5 seconds, 4-5
seconds.

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,010
It's not an overly deep or exaggerated
breath.

57
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,340
Breathe out, the same rhythm, 4 or 5
seconds.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,620
Just, you know, do that.

59
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,970
And you, you don't have to have your eyes
closed.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,810
You can, that's one of the beauties of
these techniques, you can do it

61
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,349
right while you're diving, or in a staff
meeting, or right in the moment.

62
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,040
So you can, if you need a breathing pacer,
you can use that.

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,120
Now what that's starting to do is that's
actually using the physiology to

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,770
help get the system more coherent from
what we're talking about earlier.

65
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,030
Now to really take you to the next level
of coherence and sustain that,

66
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,110
that requires, or it certainly helps if we
can add a positive feeling.

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't mean, I'm not talking about
thinking something.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,180
'Kay.

69
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,350
It's really feeling something.

70
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,340
When you're first learning this, how do
you activate a positive feeling?

71
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,760
Right?
Sometimes you might have to visualize,

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,900
you know a, what it feels like when you're
in a special place in nature or

73
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,500
that you really, that really evokes that
feeling.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,260
Or it can be the feeling that you have
when your pet greets you at home.

75
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,080
Right, or if you're a teenager, it might
be the feeling you

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,500
have when you get a really good deal at
the mall, you know.

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,580
It doesn't matter.

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,920
It's that positive feeling.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,750
So I don't know if you have something that
you can do to, or

80
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,890
it can be simply, god what a beautiful day
it is.

81
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,940
>> Mm.
>> I appreciate that.

82
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,290
You know, it's just kind of a nice day.

83
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,560
So while you're doing the breathing just
sort of pretend almost like you're

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,186
breathing the feeling.

85
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,100
[MUSIC]

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,890
Okay and what we see happening here is you
just went into

87
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,370
a much higher state of coherence.

88
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,700
Big shift.

89
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,140
See the pattern in the rhythm here.

90
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,270
You know, freeze frame, once, once you're
into that coherent state,

91
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,480
you've now facilitated a lot of your, your
mental and cognitive functions.

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,340
So then you can, can simply just ask
yourself, you know, what would be a better

93
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,850
choice in this situation, and you would
assume that this is, you're trying to make

94
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,620
a decision, or it's a social situation,
what would be a better response.

95
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,330
[MUSIC]

96
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,700
>> Then the next step is you kind of have
to be quiet inside and

97
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,670
listen for the answer.

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,430
Now these are abbreviated simple steps but

99
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,730
that is the simple essence of the
[INAUDIBLE] technique.

100
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,650
>> Excellent.

101
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,310
Well that was pretty amazing to watch.

102
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,320
>> Yeah, a huge shift there right, see.

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,220
Now when you see here, you've come back
down from a high coherence to

104
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,450
a medium coherence, as you're talking and
reengaging.

105
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,336
And with practice, what people learn, is
that when you first do it,

106
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:28,350
you kind of gotta be quiet and really try
and get into coherence.

107
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,320
But with a little practice,

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,069
you can actually maintain your coherence
while we're having a conversation.

109
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,390
That's a good way to challenge yourself.

110
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,920
Once it gets easy to be coherent.

111
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,420
The way I recommend you practice this, is
challenging yourself in a different way.

112
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,590
Just doing that, can I maintain that
coherence when I am having a conversation.

113
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,440
Or when I'm on the phone,

114
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,272
especially when I'm on the phone that
somebody that stresses me out.

115
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,390
>> Yeah.
>> Stresses you out.

116
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,980
>> Exactly.

117
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,780
Because that's really what this is about,
is being able to

118
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,950
take these techniques into the real world
in maintaining that composure and

119
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,750
that ability to stay cognitively
facilitated rather than inhibited, right?

120
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,980
>> Right.

121
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,880
>> So it's not about walkin' around with
this thing.

122
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
>> Mm-hm.
>> You know?

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,220
Am I coherent?

124
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,835
Am I coherent?

125
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:13,090
>> [LAUGH] But it'a a wonderful tool to,
when you use these techniques,

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,270
am I getting that physiological shift that
underlies those cognitive abilities.

127
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,240
And really my message is pretty simple
right.

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,370
You have all these centers in our nervous
system and

129
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,550
brain that underlie our cognitive skills.

130
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,450
If they're disordered, how can we expect
them to function properly or optimally?

131
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,530
So it's really about getting our self in
sync and

132
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,680
optimizing the very functions that we need
to utilize especially in today's world.

133
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,690
>> So have you found in your own personal
experience that

134
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,920
the more you've practiced these techniques
that you continue to get better at them?

135
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,020
>> Oh, absolutely.

136
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,650
In fact the real goal and in fact, we call
it creating a base line shift.

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,750
With enough practice, usually about 6
weeks if you're sincere about it,

138
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,850
from using the techniques and technology
to be coherent, you are retraining your

139
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,900
nervous system to where coherence becomes
the new familiar or the new normal.

140
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,620
So you'll be going into a coherent state
just sitting down without even

141
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,440
thinking to use a technique That'd be Dr.
Schumann in a, in a published study.

142
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,940
>> And, and you seem to have found that
the more you practice it,

143
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,530
the less you need these different
biofeedback tools.

144
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,310
You've sort of developed an understanding
of.

145
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,720
>> You develop what it feels like.

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,860
This is helping you know that I'm in that
state,

147
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,530
because it's really easy to fool ourselves
especially when you're first learning.

148
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,910
You feel all coherent and sync, and oh my
god, I'm totally not.

149
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,930
>> I'm in the red!

150
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,250
And I'm having a conversation.

151
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,520
>> So it's a skill, that we learn.

152
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,490
Once it's becomes more familiar,

153
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,160
it's much easier to shift into that state
[UNKNOWN] of life.

154
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,350
Or a stressor.

155
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,110
It's kind of naive to think that we're
going to learn a technique like this and

156
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,970
walk right up into the big stressors and
be able to make that shift.

157
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,450
I mean, it takes some practice.

158
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,310
You have to gain that inner familiarity
with it, a new base line.

159
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,910
>> Slowly developed over time.

160
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,780
>> Yeah.

161
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,210
And you can use it with stronger and
stronger stress instances.

162
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,750
>> Exactly.
>> Just sort of like lifting weights.

163
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,340
>> Well, exactly.

164
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,260
>> You can't just lift once and then go in
and squat 400 lbs.

165
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,630
>> Right, and that we, we talk a lot about
resilience in our work.

166
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,060
So that and we actually talk about
resilience in 4 different primary domains,

167
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,670
physical being one of 'em.

168
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,920
So, from the resilience perspective, that,

169
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,790
that would be reflected in your endurance
right?

170
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,670
Your strength, your physical flexibility.

171
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,500
Right?
And if you want to

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,270
increase your capacity in that domain, how
do you do it?

173
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,440
>> You train.

174
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,660
>> Well, you train, right?

175
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,420
You stretch past your norm a little bit,
and put out that extra energy.

176
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,290
After a few sessions of doing it
hopefully,

177
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,650
you get some recovery in between, right?

178
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,420
Then that's your new norm, that's your new
baseline.

179
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,020
>> And.

180
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,460
>> It works the same way in terms of our
emotional resilience.

181
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,236
So for a lot of people, kind of a really
common one is traffic just drives 'em

182
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:04,010
crazy, stresses them out and getting all
frustrated and impatient, right?

183
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,650
So you take on that.

184
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,030
Say, wait a minute.

185
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,790
Getting all irritated and impatient's not
going to make the traffic move any faster.

186
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,540
I'm going to do something different, this
time.

187
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,100
And you take that one on, and bring that
one into management.

188
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,770
Right?
So you've increased your capacity there,

189
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,640
your self regulatory capacity.

190
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,450
Then you take on the next maybe bigger
thing in life.

191
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,420
And so on.

192
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,190
>> So I'm hearing a lot of the benefits of
learning how to better regulate ourselves

193
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,890
and perform more optimally in our daily
lives where,

194
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,430
what might be some of the costs of turning
a blind eye to your message and

195
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,360
continuing to, to live the same sort of
emotionally disregulated life.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,950
>> Yeah, shorter life span.

197
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,320
Certainly not as happy, and [INAUDIBLE]
for

198
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,580
well being, I think damage relationships.

199
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,100
And, I mean, the list goes on and on.

200
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,772
And if we really are, you know, honest
with ourselves, and

201
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:04,228
take most of the, the major issues in our
society today,

202
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,092
it almost always traces back to a failure
of self regulation.
