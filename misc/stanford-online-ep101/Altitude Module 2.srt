1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,150
Welcome to the Physiology of Altitude
section.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,110
This is one of my personal favorites, both
because I love being in the mountains and

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,050
because I spent several years doing high
altitude physiology research.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,300
So it's near and dear to my heart.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,310
As I mentioned in the introductory video,
there are so many fascinating things that

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,150
happen when our bodies are exposed to low
oxygen environments.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,540
It's amazing how adaptable we really are.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,540
A fun illustration of this concept comes
from the book Into Thin Air,

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,220
by John Krakauer, about the 1996 Everest
expedition where things went

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,410
terribly wrong and many people lost their
lives.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,170
Early on in the book, when the author is
flying in Nepal,

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,400
in the Airbus 300, he describes a moment
of panic.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,690
He looks out the window and

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,590
sees the unmistakable outline of Mount
Everest at eye level with the plane.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,830
The wind is howling off the top creating a
long train of ice crystals.

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,640
His palms suddenly get sweaty because he
realizes that if

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,890
the plane were to depressurize at that
moment he would likely pass out or die.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,950
Yet, in 6 to 8 weeks, he was planning to
be standing on top of that mountain.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,310
Now, he climbed the mountain with
supplemental oxygen, as most people do.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,900
But there are a handful of people who have
been able to climb Mount Everest

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,110
without supplemental oxygen.

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,340
A feat that many people thought was beyond
capability,

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,079
until it was actually accomplished in 1978
by Reinhold Messner.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,300
So through this process of going up a
little and then down a little up a little

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,590
more and back down, our bodies slowly
acclimatize to allow spectacular feats

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,140
of physical performance that push the
limits of human capabilities.

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,970
Among other things this section will
explain how our bodies adapt to

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,369
allow such accomplishments.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,300
So here are a list of questions to ponder
for

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,160
this section as you go through the
material.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,690
First we will address Corey's questions
from the story video.

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,980
How did Corey compensate for the lower O2
availability at attitude?

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,429
What stop Corey at a lower work load
during exercise at altitude.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,010
And did Corey do better or worse than the
predicted change for 10,000 feet?

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,680
We'll also talk about why we care about
altitude research, and

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,020
how we actually study it.

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,810
What are the challenges we face at high
altitude?

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,240
How our bodies adapt over time to high
altitude?

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,050
What are the high altitude illnesses we
need to worry about, and what causes them?

40
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,890
What are the ways to decrease our risk of
illnesses and

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,370
increase performance at altitude?

42
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,390
And, finally, how do we train at altitude
and will it help our performance?

43
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,562
Over to my right is an outline of how the
overall sections is laid out.

44
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:48,380
We will work through the topics that will
help address the questions that you

45
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,470
had on the last slide.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,070
You can also see in Module four, we have a
bonus story video for you.

47
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,640
Corey and I, and the camera crew, went up
to the summit of Pikes Peak to

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,112
illustrate what it was like to start the
acclimatization process at 14,000 feet.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,970
I have to say that it was particularly fun
to watch our

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,320
hypoxic camera crew weaving about trying
to film the video.

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,930
We're going to talk about the challenges
you face at altitude in this module.

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,290
And, believe me there are a lot of them.

53
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,420
High altitude really does provide a
strong, systemic stimulus to the body.

54
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,040
Low O2 availability impacts your heart
rate and blood pressure,

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,270
you have cardiovascular and endocrine
changes, falls in performance, and

56
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,900
you could even experience symptoms of
acute mountain sickness.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,010
But if your an athlete there are good
things that happen to

58
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,310
like increase red blood cells and
hemadocrit.

59
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,070
Before talk, we talk about the details,
let's put all that information in context.

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,040
Why do we even care about high altitude
physiology?

61
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,600
As the slide to my right says,

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,136
35 million people travel per year to
altitude of greater than 8,000 feet.

63
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,440
They do so, do so for

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,400
a variety of reasons that include
recreation, military service, and work.

65
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,170
Populations reside permanently at high
altitudes in the Rocky Mountains of

66
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,800
North and Central America, the Andes of
South America,

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,579
the East African highlands and the Asian
Himalayan plateau.

68
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,010
But what you may not realize is that even
if you have not been to the mountains

69
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,210
recently, you may have experienced a
moderate altitude stimulus simply by

70
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,510
flying in a commercial jet.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,900
You see, it takes a lot of fuel to
pressurize the cabin.

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,160
So as it compromised to save on fuel, they
only pressurize the cabin to between 5 and

73
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,690
8000 feet.

74
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,740
Therefore, on those long, international
flights,

75
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,900
feelings of jet lag may actually be mild
symptoms of acute mountain sickness.

76
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,070
There's also clinical relevance to
studying the body's response to

77
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,020
hypoxic conditions.

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,610
For example, people which chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and

79
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,709
heart disease experience varying degrees
of hypoxia.

80
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,930
Fetal development is also on the list,
because under normal conditions,

81
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,900
developing fetus, in utero, exists in
high, in a hypoxic environment.

82
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,950
Fetal arterial oxygen tension,

83
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,970
is about one quarter of a healthy adult,
so 25 versus 100 tore respectively.

84
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,979
That is equivalent to the blood oxygen of
a person on the summit of Mount Everest.

85
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,990
This work is particularly relevant to
pregnancies in which hypoxia is

86
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,280
exacerbated such as in fetuses or

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,340
women who smoke, have heart or lung
disease, or anemic or malnourished, or

88
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,549
from mothers who engage in strenuous
physical activity or heavy work.

89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,710
Some theorize that we are able to adapt so
effectively to high altitude because we

90
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,730
spent the first nine months of our lives
in a hypoxic environment of the womb.

91
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,430
Also on the list, tumor treatments.

92
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,490
Researchers and physicians are working on
depriving tumors of their blood supplies,

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,109
and thus oxygen and nutrients to prevent
further growth.

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,190
Understanding how our tissues respond to
hypoxic environments is critical to

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,060
such advancements.

96
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,760
And finally because hypoxia is a whole
body stressor it helps us

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,880
understand the integration of the body
systems.

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,210
We apply a stress to the system, see how
it responds and

99
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,989
it gives a stronger understanding of basic
physiology.

100
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,050
So how do we study humans in a high
altitude environment?

101
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,710
There are several ways, first we can use a
high altitude chamber,

102
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,800
like the one you saw in the Corey's Story
video at the start of this section.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,010
The USARIEM chamber we visitied provided a
hypobaric hypoxia stimulus,

104
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,550
meaning it lowers the total pressure in
the chamber to achieve hypoxia.

105
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,910
This type of stimulus is similar to what
happens when you actually travel to

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,430
the mountains.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,570
Studies that are done in these chambers
are both short term,

108
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,040
like the one we did with Corey, and long
term,

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,220
where participants are asked to stay in
the chamber for days or even weeks.

110
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,360
As we mentioned in the story video, one of
the most famous of

111
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,760
these long term studies was Operation
Everest Two, which was conducted in 1985.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,940
This study simulated a climb by eight
volunteers to

113
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,309
the summit of Mount Everest about 29,000
feet over the course of 40 days.

114
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,880
During that time, an international group
of 23 military and civilian scientists

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,310
conducted a series of experiments at
escalating climatization plateaus.

116
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,790
They collected data to determine the
relative importance of

117
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,229
various psychological, physiologic, and
biochemical responses to low oxygen.

118
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,452
Can you imagine volunteering to be trapped
and

119
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:43,500
watched, 24/7, a little metal box for 40
days?

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,530
To this day, it remains one of the
landmark studies in the field,

121
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,260
from which we attained a huge amount of
valuable information.

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,910
Unfortunately, there are not many of this
chambers around.

123
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,330
They're expensive, and complicated to
build, run and

124
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,230
maintain For example, can you envision
what would happen if you

125
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,440
flushed a normal toilet in an altitude
chamber where the plumbing on

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,480
the outside was significantly higher
pressure than the plumbing inside?

127
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Kaplue.

128
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,510
There would be a lot of nasty stuff on the
walls of the chamber.

129
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,039
So many things have to be redesigned
within the chamber.

130
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,540
Hypoxic gas can also be used to mimic
altitude for both research and

131
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,390
training purposes.

132
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,300
The gas can be administered through masks,
tents, cubes, hotels, and

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,210
even horses snouts.

134
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,116
The stimulus in this case is normobaric
hypoxia, meaning the pressure remain,

135
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,960
remains s at ambient levels, but the
environment is

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,630
made hypoxic by reducing the percentage of
oxygen in the air.

137
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,050
Although originally considered as been
equivalent to hypobaric hypoxia, there

138
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,360
are some minor but critical differences
emerging that require further research.

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,039
We'll talk about a couple of these later.

140
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,330
But as you can see from the slide people
use the technology in gyms to train, in

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,930
labs to do research, and in the bedroom to
improve subsequent exercise performance.

142
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,370
And finally there's the real thing.

143
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,100
Now this is the best gig if you can get
it.

144
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Being able to do field work is a fantastic
way to earn a living.

145
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,070
It allows us to study participants in a
more realistic environment and for

146
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,340
longer periods of time.

147
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,860
The picture to my right is a view of Pikes
Peak from the lower part of

148
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,110
the road that goes up to the top.

149
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,140
There is a Usarium Altitude Research
Station at the top where I

150
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,901
have spent several summers studying the
acclimatization process with my

151
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:41,020
co-investigators, the Army Dudes, as we
fondly called them.

152
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,800
You met Chuck and Steve from that group in
the Usarium Chamber story video.

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,385
Later in this section you will get a first
hand view of the research station as

154
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:53,629
Corey and I head up there for a few days
for the Chronic Altitude story video.

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,810
Before we get started,

156
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,540
I thought I should define some of the
altitude ranges for you.

157
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,120
As you can see on the slide, I have the
elevations both in meters and in feet.

158
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
I will try to get both units throughout
the section, but I may jump back and

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,980
forth a bit.

160
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,930
I apologize in advance for that.

161
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,470
It's a bad habit on my part but

162
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,550
I will tend to relay the information as
it's presented in the literature.

163
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,520
However, you can see that I have the
conversion down at the bottom of

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,410
the slide, as well.

165
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,400
So that will help you cross over to your
preferred units if needed.

166
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,170
Low altitude includes cit, cities like
Denver.

167
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,150
When you head up to Colorado Springs
you're in the moderate altitude range.

168
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,600
Also several stages of the Tour de France
and

169
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,610
Giro d'Italia climb up into that range.

170
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,080
But things really start to get dicey, when
you reach the high altitude and,

171
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,080
of course, extreme altitude ranges.

172
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,030
These include Pikes Peak and Mt Everest
respectively.

173
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,630
So, we will spend most of our time talking
about the impact of high altitude.

174
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,440
So now to the good stuff.

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,490
The primary physiologic challenge at
altitude is the low oxygen pressure.

176
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,440
As you can see from the numbers on my
right, as you go up in elevation,

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,370
the percentage of the oxygen in the
surrounding air stays at 20.93, but

178
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,060
the barometric pressure falls.

179
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,370
Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen
falls also.

180
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,830
If you trace the numbers in the partial
pressure of oxygen row,

181
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,400
second from the bottom, you will see that
the pressure of oxygen on the summit of

182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,920
Everest is about 1 3rd that of sea level.

183
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,700
As the barometric pressure falls, the air
expands to take up a larger volume.

184
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,750
You may have experienced a classic
illustration of this when you were

185
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,970
in the mountains.

186
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,480
Increased farting.

187
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,830
The gas in your gut expands, and wants
out.

188
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,580
Anyhow, the lower pressure also means,
there are fewer molecules of oxygen and

189
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,779
air in a given space which causes the
temperature to fall.

190
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,030
Typical temperatures are listed in the
last row of the table,

191
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,740
from 59 degrees Fahrenheit in Miami to
minus 46 on Everest.

192
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,230
In my experience with Miami, the
temperature is more like 90.

193
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,210
But either way, it is quite a range.

194
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,040
The falling oxygen pressure is felt
throughout the whole body and

195
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,690
can greatly affect your physical and
cognitive performance.

196
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,490
On my right is a graph of oxygen transport
cascade for three different elevations.

197
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,430
The graph starts where the previous table
left off,

198
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,610
at the oxygen pressure of the surrounding
or inspired air.

199
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,300
What happens next?

200
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,460
The air that you breathe into your lungs,
first mixes with the water vapor and

201
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,940
the carbon dioxide coming from metabolism
that is already in your lungs.

202
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,570
So by the time, that oxygen gets into the
alveolar spaces, which are the gas

203
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,150
exchanging areas of the lungs, it is now a
smaller percentage of the total air mix.

204
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,610
So like, with the altitude tense, the
partial pressure of oxygen is less because

205
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,660
it makes up a smaller portion of their
overall gas If you're confused by

206
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,790
partial pressures, it is explained more
fully in the glossary.

207
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,180
Looking at the purple sea level line on
the graph,

208
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,863
you can see that the alveolar gas has an
oxygen partial pressure of about 105.

209
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,900
From there the gas diffuses into the
arterial blood rather efficiently so

210
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,760
there's not much loss of pressure there.

211
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,120
Gasses move from high pressure to low
pressure and the higher the pressure

212
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,000
the more the driving force is to send that
gas to the other compartments.

213
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,380
The arterial blood then circulates around
the body to the tissues

214
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,019
where the oxygen is extracted as needed.

215
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,340
Whatever oxygen is not extracted returns
to the lungs and

216
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,800
the mixed venous blood is illustrated on
the graph.

217
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,750
Now look at the blue line which represents
an altitude of 4300 meters, or

218
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,010
equivalent to Pike's Peak.

219
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,890
You can see that the whole cascade is
impacted.

220
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,460
You start lower with the inspired air.

221
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,950
Therefore, when the oxygen mixes with the
water and

222
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,940
the carbon dioxide, it is again lower.

223
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,250
You get good transfer still into the
arterial blood, but your levels are so

224
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,230
much lower to start, that there is much
less oxygen available for

225
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,420
your tissues to extract.

226
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,740
When you look at the green Everest line,
it is even flatter,

227
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,980
meaning there is almost no oxygen
available for your tissues to extract.

228
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,350
We all know that our tissues can't
survive,

229
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,760
much less exercise, without oxygen.

230
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,120
Here is our friendly Fick equation
describing the components of

231
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,140
the oxygen consumption.

232
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,930
The volume of oxygen consumed is equal to
cardiac output, Q,bBlood pumped

233
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,080
from the heart per minute times the
arterial venous oxygen difference.

234
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,450
With acute exposure, it is the a component
of the equation that is most impacted.

235
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,040
As the arterial oxygen pressure gets lower
and

236
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,400
lower, the a minus v O2 difference
approaches 0.

237
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,990
So that on the summit of Mount Everest,

238
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,110
even if your heart is racing you can't get
enough oxygen to the tissues.

239
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,070
Without acclimatization, you would die.

240
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,130
The result of this decreasing oxygen
cascade is that your

241
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,979
maximum work capacity, your VO2 max,
falls.

242
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,450
There is some variability, but the general
rule is that VO2max will fall off 1% for

243
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,820
each 100 meters over 1500 meters.

244
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,210
So on the summit of Pike's Peak,

245
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,840
that means a fall off in maximum oxygen
consumption of about 27%.

246
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,240
On Everest, 75%, which means someone with
a VO2 max

247
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,590
of 60 which is quite good at sea level
would fall to less then 15 on Everest.

248
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,580
That is equivalent to walking slowly on
the flat with a light pack,

249
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,160
can you imagine trying to climb with
Everest with that kind of work capacity.

250
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,730
From descriptions by climbers and
scientific studies from the 60s,

251
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,450
we know that in order to move in that
situation, you need to take about six to

252
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,410
eight breaths per step and you still need
to rest every 20-30 yards.

253
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,659
Which is why most people use supplemental
oxygen when they climb Everest.

254
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,480
The limited oxygen availability doesn't
just affect maximum performance, but

255
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,638
affects sub-maximum performance as well.

256
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:19,590
Let's give Corey a hypothetical challenge
at 4,500 meters where he tries to

257
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,170
exercise to maximum and compare it to sea
level.

258
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,949
His VO2 max falls about 30 percent.

259
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,470
But now, a set task, say riding the bike
at 125 watts, which is depicted

260
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,800
in the red on the graph, represents a
higher percentage of his maximum.

261
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,190
Therefore, everything he does will seem
harder at altitude.

262
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,850
Climbing, making camp, competing in a
cycling event will all be harder, and

263
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,439
he won't be able to sustain that same
absolute workload as long at altitude.

264
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,939
Since we spend most of our time performing
sub-maximal tasks,

265
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,750
the sub-maximal impact will be more
noticeable decrement in performance.

266
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,090
It is logical that being more fit should
help you do better at altitude, and

267
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,850
it certainly does in some ways.

268
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,930
It requires great strength and stamina to
climb mountains.

269
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,080
But, interestingly, some of the advantage
that fit people have at sea level,

270
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,530
relative to less fit people, is lost at
altitude.

271
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,830
Because the fall in VO2 max is a
percentage.

272
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,520
So a recreational athlete with a VO2 max
of 45 at sea level will drop to

273
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
about 12 on Everest.

274
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,700
Similarly, a much fitter guy with a C
level VO2 max of 60 will drop to 15.

275
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,230
So there's a convergence of these values
at altitude.

276
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,290
Why is that?

277
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,730
It has to do with the concept of transit
time.

278
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,910
Transit time is the amount of time that
blood is in contact with

279
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,280
the exchanging tissues.

280
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,360
In this case, the lungs.

281
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,950
Highly fit people have very high cardiac
outputs, meaning that their

282
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,790
hearts are pumping larger volumes of blood
in very rapid rate to the heart and lungs.

283
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,560
So the blood has less time to fully
saturate with oxygen as it

284
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,700
passes through the lungs.

285
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,000
Remember how I said earlier that the
higher the gas pressure the greater

286
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,189
the driving force of movement for that
gas.

287
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,170
Therefore at sea level, the high cardiac
output in athletes is less problematic.

288
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,910
Because the gas diffuses into the blood
more rapidly with the higher pressures.

289
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,590
However, at altitude, the diffusion rate
slows, so the arterial oxygen

290
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,310
saturation falls as cardiac output
increases at the higher workloads.

291
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,150
Thus, the O2 max declines to a greater
extent in fit versus unfit people.

292
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,470
In summary, more fit equals higher Q,
equals lower transit time.

293
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,320
Shorter transit time in fit means less
oxygen in the blood at

294
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,630
higher workloads and greater falloff is
VO2 max.

295
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,790
The bad news is that we are challenged to
perform at altitude,

296
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,630
even if we are highly fit.

297
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,420
However, the good news is that our bodies
respond to

298
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,290
the low oxygen right away to try to help
us cope.

299
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,690
We've spent this last, rather extended
module talking about the challenges to

300
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,840
performance at high altitude.

301
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,780
Next we'll move on to what our bodies
actually do about it.

302
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,420
Congratulations you survived Module 2.

303
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,920
Take the practice quiz for this module and
then go on to Module 3 to

304
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,340
learn about the initial physiological
responses to altitude and

305
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,980
see how Corey actually performed in the
chamber relative to what was expected.

306
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,480
Thank you.
