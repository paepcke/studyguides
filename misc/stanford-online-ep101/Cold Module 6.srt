00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,130
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,840
We only have a couple of cold modules left
in this section.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,660
Now we're going to talk about chronic
adaptations to cold.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,560
Unfortunately for

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,080
us humans, there is not a lot we can do in
the cold, physiologically speaking.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,190
We are tropical animals,

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,830
which means we can do more to adapt to the
heat than to the cold.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,000
Our main adaptations are behavioral, such
as putting on clothes, seeking shelter or

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,460
lighting a fire.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,680
When it comes to cold, we mainly just get
used to it.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,850
However, there are a few things that our
bodies can do, to relieve cold stress.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,410
One thing that we do, is release hormones
like norepinephrine and thyroxine.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,750
Norepi, norepinephrine,

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,010
is a catecholamine released by the
sympathetic nervous system.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,920
Thyroxine, is the predominant hormone
released from the thyroid gland.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,500
Together norepinephrine and

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,990
thyroxine increase metabolic rate through
a variety of mechanisms.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,880
One mechanism of interest is the
uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,980
As I mentioned earlier in this section,

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,580
oxidative phosphorylation is the normally
tightly coupled process in

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,270
the body where oxygen is used to form the
body's energy currency, known as ATP.

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,080
When the process is uncoupled, energy is
used but

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,900
ATP is not being produced, which results
in excess heat generation.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,920
Again, the common analogy is revving your
engine at

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,130
the stop light with the clutch in.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,310
A tissue that is particularly good at
uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation is

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,050
brown adipose tissue, or BAT.

28
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,030
Unlike white adipose tissue, brown adipose
has a lot of mitochondria and more blood

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,790
vessels, which makes it metabolically
active and gives it its brownish color.

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,990
Brown adipose is common in rodents,
hibernating animals, and babies.

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,990
If you put a rat in the fridge, it'll
uncouple its brown adipose tissue,

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,000
generate more heat, and be happy as a
clam.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,530
If you think about it, if you were an
animal who was at risk of being pray,

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,490
being able to generate heat without
shivering, is definitely a good thing.

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,300
You'd be able to hide better, and sleep
better for that matter.

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,180
Human babies have brown adipose along
their spines and

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,680
upper backs, which is also a good thing.

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
They don't shiver, either, and they can't
regulate their own body temperature,

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,820
temperature simply by getting up and
getting a blanket or going for a jog.

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,524
For many years, it was believed that
adults didn't have brown adipose tissue,

41
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,520
but it turns out that we do.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,210
We just didn't have the right tools to
find it.

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,910
Some adults have more than others, and

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,309
those that have more, tend to be leaner,
than those with less of it.

45
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,220
Therefore, people are now discussing brown
adipose tissue as a possible target for

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,780
weight loss.

47
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,112
Brown fat seems to be up regulated in
colder climates.

48
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:43,650
So there's this movement of sorts out
there by people who are trying to

49
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,300
induce the formation of more brown adipose
in themselves, by making themselves cold,

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,390
taking frigid showers in the morning,
rolling naked in the snow,

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,530
all sorts of fun stuff.

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,030
Exercise also may up regulate brown
adipose,

53
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,010
and now there is a brown fat revolution
diet.

54
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,500
It is too soon to tell whether brown
adipose will emerge as an important

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,240
contributor to weight balance in humans,
but it is an interesting issue to watch.

56
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,900
Other things that we

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,690
can do to acclimatize include intermittent
peripheral vasodilation.

58
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,780
Sometimes referred to as the hunter's
response.

59
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,345
About five to ten minutes after initial
constriction of the hand,

60
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:30,290
vasodilation occurs resulting in a warm
pulse of blood to the periphery.

61
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,740
Then the vessels constrict down again.

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,990
The response is more pronounced in people
that have lived or

63
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,320
worked in the cold for long periods of
time, thus the name hunters response.

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,560
It was thought that the response protected
the hands and

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,620
feet from cold injury, but now the
benefits are less clear.

66
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,330
Second, long time residents of cold
climates have

67
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,149
adapted by increasing the insulating layer
of subcutaneous body fat.

68
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,740
And finally, people in cold climates seem
to get used to the discomfort.

69
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,360
Cold becomes less disruptive.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,430
I actually think it is this latter element
that allows the students from

71
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,520
cold cultures to walk around campus in the
winter wearing shorts.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,929
It just doesn't feel like cold to them,
it's a habituation to discomfort.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,220
So that's it.

74
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,520
That is all we do acclimatize to the cold.

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,370
A short and sweet list.

76
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,870
Now on to the brutal stuff, risks and
consequences.

77
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,370
Thank you.
