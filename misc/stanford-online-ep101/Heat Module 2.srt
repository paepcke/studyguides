00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,450
Hello everyone, welcome to this section on
the physiology of heat.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,290
Most of us have experienced being in the
heat in some form or

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,418
another, we may live in a hot environment
or just visit one on occasion.

4
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:16,290
Being in a warm climate can feel great if
you're on vacation and

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,940
can spend a lot of time frolicking in the
cool refreshing water.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,440
But what if you're trying to do physical
work or athletically compete in the heat?

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,420
Firemen and hazmat crews sometimes have to
do high-intensity work wearing outfits far

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,800
more restrictive in terms of heat flow
than the one you saw Corey in for

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,240
the video.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,730
Athletes sometimes compete for

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,310
hours on end in environments so hot you
could fry an egg on the pavement.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,220
Fortunately, unlike cold,

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,150
our bodies are well equipped to adapt to
reasonable heat loads.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,110
Even so, work and exercise performance can
be severely compromised, and

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,790
our health put at risk by prolonged heat
exposure.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,520
Watch the videos in this section to learn
about the challenges, adaptations, and

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,373
risks that occur in hot environments.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,940
Here are some questions we will consider
as we go through the material.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,800
Of course we will address the questions we
left you with at the end of

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,370
the Corey video.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,860
Why did Corey's heart rate stay elevated
well after exercise?

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,050
How did Corey's body cool down if the room
was warmer than his core temperature?

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,160
Why did putting his hands in cold water
help lower his core temperature so much?

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Also we'll talk about what factors affect
whether your body gets hypothermic or not,

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,980
how your body responds acutely to heat,
how heat impacts exercise performance.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,390
How your body compensates during exercise
for the greater heat load.

27
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,150
How you can minimize the negatives
associated with hot

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,510
environments through acclimatization,
cooling techniques and training.

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,390
And what are the heat related illnesses
and how can you prevent and or treat them.

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,580
To my right is the organization of the
modules within this section,

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,040
that will help us answer those questions
that we just laid out.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,680
You already got to see Corey get hot in
module one,

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,480
and we'll come back to some of those
issues in module four.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,930
But as you can see we will address similar
topics as

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,889
we did in the prior cold section.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,660
Okay, let's get started with module two,
acute responses.

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,050
If you've already been through the
physiology of cold section,

38
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,200
you've seen a version of this figure.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,090
It illustrates the balance of temperature
in your body.

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,190
Here's a very brief reminder.

41
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,655
Core temperature in humans is regulated
around 37 degrees Centigrade or

42
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,100
98.6 Fahrenheit.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,230
Core temperature's a little cooler in the
mornings and

44
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,900
gets higher in the afternoon during
exercise or with a fever.

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,000
It can also be impacted by hormones,
menstrual cycle,

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,890
illnesses, problems with your thyroid,
ovulation, drugs and many other things.

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,790
We talked a lot about heat loss in the
cold section but

48
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,760
now in hot environments, heat gain
obviously becomes more of an issue.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,970
Not only do you have significant heat
produced from metabolism, but

50
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,170
now you have the potential of heat gain
from the surrounding environment.

51
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,510
That gain will be balanced against the
avenues of heat loss,

52
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,170
radiation, conduction, convection and
evaporation.

53
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,770
The four methods of heat transfer,

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,720
take on different levels of importance
based on multiple factors such as

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,940
ambient temperature, clothing, humidity
and exercise.

56
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,310
For example, in the Corey gets hot video,
we were able to manipulate changes in

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,420
his core temperature based on clothing,
exposed skin and hand cooling.

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,510
We'll talk more about those in detail when
we get to Corey's data module.

59
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,900
Definitions of the different types of heat
loss are included in the glossary in

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,090
case you need a refresher.

61
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,690
This slide is going to get a bit
complicated, but its purpose is to

62
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,600
organize the components we will be
discussing throughout the section.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,340
There are many factors that ultimately
determine whether you

64
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,120
will get hypothermia.

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,420
Hypothermia is the elevation of core body
temperature above normal.

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,010
Lets talk about the components in the blue
box on my far right.

67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,600
Heat production lays the foundation of
heat gain.

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,900
Your basal metabolic rate in any activity
above that will

69
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,150
generate heat as a by-product of
metabolism.

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,790
Remember that you're only about 25%
efficient in your reactions, and

71
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,510
the rest of the energy generated is given
off as heat.

72
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,540
Your body's circadian rhythm also affects
how warm you are.

73
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,870
As I mentioned earlier, core temperature
is usually lower in the morning and

74
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,040
then peaks in the afternoon.

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,540
The pattern matches hormonal cycles in
your body, and

76
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,900
can impact peak performances in different
athletic events based on the timing of

77
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,970
the competition throughout the day.

78
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,230
We'll talk more about that in a later
module as well.

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,390
Older adults are more at risk for

80
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,840
dying in heatwaves, so it was assumed that
age impaired thermo-regulatory capacity.

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,285
However when the effects of chronic
diseases and

82
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,950
sedentary lifestyles are taken into
account,

83
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,250
heat tolerance seems to be only minimally
compromised by age.

84
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,080
However, control of peripheral and central
blood flow is impacted by age.

85
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,740
Also dehydration is more risky in older
individuals, and re-hydration is

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,390
harder due to the differences in thirst
sensitivity and renal function.

87
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,020
Men and women do equally well in the heat,
although they get there in different ways.

88
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,820
Women tend to do it through smaller body
sizes and

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,300
better efficiency of evaporative cooling.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,810
Whereas men have the advantage of higher
sweat rates and

91
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,240
less subcutaneous fat on average.

92
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,750
As we talked about in the cold section,
body size, surface to volume ratio and

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,620
subcutaneous fat, all play a role in the
efficacy of heat loss in the body as well.

94
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,470
All of those factors in the blue box can
then be modulated by the elements in

95
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,250
the light green box that just appeared.

96
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,750
Clearly, the environmental conditions of
temperature, humidity, and

97
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,920
wind are critical.

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,210
The combination of heat and

99
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,110
humidity is the heat index, a measure of
how hot it actually feels.

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,510
If you throw in wind and

101
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,710
solar radiation, you get a measure of the
external thermal load.

102
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,610
That number is usually calculated using a
wet bulb globe temperature, and

103
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,660
is used by coaches and race organizes,
organizers, excuse me, to determine

104
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,380
the risk associated with athletic training
or competing on a particular day.

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,470
We'll talk about all the other cool
modulators [LAUGH] in the green box,

106
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,030
a bit later.

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,160
In warm environments, you're body will
actively try to

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,300
get rid of excess heat to keep your core
temperature from rising.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,500
It will do this by vaso-dilating skin
vessels to send more heat to the surface

110
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,468
to be released to the environment by
convection, evaporation and radiation.

111
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:49,830
Under the non-hairy surfaces of your body,
so your face, hands, the soles

112
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,390
of your feet, you have special vessels
called Arteriovenous anastamomoses.

113
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,640
These vessels serve as special shunts
designed as heat radiators in the body.

114
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,860
Under warm conditions, they open up,

115
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,410
allowing enhanced blood flow to the
surface and increased heat dissipation.

116
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,999
Both local signals and the sympathetic
nervous system regulate vasodilation.

117
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,940
Sweating is another important weapon
against hyperthermia.

118
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,870
When the ambient temperature is greater
than your body temperature,

119
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,930
evaporative cooling is the only means of
heat removal from the body.

120
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,000
High humidity compromises the
effectiveness of evaporative cooling, so

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,770
hot and humid environments are the most
risky in terms of hyperthermia and

122
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,309
heat illness.

123
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,860
Sweat, made up of mostly water and

124
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,680
some dissolved ions, is released by
eccrine sweat glands under the skin.

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,940
The sweat travels up the sweat duct,
through the sweat pore, and

126
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,550
onto the surface of the skin, where it
evaporates.

127
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,490
Heart rate will increase to compensate for
the elevated demands on the circulation.

128
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,840
The heart rate response is exaserbated by
dehydration because there is less blood to

129
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,690
go around and

130
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,510
thus less blood coming back to the heart
causing stroke volume to fall.

131
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,510
Ventilation will increase as well, to
expel heat through evaporative,

132
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,070
evaporation, in the lungs.

133
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,930
But is only a minor path way in humans.

134
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,918
The bodies' cooling mechanisms are
coordinated by the anterior hypothalamus

135
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,770
region of the brain in response to
multiple sensory inputs coming

136
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,080
from the brain and the periphery.

137
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,240
At my right is a typical pattern of heat
loss during rest and

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,148
exercise in a reasonably clothed person in
normal ambient conditions.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,220
At rest, with little wind,

140
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,390
radiation is the predominant means of heat
transfer out of the body.

141
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,270
However, during exercise evaporative
cooling takes on the leading role in

142
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,970
heat dissipation.

143
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,270
If the exercise involves movement through
the air or

144
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,340
water, there's also a jump up in
convective cooling.

145
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,310
Although the pattern in the graph, is
reason,

146
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,610
in a reasonable example, it is difficult
to generalize, because so

147
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,140
much of the heat loss balance depends on
the environmental conditions,

148
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,369
personal characteristics, type, and
intensity of exercise.

149
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,240
That's it for the Acute Responses Module.

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,020
Please answer the Check for Understanding
questions and move on to Module Three.

151
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,230
Which addresses exercise in the heat and
why it is so dang hard.

152
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,730
Thanks.
