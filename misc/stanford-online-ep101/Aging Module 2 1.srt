00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,150
Welcome to the Physiology of Aging
section.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,640
We've put this into the Environmental
Physiology class because you're

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,380
really looking at the effects of time on
our bodies.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,240
Which is kind of environmental.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,820
It's also such an important and relevant
topic that we couldn't resist.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,430
It affects every one of us, every day.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,320
Although we may not notice dramatic
changes for years at a time, we gradually

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,270
start to notice that it's harder for us to
do things that we used to do easily.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,300
We start to feel a little more vulnerable,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,960
a little less willing to take that leap
with our kids to the next rock or

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
less excited about taking the god kids on
the spiny ride at the fair.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,650
Or maybe we succumb to an illness or

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,420
an acute injury from which it takes us a
long time to recover.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,220
Are these changes inevitable?

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,100
Can we just push through them?

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,550
What's causing these changes?

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,640
My father used to get together with his
friends, and

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,140
go through what he called the organ
recital.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,170
Inevitably, they would start discussing
what was going wrong with

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,290
their different body parts, used to drive
me crazy.

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,720
I never really understood it until the
other day I found myself with a group of

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,230
my close friends doing exactly the same
thing, and

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,780
all the kids in the room were rolling
their eyes.

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,190
I just started laughing.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,710
You have to appreciate the irony in the
cycle of life.

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,910
So let's explore some of these issues
together in this section on aging.

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,830
Here are the questions that we're going to
ponder through this section.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,870
Like in the previous sections we'll
include from the end of

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,460
the Corey MIT Agnes video.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,480
What causes the impairments associated
with aging?

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,700
How does exercise keep Bill from
experiencing Agnes deficits?

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,540
Which aging deficits are improved with
diet and exercise and which are fixed?

33
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,360
We'll also discuss issues related to
healthy aging,

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,449
diseases, cognitive function and special
concerns for Masters Athletes.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,210
Now keep in mind, as we go through the
material in this section that

36
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,990
I am an exercise physiologist by training.

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,150
So, a lot of the information you will
receive today will have a physical

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,260
activity flavor to it.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,130
We'll look both at how aging can impact
exercise performance, but

40
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,440
also the reverse, how physical activity
can affect aging.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,330
Fortunately, physical activity is the
ultimate healthy aging pill.

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,230
So there's a lot to talk about on this
subject.

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,450
This section is going to be a little
different than previous ones in

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,220
that the both the practical tips and the
answers to Cory's questions will be

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,810
woven throughout the material rather than
having their separate modules at the end.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,960
I hope that we'll keep things moving along
through this massive topic that is

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,770
the Physiology of Aging.

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,390
Let's get started with module two.

49
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,090
Here we'll be discussing the basics of
aging, and healthy aging.

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,200
Before we get started though,

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,520
I want to explain the face that you see in
the center of this slide.

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
This is Danielle.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,590
Its original format is a five minute video
by filmmaker, Anthony Cerniello.

54
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,840
We set out to emulate the aging process by
creating a person.

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,680
What we wanted to mimic was an image that
changes, but

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,030
you can't quite see it change.

57
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,750
You can only sense it, like aging itself.

58
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,910
We've had to speed it up just a little bit
to fit it into this module, but

59
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,000
the full link is in the resources at the
end of this session if you'd like to

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
watch it online as well.

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,170
Cerniello created Danielle as a composite
person.

62
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,750
A meticulously combined sequence of
related multi-generational family

63
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,480
members who were all photographed at more
or less the same time.

64
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,175
While I'm talking you will see her get old
without actually seeing her change,

65
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,582
so keep watching.

66
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,450
So what is aging?

67
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,410
Aging is the process of how things change
over time in an organism.

68
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,700
The Merriam Webster Dictionary definition
is pretty grim.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,350
Gradual change in an organism,

70
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,710
that leads to increased risk of weakness,
disease and death.

71
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,740
It takes place in a cell, an organ or

72
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,760
the total organism over the entire adult
lifespan of any living thing.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,130
There's a decline in biological functions
and

74
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,840
an ability to adapt to metabolic stress.

75
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,740
Yikes.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,040
That sounds pretty depressing, and
unfortunately, much of it is true.

77
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,050
You see it all around you with your
parents,

78
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,690
your grandparents, you, the old woman in
the grocery store.

79
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,950
They are clearly decrements that occur
over time however, that

80
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,010
doesn't mean there's nothing we can do to
minimize the negative aspects of aging.

81
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,560
Healthy aging or successful aging is when
individuals work throughout their life to

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,630
be free of disease, to function at a high
physical and

83
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,380
cognitive level and to be socially engaged
and productive,.

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,830
I use the term work because it does take
work there is no easy fix and

85
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,490
we are not always successful but there are
many thing we can do to

86
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,510
get closer to get closer to that goal
aging vs longevity.

87
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,640
These two terms are often confused in both
the popular press and

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,230
the scientific literature.

89
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,600
Where's aging is a process, longevity is a
measure of how long we live.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,910
Aging is actually quite hard to quantify.

91
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,850
For longevity, death is the end point, but
it doesn't say how well we've lived.

92
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,190
Why do we age?

93
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,550
On the philosophical side of the
discussion,

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,420
this is one of the great mysteries of
biology.

95
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,540
An often cited quote from the mid-century
evolutionary theorist, George Williams,

96
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,260
is written on the side to my far right.

97
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,320
He said, it is remarkable that after a
seemingly miraculous feat of

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,050
morphogenesis, a complex metazoan, which
is just a multi-celled animal.

99
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,890
Should be unable to perform the much
simpler task of

100
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,610
merely maintaining what is already formed.

101
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,200
In other words, it should be a lot harder
to create something from scratch than to

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,890
simply maintain it.

103
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,450
So why don't we maintain it?

104
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,228
As we move on with our discussion, we're
going to leave Danielle behind.

105
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,509
Bye Danielle.

106
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,220
[LAUGH] It's an amazing work of art.

107
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,390
I want to thank Corey for finding it
online and Anthony for letting us use it.

108
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,550
Biologically speaking, there are two
general theories on why we age.

109
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,440
The first is Age by Design, the idea that
we are preprogrammed to age after

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,210
reproduction to make room for the new
generation, so resources don't run out.

111
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,690
At a certain point we just stop repairing
the ongoing damage that happens to

112
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,780
our minds and bodies.

113
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,830
Support for this theory came from a
landmark study in 1993 in

114
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,110
which Cynthia Kenyon from the University
of California, San Francisco,

115
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,380
was able to double the life span of a sea
elegan's worm by mutating a single gene.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,080
The Sea Elegans worm is frequently used as
a model for aging.

117
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,610
Before that everyone thought that aging
wasn't very interesting,

118
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,620
that we just kind of wore out.

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,440
Since then, many others have been able to
manipulate lifespans in a variety of

120
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,510
organisms by altering gene expression.

121
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,590
On the other hand, we also know that aging
can be manipulated by the environment.

122
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,790
Which brings us to the accumulated damage
theory of aging.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,580
This theory suggests that through a series
of different onslaughts to our systems,

124
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,930
we slowly damage various cell
compartments, DNA, proteins, etc.,

125
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,970
as the signs of aging become more and more
apparent.

126
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,680
Within this unifying theory, there are
many hypotheses about what is

127
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,410
actually causing the damage, and some of
those are listed to my right.

128
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,190
The citation for a review paper with a
description of these different mechanisms

129
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,840
is listed at the end of this section if
you're interested in reading more.

130
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,590
Support for

131
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,620
theory two comes from studies of caloric
restriction in which both maximal and

132
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,290
average lifespan can be prolonged in many
species by dietary manipulation.

133
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,000
Suggesting that genetic control of aging
is not absolute.

134
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,820
The answer to why we age is probably a
little bit of both theories.

135
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,560
In most things, we are a combination of
our environment and

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,030
our genes and there is no reason to expect
that aging is any different.

137
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,030
This slide is for a point of
clarification.

138
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,910
Life expectancy, or average lifespan, is
not the same as maximal lifespan.

139
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,850
Life expectancy is the age where it is
expected that 50% of

140
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,470
the population will still be alive.

141
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,540
In the graph to my right you can see that
the average lifespan has

142
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,139
changed dramatically in the past 100
years.

143
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,560
The graph isn't exactly to scale, but

144
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,610
the life expectancy of a child born in
1900 was between 45 and 49 years old.

145
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
In the US, for

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,830
a child born in 2000, the life expectancy
is 77 for males and 80 for females.

147
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,520
In Japan, the new life expectancy as high
as 83.

148
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,860
We've accomplished this amazing expansion
of life span by reducing child mortality,

149
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,510
creating better vaccines, better health
care, better living conditions and

150
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,320
better nutrition.

151
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,030
You can see the influence of the better
child health by

152
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,730
comparing the initial shape of the 1900
curve compared to that of 2000.

153
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,440
There are many fewer deaths at younger
ages these days.

154
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,990
Curves for

155
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,360
animals in the wild look more like the
shape of the red curve on the graph.

156
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,730
In contrast to life expectancy, maximal
lifespan is anecdotal.

157
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,340
It changes every time we find someone that
lives longer.

158
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,970
Right now, the official documented record
is held by a Frenchwoman named

159
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,690
Jean Calmet, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

160
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,360
A total of 122 years and 164 days.

161
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,010
She was apparently quite a character and
very lively until she died.

162
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,230
She took up fencing at age 85, rode her
bike until 100, and claimed that

163
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,180
she maintained her health by using lots of
olive oil, drinking port regularly, eating

164
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,792
a kilogram or 2.2 pounds of chocolate per
week, and quitting smoking, at age 117.

165
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,540
[LAUGH] She was also very funny.

166
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,330
For example, at one of her later birthday
parties somebody left by saying,

167
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,170
until next year perhaps.

168
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,725
She looked at him and responded, I don't
see why not, you don't look so bad to me.

169
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,360
[LAUGH] Good for her.

170
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,640
In honor of Jeanne Calment's lively
attitude we're going to take

171
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,340
a mini break here so that I don't rattle
on too long.

172
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,330
I hope part one set a good foundation for
explaining why we age.

173
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,550
When you come back we'll talk about
strategies that

174
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,790
may slow the aging process.

175
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,480
Not things that are advertised on
late-night TV, but

176
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,600
things that are actually worked in the
lab.

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,120
See you soon.
