00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,492
Welcome back to the Physiology of Cold,
Module 7 -

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:06,550
Risks, Consequences and Practical Tips.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,550
You can see some of the risks in the
pictures to my right.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,860
Missing toes.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,810
Sailors with hypothermia rescued at sea by
the US Navy.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,110
There are a lot of things to consider and
prepare for when you're out in the cold.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,068
Let's start with hypothermia.

8
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:24,730
Hypothermia is when your core temperature
drops below normal, but

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,620
there are various degrees of hypothermia.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,157
A two degree drop in core temperature is
considered mild hypothermia, and

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,572
that is where you get maximal shivering,

12
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:39,137
which is just about where Cory was at the
end of his experience in the cold room.

13
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,664
Do you remember this?

14
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,566
>> Yay, victory!

15
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,339
Okay, click!

16
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,860
>> You deserve a warm blanket for that.

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,550
>> Yeah.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,050
>> Are we done?

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,130
>> Yeah, we're done.

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,060
Let's get him warmed up.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,680
>> It's so cold but the background.

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,500
There's no heat in the shoe, so you can't
freak that your hands are so cold.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,125
>> Your hands are just [LAUGH].

24
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,998
>> [NOISE]
>> Yeah, let's get me out of here.

25
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,070
>> Anyway, you get the idea.

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,063
That is some serious shivering.

27
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:10,439
A four degree centigrade drop in core
temperature is

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,850
considered moderate hypothermia.

29
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,130
At that stage you can expect to see apathy
and ataxia.

30
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,320
That means uncoordinated movements.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,440
You also start to make bad decisions
because you're not thinking clearly.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,850
Then with a six degree drop you get severe
hypothermia which can lead

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,600
to unconsciousness.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,120
A drop greater than six degrees can lead
to abnormal heart rhythms,

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,790
decreased brain blood flow and death.

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,580
A core temperature between 23 and

37
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,849
25 degrees is usually fatal, with some
exceptions.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,030
To get hypothermia, it doesn't need to be
frostbite cold.

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,110
You can get hypothermic whenever the heat
loss is greater than the amount of

40
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,960
heat your body is producing.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,970
That can even be during exercise despite
the high metabolic rate.

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,240
I remember some distinct times back in my
youth before performance fabrics when I

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,760
made myself hypothermic even in Marin
County,

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,540
California in the summer, which is not
that cold.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,120
I would ride my mountain bike up Mount Tam
in the afternoon sun,

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,390
get all sweaty in my cotton t-shirt and

47
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,090
then head down the shady side of the
mountain as the sun was setting.

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,970
Again, not that cold out, but between the
hypoglycemia, which is low blood sugar,

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,760
the shade, the windchill from riding down
and the sweat, I was so cold and shaking

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,370
so uncontrollably hard on my bike, that I
had to get off and walk down the mountain.

51
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,420
The thing about hypothermia is that it can
get bad fast.

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,640
When you depress the central nervous
system,

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,460
shivering actually stops when you need it
the most.

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,190
You also may run out of the energy needed
to do the shivering.

55
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,670
Plus you get confused, so

56
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,600
you start making poor decisions that can
make a bad situation worse quickly.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,540
Because of the depression of the central
nervous system and

58
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,690
the slowed reaction rates in your body,
your heart may beat one to

59
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,710
five times per minute right before you die
of hypothermia.

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,220
In that condition, you're not actually
dead yet,

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,450
just in a sort of suspended animation.

62
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,200
Some people have been revived from such a
condition as they warm up.

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,008
You've probably all heard about children
who have been pulled from frozen lakes

64
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:13,620
after 30 minutes and survived, even though
they looked dead initially.

65
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,795
It happens more often in children because
of their small body size.

66
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,442
Means they lose heat faster, so

67
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:22,420
they go into suspended animation more
quickly before they get brain damage.

68
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,553
So a good rule of thumb is that you're not
dead until you're actually warm and dead.

69
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:32,785
Keep that in mind if you find someone out
in the snow who is non-responsive.

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,690
Here's some practical advice on avoiding
and treating hypothermia.

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,440
Most of it's common sense, but we'll go
quickly through it anyway.

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,730
For prevention, cover up in layers that
you can remove during exercise and

73
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,370
quickly put back on afterwards.

74
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,970
Stay dry and avoid overexertion, both
because the sweat will make you wet, and

75
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,960
if you deplete your energy reserves, it'll
be harder to stay warm.

76
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,120
If someone is hypothermic, you can do the
following.

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,350
Remove their wet clothes, and insulate
them from the cold ground.

78
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,810
Get the person lying down flat, and warm
them with blankets or

79
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,020
whatever you have available.

80
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,110
If the person is not shivering,

81
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,070
then moderate external warmth like body
heat or heating pads can be helpful.

82
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,260
You've all seen scenes in movies where two
people have to get naked in

83
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,390
a sleeping bag to recover from
hypothermia.

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,518
It usually leads to no good in the movies,
but

85
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,600
it can be an effective way to warm someone
up.

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,260
However, if someone is still shivering,

87
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,770
they'll warm faster if you just dry them
off, insulate them and let them shiver.

88
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,500
The moderate external heat can suppress
shivering and

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,990
won't warm them up any faster.

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,060
By the way, the best place for warm
heating pads, hot water bottles or

91
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,500
whatever you have available is the neck,
face, groin, and

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,670
armpits where the capillary beds are close
to the surface.

93
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,950
Whether to warm the periphery is
controversial at this point.

94
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,880
Some say it will help rewarming.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,540
Others fear it will increase the risk of
afterdrop in cases of moderate to

96
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,830
severe hypothermia.

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,190
The experimental warming devices we used
in the Cory Warms Up

98
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,970
video may circumvent this problem by
selecting the less muscular arms for

99
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,000
rewarming, rather than the legs that are
greater cold sinks.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,530
It's also designed to send rapidly warmed
blood back to the core,

101
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,660
but more research is needed to determine
whether it is effective and safe in

102
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,020
cases of more severe hypothermia than Cory
experienced in our demonstration.

103
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,710
If conscious, give warm beverages and
easily digestible calories to

104
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,770
treat dehydration and hypoglycemia, which
frequently accompanies hypothermia.

105
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,670
Don't use hot water or apply direct heat
that can cause damage to the tissues.

106
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,960
And finally, with moderate or severe
hypothermia, seek medical treatment.

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,870
Warm intravenous fluids can be given, or
in extreme cases blood can

108
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,270
actually be removed from the body by
machine like a dialysis unit, warmed, and

109
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,380
then re-circulated back into the patient.

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,320
Overall, remember to be gentle when
handling someone with hypothermia.

111
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,840
The cold can make the electrical activity
of the heart unstable, so jarring or

112
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,150
aggressive movements could lead to cardiac
arrest.

113
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,530
Also, watch rescued victims closely, even
if they seem okay initially,

114
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,530
because frequently core temperature will
get worse before it starts getting better,

115
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,430
and they could experience post rescue
collapse.

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,650
Frostbite usually affects smaller exposed
areas of skin like fingers,

117
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,120
toes, noses, ears, chins and cheeks.

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,160
It occurs when the skin and the tissue
right underneath it freezes.

119
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,830
First, your skin becomes very cold, then
numb, hard, and pale.

120
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,270
Frostnip, the first stage of frostbite,
irritates the skin but

121
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,420
doesn't cause permanent damage.

122
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,600
Severe frostbite, on the other hand, can
damage skin, tissue, muscle, and

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,530
even bones, leading to complications,
complications such as infection, gangrene,

124
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,480
and nerve damage.

125
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,080
Gangrene is death and subsequent decay of
the tissues, as above, and

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,020
frequently requires amputation of the
affected areas.

127
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,120
You can get frostbite both by fall in core
temperature accompanied by

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,640
prolonged interruption of warm blood
supply to the peripheral tissues or

129
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,039
from direct contact with a freezing
surface.

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,770
If you are trying to give first aid for

131
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,100
frostbite, slowly rewarm the tissues in
moderate temperatures, and don't rub.

132
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,800
Direct heat, hot temperatures and

133
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,360
rubbing can damage the tissues that are
frozen and numb.

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,330
Also, if there is a chance that the
tissues are going to refreeze,

135
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,940
don't try to thaw them until you are all
out of danger.

136
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,150
If it doesn't look like the affected areas
are getting better,

137
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,020
seek medical attention.

138
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,670
A variety of different strategies can be
applied such as sterile dressings,

139
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,220
pain killers, debridement, which is the
removal of dead or

140
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,890
damaged tissue, antibiotics, hydrotherapy,
or surgery.

141
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,560
[BLANK_AUDIO]

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,990
When things go bad, continued.

143
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,550
Paradoxical undressing.

144
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,670
20 to 50% of people who experience
moderate to

145
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,380
severe hypothermia undergo a phase of
disorientation, confusion, and

146
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,199
combativeness that ends in their taking
off all their clothes.

147
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,450
That in turn increases heat loss and
accelerates their hypothermia and demise.

148
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,480
Although rescue workers are trained to
expect it, the nakedness of

149
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,250
the victims has sometimes led to the
mistaken assumption of sexual assault.

150
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,460
When I asked my Stanford class why they
thought this might happen,

151
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,040
I got some interesting responses ranging
from delirium and

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,960
confusion, which does probably play a
role,

153
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,740
to nerve endings that can't feel cold any
more,which is a reasonable explanation,

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,630
to, if I'm going to die I may as well go
out in a dramatic fashion.

155
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,400
Okay, whatever.

156
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,110
To, I'd rather look good than feel good.

157
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,610
Cute.

158
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,000
Anyway, the mechanism is unclear.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,390
As you can imagine, it is a hard research
study to do, but one theory is

160
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,230
that the severe cold disrupts the
hypothalamus that is responsible for

161
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,830
the body temperature regulation.

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,220
My favorite theory is that as you get
exhausted, cold, and

163
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,350
hypoglycemic, you lose the ability to keep
your peripheral vessels constricted.

164
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,470
Therefore, you get a sudden flush of
warmer blood from the core to

165
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,700
the cold peripheral tissues.

166
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,310
You suddenly feel very warm and

167
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,410
flushed and your, in your confused state,
you take off all of your clothes.

168
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,130
Wait.

169
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,840
What was that?

170
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,050
Terminal burrowing is something else that
occurs in end stages of hypothermia and

171
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,350
is often associated with paradoxical
undressing.

172
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,430
It is a preservation behavior where an
individual tries to squeeze into

173
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,010
tight spaces like under desks, in the
holes of trees or under beds to stay warm.

174
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,750
Okay.

175
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,830
I'm not trying to depress you or anything,
but

176
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,140
some of this information could come in
useful sometime.

177
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,840
I hope not, but you never know.

178
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,405
So, when things go bad.

179
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,320
Final.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,710
Cold water immersion.

181
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,150
Let's say you're out sailing in the winter
in the ocean, and your boat capsizes.

182
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,130
Yikes!

183
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,010
If the water temperature is very cold,

184
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,260
you're at risk from the initial cold shock
response.

185
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,870
You probably have experienced it.

186
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,320
You jump off of a rope swing into a lake
that is much colder than you expect, and

187
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,370
it knocks the breath out of you.

188
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,260
Your first response is to gasp, and

189
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,510
if you're underwater at the time, that can
be deadly.

190
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,430
Hyperventilation is also common, and

191
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,800
in some cases it can lead to cardiac
arrest if the shock is great enough.

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,090
The key is to try not to panic, which will
make the cold response worse.

193
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,230
If you survive the first minute, you need
to start to worry about hypothermia.

194
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,600
As we talked about earlier in the cold
section,

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,620
water draws heat away from your body much
faster than air.

196
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,940
The numbers at the bottom of the slide
give an indication of how long

197
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,560
a person can survive in water of varying
temperatures.

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,770
You can see that there are pretty wide
ranges, but if you are in water that

199
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,530
is just above freezing, the survival time
is only between 30 and 90 minutes.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,620
You may be tempted to swim for

201
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,700
shore, but keep in mind that it will make
it harder for someone to find you.

202
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,460
If you're away from your boat, your head
will look like a basketball in the ocean.

203
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,430
Also in the long run, swimming will make
you colder by increasing the movement of

204
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,970
water across your limbs, sending blood to
the periphery and

205
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,460
depleting important energy reserves.

206
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,999
Few people can swim a mile in 50 degree
water.

207
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,320
If you find yourself in such a situation,
and

208
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,060
I hope you don't, the general advice is as
follows.

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,160
Swim only if you are close to shore.

210
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,100
Otherwise, stay with the boat, which will
be the most visible thing in the water,

211
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,890
and wait for rescue.

212
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,560
Try to get out of the water by climbing
onto debris.

213
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,710
If you are with others, huddle together
face-first to reduce heat loss.

214
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,840
Try to trap air in your clothing to make
yourself more buoyant, so

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,630
you don't have to tread water which will
waste energy and increase heat loss.

216
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,940
Signal rescue with whatever you have,
flairs, mirrors, flashlights, whatever.

217
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,320
Congratulations for finishing the
Physiology of Cold Section.

218
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,120
We hope you will never have to use the
information in the last modules on risk,

219
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,590
but we tried to provide you with some
practical tips, nonetheless.

220
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,290
To get credit for this section, please
take the final quiz.

221
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:43,208
The next section is the Physiology of
Heat,

222
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:49,024
so get ready to see Cory get hot.

223
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,787
[LAUGH]

224
00:12:53,787 --> 00:13:02,784
Thanks for watching.
