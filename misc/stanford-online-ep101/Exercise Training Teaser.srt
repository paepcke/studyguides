1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,575
Corey and Sanford, thank you so much for
agreeing to talk to me.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:06,740
[SOUND] TAing the exercise physiology
class.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,910
This year, in addition to the normal
duties associated with TAing,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,925
I'm going to ask that you give your bodies
to science.

5
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:19,310
[SOUND] So, I've written up a couple
contracts here you can look through.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,425
>> Where do I sign?

7
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,310
>> [LAUGH]
>> Alright.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,290
Look, your RER values are at 0.74.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,170
You really haven't eaten much today.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,220
>> Yeah.
>> All right, ten seconds, so

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,065
we're going up, we hope.

12
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:36,170
[LAUGH] If that is working right.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,995
>> Where are you at, Sanford?

14
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,445
>> I am [INAUDIBLE].

15
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,980
>> Okay, up we go.

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,335
Yes, up we go!

17
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:49,120
[LAUGH]
>> Ten seconds!

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,790
>> Come on!

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,490
>> Push it, [UNKNOWN]!
>> He got it!

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,950
Alright, alright, alright.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,670
That it?

22
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,560
You done?

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,968
Good.

24
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,870
>> Yeah, now you're pumping that VO2 up.

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,421
>> Yup, there you go.
>> You're looking great,

26
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,550
you're looking great.

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,800
>> That a way Corey come on.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,720
>> Come on.

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,960
>> You got this.

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,530
You got this.

31
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,322
>> Just 30 seconds.
>> Aah!

32
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,170
>> You got, it Corey.

33
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,300
>> Keep that speed up.

34
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,158
>> Fight hard.
Come on Corey.

35
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,306
>> [UNKNOWN]
>> Huh-uh.

36
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:21,256
>> [UNKNOWN]
>> Does it feel like it?

37
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:24,010
>> [UNKNOWN]
>> Come on.

38
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,770
Every rep, every rep.

39
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,620
Let's go.

40
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,200
Drop and drive.

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,710
Drop and drive.

42
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,188
Let's go.

43
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:28,993
Chest up, chest up, chest up.

44
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,906
>> Aah!

45
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,108
>> Keep pushing, alright.

46
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,487
I'm bringing the wattage down.

47
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm bringing the wattage down.

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,710
Keep those legs spinning a little bit.

49
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,510
You can take off the headgear whenever you
want.

50
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,900
>> Single it now, single it.

51
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,440
Gotta work hard here, we gotta work hard.

52
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,940
Come on.

53
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,780
Go hard.

54
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,050
Finish, finish, finish.

55
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,014
Way to finish it.

56
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:52,831
>> Way to go.

57
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,440
Keep pushing.

58
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,787
Alright.

59
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:59,418
Well you went a lot farther didn't you.

60
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,087
You went a whole stage farther.

61
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,772
>> I definitely feel stronger.

62
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:03,571
>> Good.

63
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,150
And you've been putting on weight, right?

64
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,380
>> Yeah.
So, I'm up about eight pounds right now.

65
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,455
So hopefully that's muscle.

66
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,820
[LAUGH]
>> Okay.

67
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,520
The TAs are back for their final testing
round.

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,065
Now they've traded places.

69
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:20,420
Sanford is getting his dexa scan done to
get his body composition and bone density.

70
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,157
Corey and Sanford look over their body
composition results.

71
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:33,724
>> This is, if he does this for reps, this
is probably about ten pounds heavier.

72
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:34,604
I'm sorry,

73
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:40,200
20 pounds heavier than what his estimated
one rep max was what three weeks?

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,266
Four weeks ago, when we did our midterm
testing with him.

75
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,193
>> Come on, baby.

76
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:45,970
What do you got left?

77
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,730
What do you got left?

78
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,130
Squeeze it now.
>> Lets go Sanford.

79
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,220
>> Cmon baby, what do you got left?

80
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,140
Come on!

81
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,200
Chest up here we go.

82
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,720
Come on!

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,005
Push!
Come on, baby, squeeze it!

84
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:06,225
[SOUND] His squat went up about 8%.

85
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:09,207
>> Is that a significant gain that you
see?

86
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:10,208
>> Absolutely.

87
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,540
>> If you actually pay attention to,
kind of like, the numbers and

88
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,948
the actual progress you're making,

89
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:17,830
it's a little, a little bit more inspiring
at the end when you know, you've improved.

90
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,990
>> And that's one of the great motivators
with physical activities.

91
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,260
>> Yeah.
>> When you start to track it and

92
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,010
see those changes that'll keep you coming
back for more.

93
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,380
>> And sometimes, you don't get the
results that you're looking for.

94
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,120
I mean, I was very disappointed.

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,620
Yesterday, I was very disappointed.

96
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,590
>> So do you think you're going to keep
cycling?

97
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,100
>> I think I will keep cycling, actually.

98
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,090
So the story is that two of my best
training partners are these

99
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,080
two 13-year-old female twins.

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,420
Beat these two little 13-year-old girls
up.

101
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
This is, like, literally the seventh time
we've gone up.

102
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,000
All bonded together.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,529
So it's an important perspective.

104
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,520
To realize that being a 13-year-old is not
the end all, be all.

105
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
I made her cry.

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,655
And I feel more bad about making her cry.

107
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,890
[LAUGH] But I did good about getting
better.

108
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,725
So. [LAUGH] >> She's gotta learn, you
know?

109
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:01,550
>> [LAUGH] To meet with failure too.

110
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,280
>> Life lesson.

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,940
>> Yeah.
>> Life is about.

112
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,280
>> You can't always be on top.

113
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,326
>> Yeah.

114
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:11,316
[LAUGH]
