00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,999
Welcome back to the Physiology of Cold:
Module 7- Risks,

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,510
Consequences & Practical Tips.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,910
You can see some of the risks in the
pictures to my right: missing toes,

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,770
sailors with hypothermia rescued at sea by
the US Navy.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,070
There are a lot of things to consider and
prepare for when you're out in the cold.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,020
Let's start with hypothermia.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,540
Hypothermia is when your core temperature
drops below normal.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,580
But there are various degrees of
hypothermia.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,064
A two degree drop in core temperature is
considered mild hypothermia, and

10
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,444
that is where you get maximal shivering,

11
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:39,138
which is just about where Corey was at the
end of his experience in the cold room.

12
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,659
Do you remember this?

13
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,603
Yay, victory.

14
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:46,422
>> Awesome.
>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]

15
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,258
>> You did different warm

16
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,034
[INAUDIBLE] to that.

17
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:48,840
>> Yeah.
>> Are we done?

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,116
>> Yeah we're done, let's get him warmed
up.

19
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,810
>> It's so cold [INAUDIBLE] background,
there's no heat in the shoe so

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,470
you can't feel that your hands are so
cold.

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,059
>> Your hands are just [LAUGH]
>> [SOUND]

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,993
>> Okay, let's get you out of here.

23
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,020
>> Anyway, you get the idea.

24
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,728
That is some serious shivering, shivering.

25
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:09,852
A four degree centigrade drop in core
temperature is

26
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,810
considered moderate hypothermia.

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,111
At that stage, you can expect to see
apathy and

28
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:18,270
ataxia, that means uncoordinated
movements.

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,390
You also start to make bad decisions
because you're not thinking clearly.

30
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,780
Then, with a six degree drop,

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,560
you get severe hypothermia, which can lead
to unconsciousness.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,080
A drop greater than six degrees can lead
to abnormal heart rhythms,

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,740
decreased brain blood flow, and death.

34
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,480
A core temperature between 23 and

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,800
25 degrees is usually fatal, with some
exceptions.

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,860
To get hypothermia, it doesn't need to be
frostbite cold.

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,320
You can get hypothermic whenever the heat
loss is greater than the amount of

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,250
heat your body is producing, that can even
be during exercise,

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,710
despite the high metabolic rate.

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,640
I remember some distinct times back in my
youth, before performance fabrics were so

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,270
common, when I made myself hypothermic
even in Marin County,

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,080
California in the summer, which is not
that cold.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,420
I would ride my mountain bike up Mount Tam
in the afternoon in the sun,

44
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,730
get all sweaty in my cotton t-shirt, and

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,390
then head down the shady side of the
mountain as the sun was setting.

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,620
Again, not that cold out, but between the
hypoglycemia, which is low blood sugar,

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,770
the shade, the wind chill from riding
down, and the sweat, I was so cold and

48
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,420
shaking so uncontrollably on my bike, I
had to get off and walk down the mountain.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,250
The thing about hypothermia is that it can
get bad fast.

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,820
When you depress the central nervous
system,

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,720
shivering actually stops when you need it
the most.

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,150
You also may out of the energy you needed
to do the shivering,

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,410
plus you start to get very confused.

54
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,370
So you start making poor decisions, that
can make a bad situation worse quickly.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,930
Because of the depression of the central
nervous system and

56
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,160
the slowed reaction rates in your body,
your heart rate may beat one to

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,120
five times per minute, right before you
die of hypothermia.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,820
In that condition, you're not actually
dead yet, just in a sort of,

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,970
suspended animation.

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,550
Some people have been revived from such
condition as they warm up.

61
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,020
You've probably all heard about children,
who have been pulled from frozen lakes,

62
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,060
after thirty minutes, and survive, even
though they look initially dead.

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,895
It happens more in children because their
small body size means they lose heat

64
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:30,494
faster, so they go into suspen-, suspended
animation more quickly,

65
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,070
before they get brain damage.

66
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,890
So a good rule of thumb is that you're not
dead until you're warm and dead.

67
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,535
Keep that in mind if you find someone out
in the snow who is non-responsive.

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,600
In such a situation, it's difficult to
know whether to start CPR,

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,930
because the very low ventilation and heart
rate are hard to detect.

70
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,650
If you start CPR and the heart is still
beating,

71
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,910
you can cause ventricular fibrillation, or
an irregular heart rhythm.

72
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,010
In fact, when the heart is very cold,

73
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,650
any type of abrupt movement can put the
heart at risk, so be careful.

74
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,910
Therefore it's recommended that, you start
a short period of assisted ventilation,

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,244
to hopefully increase Oxygen levels, and

76
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,610
thus cardiac function, to a point where it
can be detected.

77
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,030
After that, if you can't find a carotid,
pulse in more than 60 seconds, start CPR.

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,280
Here's some practical advice on avoiding
and treating hypothermia; most

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,060
of it is common sense but we'll go through
it quickly anyway.

80
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,960
For prevention, cover up in layers that
you can remove during exercise and

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,468
quickly put back on afterwards.

82
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:45,110
Stay dry and avoid over exertion both
because, the sweat will make you wet, and

83
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,730
if you deplete your energy reserves it'll
be harder to stay warm.

84
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,980
If someone is hypothermic you can do the
following: remove their wet clothes and

85
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,520
insulate them from the cold ground.

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,960
Warm them with blankets or whatever you
have available.

87
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,920
If the person is not shivering, then
moderate external warmth like body heat or

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,220
heating pads can be helpful.

89
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,524
We've all seen scenes in movies when two
people have to get naked in

90
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:13,460
a sleeping bags to recover from
hypothermia.

91
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,210
It usually leads to no good in the movies,
but

92
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,000
it can be an effective way to warm someone
up.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,920
However, if someone is still shivering,
they'll warm faster if you just dry them

94
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,670
off, insulate them, and then, then let
them shiver, because moderate external

95
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,110
heat can suppress shivering and won't warm
them up any faster.

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,280
By the way, the best places to put warm
compresses or

97
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,100
pads are the neck, face, groin, and arm
pits.

98
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,400
Don't put warm compresses on the
periphery,

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,180
as it could force cold blood back to the
core and increase after drop.

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,230
If available, a warm water bath starting
around 42 degrees centigrate and

101
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,050
gradually rising to 45 degrees can be an
effective way to rewarm someone.

102
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,110
But be careful of a fall in blood pressure
due to rapid vasodilation.

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,460
Also, in severe hypothermia, be cautious
about including the arms and

104
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,890
the legs in the bath, because it could
induce after drop,

105
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,279
causing core temperatures to fall rapidly
before rising again.

106
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,590
The stagnant blood also becomes very
acidic when it is trapped in

107
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,390
the peripheral tissue for long periods of
time.

108
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,610
It can cause abnormal heart rhythms if it
is returned too rapidly to the core,

109
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,300
due to peripheral rewarming.

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Therefore, it is safest to start by
rewarming the core, and keep the arms and

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,520
the legs out of the water bath at least
initially.

112
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,690
If conscious, give warm beverages and
easily digestible calories to

113
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,430
treat dehydration and hypoglycemia, which
frequently accompany hypothermia.

114
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,310
Don't use hot water or apply direct heat
that can cause damage to the tissues.

115
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,820
And finally, with moderate or severe
hypothermia, seek medical treatment.

116
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,250
Warm intrevenous fluids can be given, or
in extreme cases,

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,630
blood can be removed from the body by a
machine like a dialysis unit, warmed, and

118
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,620
then recirculated back into the patient.

119
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,780
Overall, remember to be gentle when
handling someone with hypothermia,

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,628
jarring or aggressive moments could lead
to cardiac arrest.

121
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:18,660
Also, watch rescued victims closely, even
if they seem okay initially,

122
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,590
because frequently core temperature will
get worse before it starts getting better.

123
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,170
Frostbite usually affects smaller exposed
areas of skin like,

124
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,210
fingers, toes, noses, ears, chins, and
cheeks.

125
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,240
It occurs when the skin and the tissue
right underneath it freezes.

126
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,930
First, your skin becomes very cold, then
numb, hard, and pale.

127
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,360
Frostnip, the first stage of frostbite,
irritates the skin, but

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,440
doesn't cause permanent damage.

129
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,728
Severe frostbite, on the other hand, can
damage skin, tissue, muscle, and

130
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:55,528
even bones, leading to complications,
complications such as infection, gangrene,

131
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:56,570
and nerve damage.

132
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,170
Gangrene is death and subsequent decay of
the tissues as above, and

133
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,110
frequently requires amputation of the
affected areas.

134
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,560
You can get frostbite both by fall in core
temperature,

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,970
accompanied by prolonged interruption of
warm blood supply to

136
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,119
the peripheral tissues, or from direct
contact with a freezing surface.

137
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,840
If you are trying to give first aid for

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,170
frost bite, slowly rewarm the tissues in
moderate temperatures and don't rub.

139
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,870
Direct heat, hot temperatures and

140
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,430
rubbing can damage the tissues that are
frozen and numb.

141
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,040
Also if there is a chance that the tissues
are going to refreeze don't try to

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,010
thaw them until you are all out of danger.

143
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,230
If it doesn't look like the effected areas
are getting better,

144
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,340
seek medical attention; a variety of
different strategies can be applied,

145
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,940
such as sterile dressings, pain killers,
debridement, which is the removal of

146
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,979
dead or damaged tissue, antibiotics,
hydrotherapy or surgery.

147
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,630
When things go bad continued: Paradoxical
Undressing.

148
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,760
20 to 50% of people who experience
moderate to

149
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,460
severe hypothermia undergo a phase of
disorientation, confusion and

150
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,279
combativeness that ends in their taking
off all their clothes.

151
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,530
That in turn increases heat loss and
accelerates their hypothermia and demise.

152
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,560
Although rescue workers are trained to
expect it, the nakedness of

153
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,330
the victims has sometimes led to the
mistaken assumption of sexual assault.

154
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,970
When I asked my Stanford class why they
thought this might happen, I got some

155
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,020
interesting responses, ranging from
delirium and confusion which does probably

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,400
play a role, to nerve endings that can't
feel cold anymore, which is a reasonable

157
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,395
explanation, to if I'm going to die, I may
as well go out in a dramatic fashion.

158
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:48,450
Okay, whatever.

159
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,690
To I'd rather look good than feel good,
cute.

160
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,090
Anyway, the mechanism is unclear,

161
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,420
as you can imagine it is a hard research
study to do.

162
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,190
But one theory is that the severe cold
disrupts the hypothalamus

163
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,890
that is responsible for the body
temperature regulation.

164
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,290
My favorite theory is that as you get
exhausted, cold and

165
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,420
hypoglycemic, you lose the ability to keep
your peripheral vessels constricted.

166
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,155
Therefore, you get a sudden flush of
warmer blood from the core to the cold,

167
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,780
peripheral tissues.

168
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,425
You suddenly feel very warm and

169
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:27,520
flushed; in your, in your confused state
you take off all of your clothes.

170
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,935
Wait, what was that?

171
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:34,110
[LAUGH]

172
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,120
Terminal Burrowing is something else that
occurs in end stages of hypothermia, and

173
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,420
is often associated with paradoxical
undressing.

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,670
It is a preservation behavior, where an
individual tries to squeeze into tight

175
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,080
spaces, like under desks, in the holes of
trees, or under beds to stay warm.

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,522
Okay, I'm not trying to depress you or

177
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:01,210
anything, [LAUGH] but some of this
information could come in useful sometime.

178
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,920
I hope not, but you never know.

179
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,790
So when things go bad final: Cold water
immersion.

180
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,240
Let's say you're out sailing in the winter
on the ocean and your boat capsizes.

181
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,220
Yikes!

182
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,100
If the water temperature is very cold,

183
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,350
you're at risk from the initial cold shock
response.

184
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,900
You've probably experienced it; you jump
off of a rope swing into a lake that

185
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,460
is much colder than you expect, and it
knocks the breath out of you.

186
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,350
Your first response is to gasp, and

187
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,655
if you are underwater at the time, that
can be deadly.

188
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,520
Hyperventilation is also common, and

189
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,890
in some cases, it can lead to cardiac
arrest if the shock is great enough.

190
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,198
The key is to try not to panic, which will
make the cold response worse.

191
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:47,310
If you survive the first minute, you need
to start to worry about hypothermia.

192
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,680
As we talked about earlier in the cold
section,

193
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,700
water draws heat from your body much
faster than air.

194
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,630
The numbers at the bottom of this slide,

195
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,640
give an indication of how long a person
can survive water of varying temperatures.

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,840
You can see that there are pretty wide
ranges, but if you were in water that

197
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,582
is just above freezing, the survival time
is only between 30 and 90 minutes.

198
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,690
You may be tempted to swim for

199
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,770
shore, but keep in mind that it will make
it harder for someone to find you.

200
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,530
If you're away from your boat, your head
will look like a basketball in the ocean.

201
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,990
Also, in the long run,

202
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,120
swimming can make you colder by increasing
the movement of water across your limbs,

203
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,430
sending blood to the periphery, and
depleating important energy reserves.

204
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,080
Few people can swim a mile in 50 degree
water.

205
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,390
If you find yourself in such a situation,
and

206
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,130
I hope you don't, the general advice is as
follows.

207
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,160
Swim, only if you are close to shore,
otherwise stay with the boat,

208
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,960
which will be the most visible thing in
the water, and wait for rescue.

209
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,630
Try to get out of the water by climbing on
to debris.

210
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,448
If you are with others, huddle together,
face first, to reduce heat loss.

211
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:59,920
Try to trap air into your clothing, to
make yourself more buoyant, so

212
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,720
you don't have to tread water, which will
waster energy and increase heat loss.

213
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,030
Signal rescue with whatever you have:
flares, mirrors, flashlights, whatever.

214
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,400
Congratulations for finishing the
Physiology of Cold Section!

215
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,200
We hope you will never have to use the
information in the last modules on risk,

216
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,670
but we tried to provide you with some
practical tips, nonetheless.

217
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,020
To get credit for this section please take
the final quiz.

218
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,505
The next section is the physiology of heat
so get ready to see Corey get hot.

219
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,230
[LAUGH] Thanks for watching.
