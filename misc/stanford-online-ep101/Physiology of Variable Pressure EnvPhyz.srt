1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,220
>> Jester's dead.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,390
I feel the need, the need for speed.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,810
>> Where is Cory now?

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,720
Well, we're in Livermore, California,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,240
at the local municipal airport, because
this unit is on variable pressure.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,020
So things like scuba diving, g-forces,
zero gravity.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,620
Now I was all set to do a nice mellow
kickoff for this unit, like scuba diving.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,730
But we had to amp up the excitement, so

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,080
we are going to test the effect of
g-forces on our body.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,210
So we've contracted with Air Combat USA to
go up in their fighter planes.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,700
And do some controlled maneuvers to test
the g-forces.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,250
Then the end, we're going to do a little
dog fight.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,530
So, Cory and I will duke it out, up there,
in the skies.

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,740
[LAUGH] And rumor has it, we actually get
to fly the plane, so

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm not exactly sure what that means,

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,200
except that everyone should avoid
Livermore airspace while they can.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,580
The military pilots are subjected to these
forces on a regular basis and

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,860
they learn to adapt so they can sustain
higher and higher g-forces and

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,020
they have compensatory mechanisms, like
g-suits, that pressurize the lower body.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,940
Or they use the g-strain maneuver.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,640
Which is essentially, what we like to
call, the butt-clinch.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,450
And we're going to give that a try while
we're up there.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,340
We're going to tighten up our lower bodies
to try and

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,030
keep that blood up in our heads.

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,030
We're going to see how this middle aged
woman holds up against this young guy,

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,890
that looks like he's straight out of a Top
Gun movie.

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,420
And, incidentally, a lot of his family
members are pilots and so

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,890
he's had a little bit of practice.

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,370
Not, that I'm making excuses or anything.

30
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,840
But, we're psyched to see how it goes.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,680
It's going to be a wild ride up there.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,610
How are you feeling about this?

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,190
>> Good.

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,210
I'm, I'm happy that we've been practicing
our butt clinches at the office for

35
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,770
the last five days.

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,168
So I'm hoping that pays dividends on the
back end.

37
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,570
>> Get our nose down.

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,440
Get some good energy.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,750
Get that airplane really humming so we get
right here with lots of speed and

40
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,470
energy because we'd like to go vertical.

41
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,560
We want to both pull up.

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,810
And we're looking at the other airplane.

43
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,320
And here's where we see who had the most
energy.

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,900
Somebody works their angles a little
better, pulls their Gs a little better

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,040
than the other one, and works in behind
them and takes that shot, guns, guns.

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,250
You're going to be doing 4g turns.

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,300
Since you're going to be four times your,
your body weight, essentially.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,520
The reason we're concerned with it is, as
you pull Gs, the blood in your head

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
tends to be drawn, wants to flow out of
your head down into your lower body.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,550
We begin to lose peripheral vision.

51
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,730
It closes in.

52
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,220
Strangely we begin to lose color.

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,370
So we start to see in black and white.

54
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,140
And our vision ultimately turns into just
a little tube.

55
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,970
We're looking through a soda straw.

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,240
Squeeze the muscles in your lower body.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,730
It, it tightens the muscles, constricts
the blood vessels, and

58
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,300
helps stop the blood from flowing down out
of your head.

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,730
Another maneuver that we talk about, we
call it the hook maneuver because you,

60
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,870
you breathe against a closed glottis or
throat [SOUND].

61
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,110
And you're tightened up here.

62
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,105
It helps keep the blood pressure and blood
flow up in your head.

63
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,430
[SOUND] We're also doing things that our
bodies aren't used to.

64
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,270
We're turning, we're diving, we're
rolling, we're going up and down, and

65
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,300
our inner ears that give ourselves the
balance is getting all confused.

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,750
And it's screaming in there, what are you
doing to me?

67
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,430
Please use the white bag if you're
going to be sick.

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,020
If something really catastrophic might
happen.

69
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,530
Dive out of the airplane out into the open
sky [LAUGH].

70
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,610
[MUSIC]

71
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,130
>> Here you go.

72
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,578
>> Perfect, into the blue.

73
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:46,578

74
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:57,721

75
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,193

77
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:35,636
[SOUND]

78
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:43,087
>> want to do some Gs?

79
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:46,190
want to do it?

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,840
>> Yes.

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,940
>> Okay.

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,530
We'll do it together.

83
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,520
going to, going to put on about three gs
in a left hand turn, here.

84
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,490
>> Okay.

85
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,470
Just put the nose down.

86
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,110
Now, pull back on the stick, a little bit.

87
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,430
Nice and smooth.

88
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,325
There's two, and there's [CROSSTALK].

89
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,002
>> Woah!
>> Two and a half.

90
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,671
There's three gs.

91
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,960
>> Wow!
>> Back up.

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,510
There we go.

93
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,580
>> Woo!

94
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,710
>> There you go.

95
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,790
>> Over the jump.

96
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,040
>> Woo!

97
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
Look over the chop this way.

98
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,840
>> Losing the vision here.

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,540
>> That's all right, you're back, you'll
get it back here in a second.

100
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,430
You're doing good, huh?

101
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,440
>> Yeah, okay.

102
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,610
>> Of course all you students want me to
get you sick,

103
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,900
that's the first thing they say.

104
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,450
You're not going to get sick Okay, start
pulling back, pulling back.

105
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,242
>> Oh, There we go.

106
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:32,647
>> Over the top,look out the side.

107
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,690
>> Alright, cool.

108
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,420
Okay.
>> You can keep that [UNKNOWN] helmet

109
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,690
if you like and we'll do our yo-yos.

110
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,940
>> Okay, relax the back pressure, relax
the back pressure, over the top.

111
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,980
Oh yeah!

112
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,260
>> Straight down baby.

113
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,960
>> [NOISE]
>> Back up we're going to do another one.

114
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,650

00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,390
>> Yeah, oh my god.

118
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,910
>> Now he's going underneath us now roll
right here he is.

119

Down here.
Roll right.

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,770
And a little back sticking; bring that
gunsight right to him, now.

121
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,634
>> Okay, we're going to do a go ballistic
here and just stall it.

124
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,290
>> You want this on film or not?

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,250
You want that barf bag on film or not?

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,960
Just go straight up, and we'll spin it
here.

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,900
We're going to spin, okay, just go
straight up, and beyond air speed here,

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,850
we'll just start a spin.

129
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,912
Okay?
Here we go.

130
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:44,090

131
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,640
>> Wahoo

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,670
>> We're going to skip the rest of this,
talking to Ralph.

133
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,530
Over here, she actually wants a picture of
it.

134
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,480
>> That okay?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,590
>> Oh yeah, about lost it for a second.

136
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,380
>> You were a good sport about it filling
the bag,

137
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,480
a lot of guys that do this have the ego
that they want to hide it,

138
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,630
they put it in their flight suit, they
don't want anybody to see it.

139
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,180
>> All for the good of the video.

140
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,450
>> Yeah, well we got a lot of it.

141
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,544
>> To two five left six mike echo.

142
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,525
[SOUND] [CROSSTALK] We survived our air
combat

143
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:28,800
USA experience,

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,500
some of us survived better than others.

145
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,980
I kind of lost my lunch a little bit up
there.

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,160
I don't usually get motion sickness, so I
don't know what that's about, but

147
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,890
I did experience those g-forces right
before I threw up.

148
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:48,070
And then, while I was recovering, Corey
was doing some unbelievable maneuvers.

149
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,120
>> Whoa!
That was insane.

150
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,990
That was probably the coolest thing I've
ever done.

151
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,640
My body's feeling all these strange sorts
of things, your visions coming in and out.

152
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,130
Like, ground and

153
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,660
air sort of this fluid concept where, it's
always changing over so.

154
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,140
Now, one thing I didn't expect is when we
got of the plane, I felt the wobbly.

155
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,100
Like, I really felt like I'd been on,

156
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,610
you know
>> Doing this.

157
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,810
>> I don't know, how long has it been?

158
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,430
Five minutes?

159
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,992
>> Yeah.
>> Finally kind of getting,

160
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:16,780
get my bearings.

161
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,390
>> Yeah, you actually looked more sick
when you got off than when

162
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,240
you were in the plane.

163
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,450
>> And I tell you what, man, it was like,
exactly like you read about.

164
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,720
Pull up, because like the g-forces start
getting stronger and stronger.

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,130
I feel the, my vision coming in a little
bit and

166
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,420
then it started to get a little fuzzy and
less color.

167
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,350
And then we pulled really hard and fast
and everything kind of went.

168
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,102
>> Yeah.
I only made it to about three and

169
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,280
a half Gs before I got sick and that was
incredible.

170
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,980
I can't imagine people who go up to seven
or nine Gs.

171
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,350
>> You're in a cockpit like capsule.

172
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,560
Take a drink of water and okay you’re
ready?

173
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,570
No, I’m not ready, I don’t ever want to do
that again, but, of course you go yeah.

174
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,610
>> The Air Force people, who have to,

175
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,150
they have to tolerate nine Gs before they
get in the F16s, it’s unbelievable.

176
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,190
>> It’s not like you go okay there’s 1g,
2gs, you know.

177
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,245
It’s like bang, you’re at 9Gs.

178
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:14,395
When they set it for nine, and

179
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:20,796
it's, it's really brutal.

180
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,480

>> So, who won the dogfight?

181
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,015
>> He clearly won just about everything.

182
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,995
[LAUGH]
>> Now, hold on, look at my elbow.

183
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,173
[NOISE]
>> Up high, down low.

184
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:31,284
Ready?

185
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:32,375
Oh, yeah.
