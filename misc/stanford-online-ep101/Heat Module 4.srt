00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,270
In this module, we're going to take a look
at how Corey fared in the heat.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,850
Did his hometown of Phoenix,

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,240
Arizona help him cope with those stressful
heated conditions?

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,960
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,500
First, a friendly reminder of what
questions we left you with at

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,530
the end of the Corey Gets Hot video.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,210
How did Corey's body cool down if the room
was warmer than his core temperature?

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,440
Why does putting his hands in cold water
help lower his core temperature so much?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,560
And why did Corey's heart rate stay
elevated well after exercise?

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,390
To my right, is a graph of Corey's core
temperature data as measured by

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,060
the esophageal probe over the course of
the experiment.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,600
There was a rapid rise in core temperature
during the set workload exercise.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,490
Remember that he was in a double-layered
charcoal suit that was semi-impermeable.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,070
The room was 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40
degrees centigrade.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,201
Within 20 minutes, his temperature went up
two degrees,

16
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,926
from 37.25 to 39.25 degrees centigrade.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,040
Then he got off the treadmill and there
was an initial fall in temperature as

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,050
we put on his additional coverage; gloves
on his hands, baggies on his feet, and

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,468
a ski mask.

20
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:16,260
In that scenario, we were able to clamp
his core temperature,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,980
because there was essentially no way for
him to dissipate his heat.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,480
You can see by the yellow line,

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,200
that his temperature remained stable
during that time.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,430
We then uncovered his head, his hands and
feet.

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,010
His core temperature began to fall again.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,050
Check out the light blue section of the
line on that graph.

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,630
Amazing.

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,020
So it seems intuitive that he would not be
able to lose heat when he

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,500
was completely covered up.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
But what about the first Corey question.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,130
How did he lose heat when he was
unclamped, and

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,589
the room was warmer than he was?

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,430
Well there's really only one option,
evaporation.

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,670
He was cooling the exposed skin areas
through evaporation.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,170
Converting liquid to gas requires the
input of energy.

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,450
That energy is drawn from the heat in the
surface of the skin that's

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,350
cooling the skin.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,650
And then he put his hands down in the cold
water, and

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,710
his temperature began to fall even more
rapidly, as indicated by the purple line.

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,150
And the second question.

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,350
Why did his temperature fall more rapidly
when he put his hands in the cool water?

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,330
By doing that, we provided him with an
external cold sink.

43
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,040
His body was sending hot blood down to his
hands,

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,530
where it came in contact with the cool
water, dumped some of the heat, and

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,410
brought the cooler blood back to the core.

46
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,460
If the water had been too cold, then it
would have caused localized

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,930
vasoconstriction, and the heat exchange
would not have been optimal.

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,060
However, when the temperature's in the
right range,

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,830
it can serve as an effective heat sink.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,800
It must have felt like such a relief for
poor Corey in that crazy outfit.

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,380
What a good sport he is, eh?

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,190
[LAUGH]

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,280
In this graph, Corey's heart rate data in
orange, is plotted against his

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
core temperature values in blue during
exercise and recovery.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
When he started exercising,

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,550
his heart rate went up from just over 90
beats per minute to around 160 initially.

57
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,630
You can see the access scale on your right
of the graph.

58
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,430
It then should have plateaued there for a
while, since it was a set workload.

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,180
However, you can see that his core
temperature continued to rise and

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,060
his heart rate did as well.

61
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,220
By then end of 20 minutes, his heart rate
was over 190 beats per minute.

62
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,750
Can you think back to why his heart rate
continued to rise?

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,650
Cardiovasuclar drift.

64
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,630
As he got hotter,

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,250
more blood was shunted to the peripherate
in an unsuccessful attempt to cool him.

66
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,836
So stroke volume was falling, and

67
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:45,780
heart rate was compensating in order to
keep cardiac output sufficiently high.

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,450
After exercise, Corey's heart rate fell as
expected, but rather than

69
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,270
approaching baseline, it remained elevated
around 150 beats per minute.

70
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,770
How come?

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,705
He was still hot.

72
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:00,260
[LAUGH] Have you ever had that experience
where you're just sitting somewhere on

73
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,030
a very hot day and your heart feels like
it's racing?

74
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,700
Your heart rate is elevated to try and

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,860
send more blood to the skin for cooling,
and trying to compensate for

76
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,030
the fall in stroke volume that we talked
about earlier.

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,890
In Corey's case, post-exercise, he was
also a little bit dehydrated.

78
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,500
Even though the sweat was not evaporating
through his suit,

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,380
he was still sweating up a storm, getting
quite wet inside his clothes.

80
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,490
After the whole event, he was down about 1
kilo or 2.2 pounds of water weight.

81
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,070
As you may recall, we also gave Corey a
cognitive function test before,

82
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,350
several times so that he could practice,
and

83
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,160
immediately after exercise during the heat
clamp portion of that study.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,540
The test, called the Tower of Hanoi,
requires problem solving by

85
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,360
moving disks around as fast as possible to
match a given pattern.

86
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,020
Corey showed no decrement in cognitive
function,

87
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,930
even a slight increase in his performance.

88
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,520
The data and the literature are mixed.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,300
But overall, it seems that cognitive
function is well maintained in the heat.

90
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,780
Initially, there is even a slight rise in
performance as people focus their

91
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,670
mental resources on a particular task.

92
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,350
Then there's a middle range of heat
stress,

93
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,390
where people can compensate with increased
focus on the cognitive activities.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,440
Once a decrement does start to occur, it
is exacerbated by the degree of

95
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,840
heat stress, the duration of exposure, and
the complexity of the task.

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,700
The relationship between those three
elements are combined in

97
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,550
the graph above my head.

98
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,679
Feel free to pause the video if you'd like
to take a longer look at the graph.

99
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,300
I hope you, now have a better sense of
what was going on with Corey in

100
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,640
the hot room.

101
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,040
Next we'll move on to what things you can
do to improve your experience, and

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,780
performance in the heat.

103
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,530
Major practical tips coming your way.

104
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,030
Thank you.
