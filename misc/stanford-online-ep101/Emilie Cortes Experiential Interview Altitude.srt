1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,520
>> The culmination of your efforts, the
feeling is just so

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,490
visceral, the sense of accomplishment.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,350
And, like, I can do anything if I've done
this.

4
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:14,490
>> Emilie Cortes is an avid high altitude
and glacier mountaineer.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,880
Her previous climbs include Makalu, Mt
Mckinley, Mt Rainier,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,110
Kilimanjaro, and Mexico and Ecuador
volcanoes, among many others.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,700
Emily runs an all-women's adventure travel
company called Call of

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,340
the Wild Adventures.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
She recently left her 17-year finance
career,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,370
where she managed $7 billion in assets, to
align her passion and vocation.

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,528
Empowering women through positive
experiences in the outdoors.

12
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:44,840
Although her previous career was
impressive, it is her life transition and

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,140
current role of inspiring women through
outdoor experiences that we

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,380
are interested in discussing today.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,460
So, Emilie, so excited to have you here
today.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,170
Thank you for agreeing to talk with us.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,940
>> Thank you for having me.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,240
>> Yes, and so we met while I was
preparing this class, and that is one of

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,840
the great perks of this class, is just
meeting very interesting people like you.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,590
And I was so inspired by your story of
this life transition that you

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,230
made from a very lucrative corporate job
into these outdoor adventures.

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,190
Can you share your experience on how that
transition took place?

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,400
>> Sure, and first I'm like flattered to
have anybody call me interesting,

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,585
because I still think of myself as little
old me.

25
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:27,920
[LAUGH] But that may be a, a theme
throughout all of my story.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
So I basically went into finance because I
didn't have a lot of family or

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,220
a lot of support and I was super driven
and super focused and

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,040
just wanted to do something that was
lucrative in order to take care of myself.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,400
And I was pretty good at it, and I enjoyed
my clients and my relationships and

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,020
I'm good at math, but in the end, I just
wasn't feeling super fulfilled.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,070
And there are a lot of demands and aspects
of the corporate world that had

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,620
become more and more unsavory to me as I
got older.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,330
When I was about 30 or so, I just kind of
fell into climbing, and

34
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,530
I'd never really considered myself an
athletic person before.

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,720
I was always kind of the, the slowest one,
or the last one picked for dodgeball.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,285
Actually I remember I would like, try to
hide and skip PE a lot.

37
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,690
[LAUGH] But I, I totally fell into
climbing, and

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,070
that's a whole nother story in and of
itself, but

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,170
I found that if I prepared, and I did a
lot of the things that were really re,

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,490
required especially in high altitude,
which is to go slow on purpose.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,100
To be body aware, to be disciplined, that
I was actually pretty darn good at it.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,940
And it really kind of shocked me that I
could be good at something that was so

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,700
physically demanding.

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,340
So along the way I very slowly and
methodically acquired skills.

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,100
I really understood that there was danger
in this activity and

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,380
I didn't want to get myself killed.

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,400
So, I also then began to lead trips.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,070
And that was a really big growth
experience for

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,450
me, to take the responsibility of others
in the back country, and

50
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,780
actually believe that I had the ability to
do that.

51
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,044
But along the, the way with that, I would
see with these co-ed groups that I

52
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,053
would lead, the guys would kind of come in
with a lot of confidence, and

53
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,909
they would acquire the skills, and they
would be appreciative and

54
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,760
they would leave with a lot of confidence.

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,050
And, you know, making generalizations of
course.

56
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,050
But, the women would usually come in and

57
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,130
have a lot less confidence, be worried
would they be able to hack the cold,

58
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,010
would they be a burden, could they really
do this.

59
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,660
And then when they did, because they
pretty much always would and

60
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,850
were capable, especially with some
coaching and

61
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,840
guidance, they would just practically be
transformed as people.

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
And I've heard, heard gals say things
like,

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,570
nothing in the office is going to seem
hard now because I did this thing.

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,200
And that's the transformational aspect
where I feel like I'm

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,870
having real impact on real people and
that's so

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,020
much more meaningful for me and I made the
plunge to make that my full time job.

67
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,040
>> Very daring.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,680
So, when you take these women out, do they
come back for more or is it, sort of,

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,450
one experience that they have and they
have this confidence and then that's over?

70
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,500
>> No, they usually keep coming back for
more.

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,560
I mean, it's almost an addicting thing and
whether, you know,

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,850
a five mile hike is hard for you or

73
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,040
backpacking the top of Mount Whitney is
hard for you but within your abilities.

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,660
You go, wow, you know, I see the results
of having worked hard, of having a goal.

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,836
Like, I'm also way more motivated by,

76
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:25,292
you know, climbing Denali, than I am
looking good in a bikini,

77
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,650
to actually be consistent with my own
workouts and training.

78
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,200
But, there's just something different
about when you get to

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,160
the top of the mountain.

80
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,210
And it's like the entire world expands
before your feet.

81
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,660
And all these hours, and all of the
prioritization and all the hard work, and

82
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,220
even potentially, and I may be now, you
know, tell it, not great marketing for

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,030
my company, but there's sometimes a little
suffering involved right?

84
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,470
[LAUGH] You work through that, and then
it's like, the culmination of

85
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,750
your efforts, the feeling's just so
visceral, the sense of accomplishment.

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,620
And, like, I can do anything if I've done
this.

87
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,010
>> So you've been on both co-ed trips, and
maybe even led co-ed trips, and

88
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,420
then all women trips.

89
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,110
So how do they differ in their feelings,
between those two groups of people?

90
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,110
>> Yeah, they're quite different.

91
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,510
Actually shockingly different, in a few
ways.

92
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,950
One is, sometimes I feel like I have to be
a little gentle with the male ego.

93
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,500
So, if a guy's trying to redirect
something that I want to do,

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,560
I have to really acknowledge them and make
sure they don't feel threatened, and

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,970
then do what I'm going to do anyways.

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,970
Some of that, just, the gender dynamic is
gone with an all female group.

97
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,200
But the thing that really struck me the
most when I started leading all female

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,300
groups, was that there were women in the
leadership, and there were no men around.

99
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,333
And like, my guide, my partner in Nepal,
says to me, he's like, what do

100
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,378
you mean there are no men on your trips,
what happens if something goes wrong.

101
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:56,950
And it's like, well, we, we figure it out?

102
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,350
And I feel like it's this reflection of
the corporate world, as well.

103
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,030
When you look around, and it's mostly
white male, and

104
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,770
it's starting to change, but most of my
career it has been.

105
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,500
There's something that becomes very deeply
engrained in you that,

106
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,900
that's how it should be.

107
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,800
They, they, those who are not like you
should be in charge.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,590
And when it's people who are like you,
it's other women or

109
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,130
ideally, women of color as well and you're
coming up behind them.

110
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,450
You're going, of course I can do that.

111
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,000
Because I'm, I'm like them.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,520
So it's really a different feeling when
you're in the back country,

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,980
it's all women, you're making your own
decisions,

114
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,970
you're dealing with the situations that
will inevitably arise.

115
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,270
And you go, yeah, of course we can do
this.

116
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,895
Maybe we're even better?

117
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,390
>> [CROSSTALK]

118
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,900
So, did you consider yourself a leader
before you started doing this?

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,470
>> No, not at all.

120
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,350
No I, I even have a talk I give I call the
leadership bone about how I

121
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,230
didn't have a leadership bone in my body
or so, so I believed.

122
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,050
I was super shy when I was growing up,
completely terrified of authority and

123
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,320
all I knew how to do was put my head down
and study and get good grades.

124
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,340
it, climbing really was what changed me
the most.

125
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,280
So, being out there and making decisions
and slowly, and

126
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,530
carefully, not biting off to much at
first.

127
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,280
Not going on a double black diamond run on
your first time skiing out, you know.

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,800
I realized, like, wow I actually have a
capacity for making good decisions and

129
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,010
people are resonating with me, and they're
listening, and in fact they may

130
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,810
even be inspired by me, because I've
worked hard to prepare, and I'm small.

131
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,070
And I don't have the build that one would
expect a climber would have.

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,430
And they go, wow, you know, maybe, maybe
she really knows what she's talking about.

133
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,840
It's, there's something different about if
it's a 6 foot 5 guy, who's really big, and

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,890
he's like, you can do it, and

135
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,700
you're like I don't, I'm still not really
sure if I can do it.

136
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,520
But when I say it, they seem to believe
it.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,670
And it took a while to get comfortable
with that aspect of thinking about

138
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,890
oneself with leadership capacity.

139
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,760
And I also think that's something women
may struggle with more than men.

140
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,920
But eventually, the ability to impact
others outweighed any

141
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,370
doubt that I had in myself as a leader.

142
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:11,910
>> Mm.

143
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,250
So what kind of training did you go
through to get to that point,

144
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,560
to be able to lead your own trips.

145
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,250
>> Oh, experience.

146
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,690
Just lots of experience.

147
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,870
I've led a lot of trips,

148
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,740
I led a lot of different group sizes,
things where I've done it before and

149
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,250
I was just going back and leading,
something I was comfortable with.

150
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,810
I've led a number of trips where I've
never been before, so

151
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,160
I'm figuring it out on the fly, while
giving other people confidence.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,370
And my ability to make sure things don't
go wrong.

153
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,840
But yeah, it's really just getting out
there and doing it.

154
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,320
I mean yeah, there's leadership courses,
and I read outdoor leadership,

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,220
by I forgot his name, Graham something
it's a [INAUDIBLE] book, and

156
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,405
there's sierra club leadership, and I did
the wilderness first responder.

157
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:55,190
That's a ten hour, ten day course that
really prepares you for

158
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,280
medical scenarios in the back country, and
all of that helps.

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,380
But I think it's like just getting out and
doing it, and being even open.

160
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,085
I always solicit feedback on how I can be
a better leader.

161
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,450
>> Mm-hm.
>> People will say like,

162
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,690
you need to step it up and be a little
more autocratic.

163
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,310
Or on this one, we all kind of know what
we're doing.

164
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,040
Consensus would be a little bit more
appropriate.

165
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,450
So I'm super open for that kind of
feedback.

166
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,320
Because I want people to feel comfortable.

167
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,270
I want our objectives to be met, and

168
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,340
I want it to be done in a way that's safe
and enjoyable.

169
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,400
>> And have you had your moments,

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,570
I'm sure, where you've been there
thinking, wow.

171
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,910
Am I really the right person for this?

172
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,580
Are you, you doubting your judgement on a
certain situation?

173
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,625
>> Honestly, not really.

174
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,550
>> [LAUGH] Good for you.

175
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,480
>> I think it's also because I'm so
deliberate about what I step up for.

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,130
And I try not to go beyond my limits when
I'm in a leadership capacity.

177
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm usually really trying to lead things
that are below my limits.

178
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,600
When I go and do thing personally, I'm
pushing the limits and

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,430
then sometimes I'm like, thank goodness
I'm not in charge of anybody else

180
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,430
here because I can barely take care of
myself.

181
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,500
But that may be part of why I haven't put
myself in a leadership situation where I

182
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,770
really thought I couldn't handle it.

183
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,500
>> So speaking of those situations where
you're pushing your own limits.

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,130
>> Mm, yes.
>> So what, first of all,

185
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,360
what's the, the accomplishments you're
most proud of?

186
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,900
In terms of climbing, or, being outside.

187
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,810
>> I would say, a lot of stories revolve
around my experience of MaKalu,

188
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,840
which is one of the 8,000 meter peaks.

189
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,815
There's 14 8,000 meter peaks in the world,
that's around 25-26,000 feet.

190
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:30,753
And it's a really small group of people
that actually want to try and climb them.

191
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,520
Especially those that want to try and

192
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,809
climb the 8,000 meter peaks that aren't
Everest, because you get no glory for it.

193
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:41,240
They're mostly mu, much more difficult,
even if they're just a little bit lower.

194
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,480
So Makalu is the fifth highest mountain
the world, and I had kind

195
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,730
of a once in a lifetime opportunity to
jump on an expedition in between two jobs.

196
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,920
I had not trained at all.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,320
And normally I will train like five or six
months like a maniac to

198
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,370
do something even like McKinley Denali,
which is 20,320 feet high.

199
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,220
But I basically went there with the goal
of learning as much as I could and

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,260
not getting myself killed.

201
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,355
And, I thought if I can summit it'll be a
huge coup.

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,980
And just going there with such a small
team, there were four of us total.

203
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,610
Everyone else had climbed at least one
other 8,000 meter peak, if not, more.

204
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,120
So I was kind of the, the newbie along for

205
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,790
the ride and very conscious of my position
there, trying not to be a burden or

206
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,310
ask too many questions and also be a
contributor to the team,

207
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,450
which was challenging in such an extreme
environment.

208
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,530
But, I ended up making it up to Camp Two.

209
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,300
And even slept at Camp Two, which, you
know,

210
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,260
is a big difference between just tagging a
new altitude and sleeping there.

211
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,470
And did fantastically well with altitude.

212
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,430
Like, floored myself with it.

213
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,460
It still is, like the hardest thing I've
ever done.

214
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,490
And walking across maybe half football
field of,

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,410
of flat terrain to get to the camp, took
almost an hour.

216
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,430
And that's just, it's really hard to
describe how

217
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,470
hard [CROSSTALK]
>> That's amazing.

218
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,120
>> It is when you have to take a step and

219
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,700
like take a few breaths just to take
another flat step.

220
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,740
But no, no AMS and really felt like,

221
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,440
oh my god, I might actually be able to do
this thing.

222
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,430
And then, we got shut down by the weather
and

223
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,810
this is part of the 8,000 meter peak game,
there's a lot of waiting,

224
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,430
there's a lot of trying to find a weather
window that will work.

225
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,920
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

226
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,040
And we then ended up leaving without
launching another summit, so it was kind

227
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,030
of a bummer but it's, it is the experience
of climbing a mountain like that.

228
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,450
>> So you say you do pretty well at
altitude, right?

229
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,130
So you had no AMS, how did you accomplish
that?

230
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,960
Did you have a very slow ascent?

231
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,950
>> Well, I think there's a few aspects
about dealing with altitude.

232
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,370
Or, I like to say there are four things
that determine how you're going to

233
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,020
do at altitude.

234
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,620
One is your genetics, so I clearly have
pretty good genetics.

235
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,220
One's your own personal fitness.

236
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,360
So the more fit I am, the better I do, the
less I'll struggle.

237
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,460
And I wasn't super fit, but I was, you
know, pretty decent.

238
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,770
Another is your personal care, how much
you're paying attention to your pace,

239
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,010
you're hydrating, you're eating, you're
not ascending too quickly,

240
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,040
these things that are in your control.

241
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,240
And then the fourth is randomness.

242
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,350
So there are the most experienced climbers
in the world that

243
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,630
will come down with pulmonary edema like
after 17 years of guiding on Denali.

244
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,510
So you just never know and

245
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,750
you have to be aware that that can happen
and to listen to yourself.

246
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,880
So, I think, in this case it really was
just the acclimatization program works.

247
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,330
You climb high, you sleep low, you rest
for three or four days, you wait for

248
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,150
another window, you go up, you tag that
previous camp and you sleep high again and

249
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,570
you come all the way back down and you
recover yet again.

250
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,720
And as you get higher and higher you can
start to feel how it really is

251
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,390
impacting your body, and I'm just lucky
that I don't suffer,

252
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,940
that I don't get nausea, I don't throw up,
I don't get splitting headaches.

253
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,900
But I do get super exerted, so I,
everything just feels really hard.

254
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,010
And like that, you know, taking an hour to
go half a football field.

255
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,200
My, my partner was already at the tent,
and like basically watching me.

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,050
The struggle across.

257
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,160
But then he's got, you know, nausea and

258
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,890
a terrible headache so then I, you know,
basically end up taking care of

259
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,240
a lot of the people around me even though
I'm much slower than they are.

260
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,430
So I think there may also be something to
the fact that I have to go slow.

261
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,940
And I'm, I, I worry more about the people
that are triathletes and

262
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,270
marathoners that come on my trips because
they don't respect altitude and

263
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,150
they only have this one gear that's
pushing really hard.

264
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,670
And if you push really hard, you have to
recover.

265
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,640
And at altitude, your recovery is severely
compromised and

266
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,100
the next day, you have to get up and do
the same thing and maybe go even higher.

267
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,220
And I just seemed like I can only operate
in this one gear, and

268
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,920
it's a pretty slow gear.

269
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,750
And I can suck it up and get it done.

270
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,590
And, I just don't feel bad when I do it
that way.

271
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,810
>> Yeah, and in fact you brought a little
device in here.

272
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,755
>> Yes.
>> Oxygen stat meter which you use

273
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:06,730
regularly.

274
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,040
And so, probably if you were to measure
yourself,

275
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,320
when you were walking very slowly across
that football field.

276
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,070
You might have had higher satch than your
partner who just scurried across and

277
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,910
dropped it down, and that may have given
him the headache,

278
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,630
because his satch might have been lower at
that point.

279
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,900
So that, slowing down, is actually a good
strategy I think.

280
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,840
>> Yeah, and interestingly, I'm like one
of the only people who carries this

281
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,260
around, but I really want to know.

282
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,770
It's a data point, I don't rely completely
on it, but

283
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,540
in the context of where we are, what the
ascent profile has been, how I feel.

284
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,700
If I experienced oxygen saturation of 69%,
I felt really bad.

285
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,980
And just seeing that number knowing that I
wasn't like, 83 and

286
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,100
I feel really bad, but at 69 like, I knew
okay, I have to take this seriously.

287
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,980
I'm in trouble.

288
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,700
Although, I had to direct my own care,
which is also kind of scary because

289
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,170
you can go down pretty quickly when you're
that low.

290
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,330
So, yeah I, I feel like it's just such a
lightweight, it's only, they're only like

291
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,740
30 or 40 bucks, like a great tool to have
if you are in the altitu, altitude arena.

292
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,250
Yeah.

293
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,000
>> And do you like being alone in the
mountains or

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,390
do you prefer to always have other people
around?

295
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,060
I've talked to other women in particular
that seem to like that sort of isolation,

296
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,990
and that solitude.

297
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,610
>> It depends.

298
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:25,300
It sort of feels like, like graduating to
be able to be comfortable,

299
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,200
or have the confidence that you can do it
alone.

300
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,090
So, in the beginning, and

301
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,720
this is part of why a lot of people, a lot
of women come on my trips.

302
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
They don't want to be alone, they're not
sure,

303
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,850
they want somebody else to help, hold
their hand, ask, answer their questions.

304
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,790
And you graduate to where, okay, you're
leading other people.

305
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,800
But you still have that camaraderie, and

306
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,660
I even tell people like my, you know, my
issue is, I'm a little hypoglycemic.

307
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,690
If I ever start getting really cranky, or

308
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,430
I bonk, like this is how you need to help
me your guide.

309
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,150
And that's pretty much the only thing that
will come up.

310
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,938
Give me some food and I'll be, get a lot
nicer.

311
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:02,760
[LAUGH]
but going solo just takes it

312
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,400
to a whole another level, where you're
like, I feel like I can do this.

313
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,360
It's still going to be scary.

314
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,160
The hardest part's being alone with your
own self talk.

315
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,390
And not having anyone else to say, I'm
worried about this.

316
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,840
And I say oh, don't worry, it'll be fine,
we'll get there in time.

317
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,290
No, you're just worried about it.

318
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,640
And there's no way to resolve that on your
own.

319
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,870
The other thing that's

320
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,930
really, fulfilling about doing it alone is
challenging people's perceptions.

321
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,020
So, when I've climbed Shasta alone, or
when I did Mount Whitney,

322
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,180
backpacked around the backside alone, the
shock, the absolute shock and

323
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,530
horror that a woman was traveling in the
back country alone.

324
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,180
And the guys traveling alone, they don't
get that at all.

325
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,700
So there's this interesting like constant
reinforcement that you're not supposed to

326
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,450
be doing this.

327
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,030
Or you should be scared by doing this.

328
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,020
And it feels very empowering to directly
challenge that societal norm,

329
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,790
that women would not be out alone doing
things that are kind of scary.

330
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,390
>> Hm.
So what advice would you give people,

331
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,530
women in particular, who are considering
doing something like this for

332
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,079
the first time?

333
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,720
>> I'd say just go for it.

334
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,860
We hold ourselves back a lot out of fear,
and think we can't do things,

335
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,820
and are afraid of even the potential of a
little bit of suffering like feeling out

336
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,780
of breath, the uncomfortable situation of
being the last one in the group,

337
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,360
like we go, I'm not even going to try.

338
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,290
And, there's the corollary of like, bite
off what you can chew.

339
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:46,146
If you've never been hiking before, go do
some easy day hikes, don't go to Makalu.

340
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:49,430
But, I'd say, just, just try it.

341
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,220
You know, sign up for a trip, call
somebody and say this is what I can do,

342
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,680
is this appropriate for me, and if they
think so, don't hold yourself back.

343
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,580
Just go for it.

344
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,500
I mean, I like to tell people that, I tell
my

345
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,770
story about these crazy experiences in the
mountains so they can learn from it,

346
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,370
and they don't have to go as far as I did
to get it through my own thick skull.

347
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,150
But, when I come back from these trips.

348
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,228
My perspective is completely shifted,
where I'm not longer afraid of

349
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:25,910
managing $7 billion, which is a pretty
intimidating thing to do.

350
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,840
Some people are scared to death of doing
presentations, and

351
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,610
what's the worst thing that happens?

352
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,510
You don't do so well, nobody remembers it
in a year.

353
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,980
So in my, my thinking has really shifted
about.

354
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,250
If I take this risk in the mountains,
there could be loss of life or injury.

355
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,616
And then I come back and I go, if I take
this risk in this safe,

356
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:48,792
civilized world that we have, maybe I can
get that job.

357
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:52,439
Maybe I can get that date like what,
whatever it is.

358
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:56,180
Like, there's really only upside, so
that's what I think.

359
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,400
Just.

360
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,030
You know, be smart about it, but go for
it.

361
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,980
>> That's great advice.

362
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,110
And any last words of wisdom on any topic
that you'd like to

363
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,670
share with our viewing audience?

364
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,970
>> I'd say, just don't hold yourself back.

365
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,470
I mean, you can't see how small I am, but
I'm 5 foot 1, and

366
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,750
when you see me with these other people
that are climbing, they just.

367
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,970
They can't believe I can do what I do, and
I'm really not that fit.

368
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,130
I work really hard, I try to be smarter, I
have to make up for

369
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,540
the fact that I don't have a lot of, just,
natural athletic gifts.

370
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,170
But I don't hold myself back, I still say
this is what I want, and

371
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,020
I'm going to do it to the best of my
ability.

372
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,668
So that's, that's one other of my things,
like, take the risk,

373
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:43,881
be smart about it but, take the risk and
then just don't hold yourself back.

374
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,251
>> That's a great place to end.

375
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,686
Thank you so much for your time Emilie
it's great talking with you.

376
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:48,276
>> Thank you.

377
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:49,327
Thanks for having me.
