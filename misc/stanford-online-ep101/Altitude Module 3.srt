1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,870
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,300
In this module, you will learn about the
initial things that take place within

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,720
the first few hours of altitude exposure.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,390
Imagine you drive or fly to the top of a
mountain, or

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,140
you get sealed into an altitude chamber
like Corey did at 10,000 feet.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,610
Your body would say, ack, what happened to
all the oxygen?

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,110
You would experience a stress response
whether you liked it or

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,750
not, and in this case that is a good
thing,

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,930
because it is going to help to get more
oxygen to your tissues.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,860
The first thing your body will do in
response to low oxygen is try to

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,940
get more oxygen into your arterial blood.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,120
The easiest way to do that is to breathe
more.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,810
So you're resting and submax ventilation
goes up.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,570
This is good because it keeps in your
alveoli higher.

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,940
As the oxygen gets pulled into the
arterial blood, if you are ventilating

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,250
more it is quickly replaced with new air
that has more oxygen in it.

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,500
However, there are some problems with the
increased ventilation rate as well.

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,050
As you breathe more the carbon dioxide
that is in your lungs gets blown off and

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,880
that draws CO2 out of the blood.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,940
A decrease of CO2 in the blood is a signal
to slow breathing.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,880
Thus it is a negative feedback on
ventilation which is counter

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,260
productive and can result in blood oxygen
levels that are less than optimal.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,370
This can increase the risk of acute
mountain sickness or AMS.

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,050
Ventilation is stimulated by both low O2
and high CO2 levels in the blood.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,070
So those people who respond more to the O2
levels and

26
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,210
less to the CO2 levels, are at a lower
risk of getting AMS.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Blowing off more CO2 can also make the
blood more alkalotic or

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,680
basic, the opposite of acidic.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
This will shift the oxyhemoglobin curve to
the left,

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,300
which inhibits the unloading of oxygen in
the tissues.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,180
Although, it is a small effect,

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,810
you don't want to compromise an already
limited oxygen delivery.

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,940
Your body also responds by trying to get
more oxygen to the tissues,

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,280
by increasing blood flow.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,830
If you look at our friendly Fick equation
at the bottom of the slide, you can see

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,580
that oxygen consumption can be impacted
both by putting more oxygen in the A, or

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,200
arteriole blood, or by sending more blood
around to the tissues.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,619
So resting and submaximal exercise heart
rate increases.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,750
Blood pressure also increases to send more
blood to the tissues, lung, and brain.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,410
This improves profusion or

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,680
the distribution of blood into the
tissues, but it also puts you at risk for

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,090
high altitude pulmonary edema and high
altitude cerebral edema.

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,119
We'll talk more about HAPE and HACE in one
of the later modules.

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,350
What I've already described is part of the
stress response.

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,910
But the stress response is mediated by the
sympathetic nervous system,

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,540
which is responsible for the fight or
flight reaction.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,820
Stimulation of the SNS results in the
release of the Catecholamine hormones,

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,910
epinephrine and nor-epinephrine.

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,100
Otherwise called adrenaline and
nor-adrenaline.

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,700
Catecholamines help increase heart rate,
blood pressure and ventilation.

51
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,900
In addition, they cause you to use more
carbohydrate,

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,860
abbreviated as CHO on the slide, as fuel.

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,870
That is good because you get more energy
per unit oxygen for

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,640
carbohydrate than other fuels.

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,420
But it is bad because carbohydrate supply
is limited in your body.

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,630
Also, as part of the increase breakdown of
carbohydrate,

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,210
more lactate will accumulate in the blood
for a given workload.

58
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,320
The concept is illustrated with a little
diagram at the bottom of the slide.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,160
When you are rapidly breaking down your
two forms of carbohydrate in the body,

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,250
glycogen and your glucose, not all of the
pyruvate form can be used, so

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,250
some spins off in the form of lactate.

62
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,605
Although lactate is not the bad apple many
people think, it is an indicator of

63
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,389
non-steady-state conditions, or a
disruption of homeostasis.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,420
People who reside in high-altitude regions
know that

65
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,660
a little sympathetic stimulation is good
for altitude acclimatization.

66
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,880
That's why when you get off the plane in
La Paz,

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,090
Bolivia, at about 4,000 meters, they give
you cocoa leaf tea.

68
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,220
It is a stimulant like caffeine, that is
supposed to jump start

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,155
the acclimatization process and reduce the
risk of AMS.

70
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:29,020
The bottom line is that the responses I

71
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,030
just described will help compensate during
rest and submaximal exercise, but

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,380
you will reach your maximum capacity at a
lower work level.

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,230
If you think about it, that makes sense,
right?

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,510
You have an upper limit to your heart
rate.

75
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,720
If at it, if it is elevated at each work
load,

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,260
you won't be able to go as hard before you
reach your maximum heart rate.

77
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,180
Let's look at how all of this impacted
Corey in the chamber.

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,300
Fortunately for us, Corey was a textbook
case.

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,045
Nice work, Cory.

80
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:05,180
[LAUGH] The data I am about to discuss
compares his sea level

81
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,840
bike test with his 10,000 foot simulated
altitude bike test in the chamber.

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,750
First look right above my head, at his
maximum work and oxygen consumption.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,790
At sea level,

84
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,020
he reached 325 watts on the bike with a
VO2 with 50 mills per kilogram per minute.

85
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,250
At altitude, he only reached 275 watts
with a VO2 of

86
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,980
45 mills per kilogram per minute.

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,170
So, a fall of ten percent.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,790
Now look at his ventilation data in the
top graph.

89
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,330
Just what we would expect.

90
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,540
For a given work load, which is displayed
on the x or horizontal axis.

91
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,730
And all the way up to the point of fatigue
his ventilation was noticeably higher.

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,200
His arterial oxygen saturation displayed
in the lower graph was significantly

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,030
higher at sea level and stayed essentially
stable throughout exercise as expected.

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,190
In contrast his altitude saturation was
lower at the start, and

95
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,730
then fell off even more as exercise
intensity increased.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,410
The fall off during the higher intensity
has to do with the decreasing transit time

97
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,070
of the blood in the lungs as cardiac
output increases.

98
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,170
Remember in the earlier module, we talked
about how the lower driving force of

99
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,580
the gas at altitude means slower diffusion
through the lungs and

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,600
thus greater desaturation of the blood,
blood as it moves faster.

101
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,270
Like ventilation, both heart rate and
perceived exertion, so, how hard he

102
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,550
felt he was working, were both elevated
for a given work load at altitude.

103
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,760
Now you should have enough information to
answer the questions we left you

104
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,550
with at the end of the story video.

105
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,910
How did Corey compensate for the lower O2
availability at altitude?

106
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,150
What stopped Corey at a lower workload
during exercise at altitude?

107
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,720
And did Corey do better or worse than
predicted change for 10,000 feet?

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,690
You'll see a couple of these questions on
the practice quiz and

109
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,000
maybe the other a little later.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,700
So make sure you can answer all of them
After the quiz,

111
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,210
we have a special treat for you, another
Corey video.

112
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,580
This one is up on Pikes Peak and there is
farting and peeing involved, so

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,770
you wont want to miss it.

114
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,100
It will be the talk of the discussion
sections, no doubt.

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,600
Enjoy.
