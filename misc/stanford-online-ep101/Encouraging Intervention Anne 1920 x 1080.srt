1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,010
Finally ready to start.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,360
Woo hoo!

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,600
This class is a culmination of many
factors in my history such as

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,860
storytelling and science, teaching,
research, and even cocktail party chat.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,580
And of course, the fates were kind when
they put Corey in

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,500
my Stamford class at this critical
juncture.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,090
This online course would definitely not
look as it does today without him,

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,590
both for reasons on camera and behind the
scenes.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,180
There are a lot of other people that made
this class possible,

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,520
including our producers, Carlos Saligo and

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,090
Wes Choi, our intern, Lexi Ross, and our
scientific advisory committee.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,060
I want to thank the Program in Human
Biology, the Office of

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,530
the Vice Provost for Online Learning and
the Dean's Office of Humanities and

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,840
Sciences for their financial support and
encouragement of our efforts.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,340
And finally, I want to thank you for

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,050
being a part of this class, we wouldn't be
here without you.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,075
We are so excited to start.

18
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,210
[LAUGH] We hope you are too.

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,790
Get online, learn, and then go outside and
use your newfound knowledge.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,290
Have fun.
