[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,250
What a journey we've had together.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,760
Lets take a little walk down memory lane.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,320
You joined us on a voyage across the
United States into the depths of the human

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,840
body where we gained an appreciation of
how the body responds to cold, heat,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,310
aging, stress, altitude and variable
pressure.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,560
You visited us here on Stanford's campus
where we dunked Corey in

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,590
the water tanks and then heated him back
up again.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,050
You got to travel to MIT,

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,140
where we wandered the streets of Cambridge
in the Agnes suit.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,140
You got to see me throw myself out of an
airplane for the good of science, and

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,220
you were soothed by Corey's calming voice,
talking about stress and relaxation.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,170
And let's not forget our adventures in the
mountains of Colorado and

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,880
flying planes in Livermore, California.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,190
Phew.

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,580
We got to go all over the place and have a
lot of fun doing it.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,820
But what really made the journey special
was that you joined us,

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,860
sharing your interesting insights and
different perspectives on

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,920
the material from around the world through
the discussion forums.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,280
>> And when you started joining our class,

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,250
you really joined us from all over the
world.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,230
We were looking at participants starting
to register at, Kundelis registered from

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,240
Lithuania and, and Fenna from Germany, and
Michiyuki from Hong Kong, Mohamed from

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,080
Egypt, Wilson from Scotland, and then
Croatia and then Russia, South Africa,

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,400
Indonesia and our backyard, San Fransisco,
back over to France, Pakistan, Columbia.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,410
You really came from, from all over the
world to participate in this journey.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,440
Even down to Fred, from our own backyard
in Palo Alto, California.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,360
And let's not forget, let, let us not
forget about you from your own hometown.

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,850
You all joined together,

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,840
through your computers, to share this
experience with us.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,090
It was so exciting when you started to
introduce yourself.

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,960
That first post that came through.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,980
We were live, and then they started to
flood in from all over the world.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,260
>> Yeah, and, one of the highlights of the
first couple of days was the Titanic post,

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,810
combining my favorite movie with
physiology.

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,700
I didn't know something so beautiful could
happen.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,740
>> Yeah.

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,306
And then you all start falling in love
with Corey.

39
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,650
He's so cute [LAUGH].

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,610
His voice is so soothing.

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,045
>> She loves to embarrass me.

42
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,470
>> [LAUGH] And, we want to hear more from
Corey.

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,440
Yeah, thank you a lot for that one, by the
way [LAUGH].

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,816
>> Yeah, well let us not forget all about
all the middle aged men who

45
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,300
were attractive to Dr. Friedlander.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,600
>> How do you know they're middle aged?

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,606
>> And her curvy intellect.

48
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:26,150
>> [LAUGH] Curvy intellect.

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,210
>> [LAUGH] Well setting that aside we had
some bumps along the way

50
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,639
technical issues for example, and I have a
confession to make.

51
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,370
Some of those technical issues you may
have encountered were my responsibility,

52
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,180
so sorry about that.

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,590
And thanks for the, thanks for

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,190
the feedback so that we could correct it
as soon as possible.

55
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,360
But we were all making mistakes.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,596
At least you didn't miscalculate the
conversion from meters to feet [LAUGH].

57
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:52,886
That was kind of embarrassing, and

58
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:56,230
then I really emphasized it just to make
sure that everyone would notice.

59
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,540
But we fixed that.

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,230
>> Yeah.
>> So it was a little chaotic for

61
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,820
us here and there behind the scenes, but
overall, for

62
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,045
our first online class, I think it went
pretty well.

63
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:04,950
>> Mm-hm.

64
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,680
>> We also received so many wonderful
comments from all of you.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,919
Even when we messed up, you were kind in
the way that you pointed it out.

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,570
At the end of the day, the thing that
excites us the most is the opportunity to

67
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,380
share our passion about learning and

68
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,400
physiology with you, to awaken that
lifelong learner inside.

69
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,870
So we'd like to propose a toast to all of
you who have taken the class.

70
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,750
Here's to you.

71
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,820
You made it, through the good, the bad,
the highs of the mountains and

72
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,090
the lows of underwater, the annoyance of
the check-all-that-apply questions.

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,930
You did it.

74
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,120
We toast to your supreme efforts.

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,750
Cheers.

76
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,480
>> Cheers.

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,980
Clink.

78
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,350
You did it.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,410
I suppose this is our final goodbye, and
my last chance to thank you for

80
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,190
the amazing opportunity that I feel like
we all had to share this time together.

81
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,180
I learned so much.

82
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,010
It's contributed a great deal to my life.

83
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,960
And I really hope that you can walk away
from your experience with us

84
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,915
with a couple of things that it added to
your life too.

85
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,780
Cheers.

86
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,645
>> Cheers.

87
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:17,400
[SOUND]
Bye.

88
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,950
[INAUDIBLE]
Before I sign off as well,

89
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,710
I just want to repeat the theme of the
class for you one last time because I

90
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,200
believe it is so important that you leave
with this message.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
Your body is awesome.

92
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,170
Learn about it, appreciate it, take it out
for a test spin periodically to

93
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,740
see what it can do, and most of all, treat
it with respect.

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,570
It works hard for

95
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,420
you every day to help you experience the
world around you in the best possible way.

96
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,930
Do what you can to keep it healthy and
strong.

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:58,197
It's been a great journey.

98
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:06,123
We'll miss you.

99
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,953
Bye.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

104
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,503
You did it.

105
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:48,060
We toast to your supreme efforts.

106
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,560
Cheers.

108
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,560
>> No, you're supposed to drink.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,225
>> Oh, geez.

110
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:58,083
>> [LAUGH] You're supposed to drink, and
then.

111
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,120
>> Okay.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,388
Okay.
We should do that over again.

113
