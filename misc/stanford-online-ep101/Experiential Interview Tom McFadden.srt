1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,650
I'm excited for your students to get to
experience this class.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,080
>> Tom McFadden is a Stanford graduate in
human biology,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,870
he is passionate about science.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,030
He has combined his love of music,
storytelling and science to create online

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,730
rap videos that have attracted online
viewers from around the world.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,198
His interests have let him to outreach
work in New Zealand and

7
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:27,170
the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in Mexico.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,500
Tom McFadden has a Masters of Science
Communication and is Fullbright scholar.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,150
He is now an eighth grade biology teacher
at the Nueva School.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,410
His videos have created a new opportunity
for

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,870
students to express their passion about
science.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,470
For those reasons and many others it's a
great honor to now turn to our

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,990
experiential interview in science
communication with Tom McFadden.

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,050
Tom, it's great to be here with you today
and thanks for coming down.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,320
>> Yeah, thanks for having me, I'm very
excited about what you're doing.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,810
>> Yeah, we're excited too.

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,950
So, I thought the great place to start
today with you Tom,

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,830
would be with your story about how it all
got started.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,510
How did you, how did you begin this, this
journey of science, story and rapping?

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,680
>> Well worked at a summer camp for

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,170
my buddy, asked me to start making some
songs about milkshakes.

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,410
Started performing live.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,500
This is right after I graduated and I kind
of discovered my love of

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,040
making goofy songs about stuff that were,
aren't a lot of songs about.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,050
When I started teaching human biology it
was very natural fit.

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,200
There was a lecture about RIMs
reproductive isolating mechanisms, and

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,490
there was a lot of songs about rims that
already existed.

28
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,590
>> Pretty convenient?

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,510
>> Natural fit,.

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,830
And then it was just a total experimenting
and

31
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,110
doing and, not knowing what I was doing,
and throwing stuff online and

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,230
getting feedback in over the, over the
months.

33
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,508
I would just keep cranking these songs out
and getting more and more feedback, and

34
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,600
recruiting more people collaborators and
they kind of just got better and

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,710
better and I clarified my goals a little
bit more.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,310
Started trying to make songs that were not
only useful to my Stanford students but

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,240
also to advanced high school students,

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,330
to anybody who is interested in learning
about the material.

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,150
Tried to dial-up the storytelling element
a little bit.

40
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,400
And those videos got enough media
attention and,

41
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,540
and love that I was, I've been able to use
them to do quite a few things that kind of

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,510
led me to the, the Fulbright in New
Zealand to study science communication.

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,260
While I was there I learned a lot about
storytelling and science communication.

44
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,520
And many people have really different
definitions of what, what that means.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,070
And I thought a lot about it.

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,670
Used that to inform how I wanted to
continue to explore music and science.

47
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,930
And have used a lot of those lessons to do
work back here in

48
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,650
the United States with young students in,
in the Bay Area.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,400
>> Great, so, so

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,135
tell us a little bit about some of those,
those projects that you're involved with.

51
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:10,890
What things that you've created with your,
your rap and storytelling?

52
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,830
>> A song that I, that I made while I was
still in Stanford its called Oxidate it or

53
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,320
Love it/ Electon to the Next One.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,690
And, and I was kind of, I'd read this or
heard a piece by Robert Krowech

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,280
on on Radio Lab, kind of saying the citric
acid cycles,

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,890
the most horrible thing in all of high
school biology is, it's, you know?

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,245
I have to memorize the whole thing.

58
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,280
No-body likes learning it.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,800
It crushes the soul out of any biology
student.

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,240
And I heard that and I was like, Robert,
you got it all wrong.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,040
And the citric acid cycle is the most
beautiful, amazing thing ever.

62
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,090
And if you could just convey to students,
kind of the bigger picture,

63
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,840
the context, the story of where the citric
acid cycle fits into this larger picture,

64
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,900
then people can get excited about it.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,840
So try to focus on turning food into ATP
and ATP into doing stuff.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,410
And all told through a parody of a 50 cent
and Jay Z song.

67
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,040
So the music is kind of the hook.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,210
The story's there if you can follow it.

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,640
But there's quite a bit of like, jargon,'
cause it was, it was meant for a,

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,460
a Stanford college class, and, I realized
that,

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,320
and in fact, Robert Colvitch wound up
writing a blog post about it

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,370
that was kind of like, I liked this video,
but I feel giddy, yet mystified.

73
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,590
Like, for a popular audience who didn't
know what,

74
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,860
what a lot of these words meant that song
doesn't communicate almost anything.

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,260
It's kind of fun, but you don't learn
anything about what's really going on.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,710
So when I was in New Zealand, I tried to
adjust the message of the songs to be able

77
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,350
to appeal to younger students, to people
who are just general, the general public.

78
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,850
Made a song called Fossil Rock Anthem.

79
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,510
That was Party Rock Anthem, but about
fossils and paleontology.

80
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,190
And that.
>> That's a great video.

81
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,940
I love that one.
>> Thank you.

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,830
Yeah, I had to learn a lot of animation
skills to help tell the story because I

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,040
think the visuals are a really important
part of it.

84
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,720
And that one has been a hit on the road
cause you get people dancing and

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,380
shoveling and all sorts of stuff.

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,530
But there still isn't much of a story to
that one either.

87
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,250
It's kind of just like, I guess that, it's
a grand story, about we can

88
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,320
understand the world via we can understand
the earth by looking at fossils.

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,680
We can understand life by looking at the
earth and

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,150
those are, those are big grand narratives.

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,660
And then, most recently,

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,820
my projects have been trying to integrate
history into science songs.

93
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,940
So, you know, having students kind of take
on the personas of

94
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,520
scientists where they're discussing
evidence based arguments, ideally,

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,800
about, about science as a process but, so
you're also getting into social context,

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,420
you're getting into ethics, you're getting
into history.

97
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,160
Very interdisciplinary.

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,990
You still get some science, but you get,

99
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,730
what I think is even more important, which
is the nature of science.

100
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,630
>> Yes, so, it seems like all of these
sort of,

101
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,720
all these sort of things going on at once,
gives the student a bunch of

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,120
different lens, angles, ways to approach
the science.

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,550
A lot of different ways for the science to
possibly stick.

104
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,730
So, you're also involved in other
projects.

105
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,480
One of them is a Kickstarter campaign that
was successfully funded in,

106
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,290
in, in progress right now.

107
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,440
Can you tell us a little about that?

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,640
>> Yeah, absolutely, so yeah, when I was
talking about the science history that was

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,630
the, the Kickstarter project.

110
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,630
And I got a little bit of funding early on
from HP and

111
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,220
Silicon Valley Education Foundation who
wanted me to, or

112
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,310
who generously allowed me to make a couple
of videos with kids in the Bay.

113
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,200
And I've met five different students,

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,650
five different teachers at five different
schools in San Jose and Oakland.

115
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,790
I was just like, you know, I've got to do
them all.

116
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,190
I got to do projects at all these places.

117
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,670
I can't, couldn't say no.

118
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,790
So, needed to raise a bunch more money.

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,820
Because another thing I've learned over
the years is that production values

120
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,480
really matter.

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,960
They don't, they don't necessarily matter
as you're learning because

122
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,810
that's an important, you know, learning
curve.

123
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,670
For me, my, my first videos were of
horrible production values.

124
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,120
And they were critical parts of my doing
and learning process.

125
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,070
But at this point, I kind of have more
taste and, and,

126
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,208
and opinions about how things should look.

127
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,210
And when you just give kids a camera and,
and, and let them do whatever they want,

128
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,870
they're so early in that process that
their final product is going to be really,

129
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,710
really powerful for them but not for a
random science teacher in

130
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,580
Australia who's never see, you know,
doesn't know these kids.

131
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,700
There's no emotional attachment.

132
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,640
They just want a product that is good.

133
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,890
So the Kickstarter is a way to raise more
money, increase the budget, get some

134
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,490
professionals and help shoot and edit it
and to really do these stories justice.

135
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,320
And, and the kids would still have this
powerful experience of creating it but

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,650
their products could be used by people
around the world.

137
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,000
>> So, it sounds like, I mean,

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,010
you've done, you had these impressive
projects all around the world.

139
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,865
So, can you tell us a little bit about how
rapping and

140
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:09,940
telling stories about science has helped
you and your students reach their goals?

141
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,370
>> Yeah, absolutely.

142
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,580
I think one, there's many kind of ways
that I think it can be helpful.

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,850
One is, just for

144
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,140
me as a teacher, a way to bottle-up my
excitement about the topic, right.

145
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,640
This guy is making songs about video,

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,260
there must be some interesting stuff,
right.

147
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,920
It's a way to capture that energy.

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,675
Two, so it's a way to connect to students'
lives.

149
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:33,820
I think that's a really important thing in
education,

150
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,870
that if you can make things relevant,
however that works, that's important.

151
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,410
And if it happens to be relevant musically
or culturally or, there's so

152
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,290
many ways to do it, then that's kind of
nice.

153
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,750
I remember when I was teaching at Stanford
I had a song called Going Back to

154
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,270
Plasma Membrane which was to the tune of
Going Back to Cali.

155
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,900
And a student came up to me.

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,360
She's like, Tom, Tom, last weekend at the
frat party, they played that Biggie song.

157
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,283
And we were all singing Going Back to
Plasma Member.

158
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,260
And it was awesome.

159
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,600
So, like, yeah.

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,070
And so ideally, when a student hears a
song on the radio or

161
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,400
is engaging with that material outside of
class,

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,730
they, they end up thinking a little bit
about biology at that moment and

163
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,760
just kind of like sticky, the stickiness
of these songs is a, is a big part of it.

164
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,450
These pop songs like Party Rock Anthem
that people hear millions of times and,

165
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,760
what, it would be nice if they were
thinking about paleontology instead of

166
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,680
just partying.

167
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,810
So that, that is one of the other
benefits.

168
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,610
I think it's, it's kind of what you were
saying when you have a really multifaceted

169
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,110
project, where there's, you have to
understand the material and the history.

170
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,150
And be able to write lyrics, to story
board,

171
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,730
to draw things out, to work as a team.

172
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,360
There's so many different tasks for so
many different learning styles and

173
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,880
types of kids; for introverts, for
extroverts, for everybody.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,800
There's ways for everybody to plug into
the material, and so,

175
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,110
that's a big part of the current projects.

176
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,870
We've got big groups of students all, all
working together on them.

177
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,900
And yeah.

178
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,490
It's just a, it all started really as just
a combination of my interests and

179
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,980
I've come up with all these justifications
afterwards.

180
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,030
But I think it, it has been, pretty cool
for a lot, for a subset of students, not

181
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,535
for everybody but there are a few students
in every class who really enjoy it.

182
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,990
>> And you can definitely see the passion
in the videos.

183
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,750
I mean you're clearly passionate about
what you do and

184
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,220
I think that attracts a lot of people.

185
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,930
It attracted us.

186
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,900
It's very, very cool.

187
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,830
So, tell, tell us a little bit more about,
you've been around this for a while now.

188
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,410
So, what are the,

189
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,340
what are some of the things that you
learned about good ways to tell stories?

190
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,130
What are the ways to tell stories about
science?

191
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,550
>> Mm.
>> And which ones don't work out well,

192
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,400
which ones do work well?

193
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,200
>> This was big, big theme of my masters
experience in New Zealand.

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,820
The mantra of the department was science
communication is about

195
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,630
good story telling and I didn't really
know what it meant when I got there.

196
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,980
I was kind of like, that sounds nice,

197
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,270
like that seems to make sense but I didn't
quite understand what it meant.

198
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,390
I spent two years trying to figure out
what that actually means, right.

199
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,960
Like, how do stories allow you to teach
science or communicate science better?

200
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,170
And I realized that people have really
different ideas.

201
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,200
When one of the main ideas that exist out
there is kind of telling these

202
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,020
archetypal narratives about, you know, the
rags-to-riches or

203
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,780
this, these eight essential human
narratives.

204
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,680
And then just imposing those narrative on
a, onto a footage of penguins.

205
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,480
And there you, you know, March of the
Penguins, box office smash hit,

206
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,450
really when people are watching it,
they're thinking about human beings, and

207
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,340
love and all these and kind of imposing
all these things onto the animals.

208
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,790
And I worry a little bit about sometimes
about that style of, of storytelling,

209
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,270
because it's very entertaining and you
walk away feeling good about penguins,

210
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,970
but you don't necessarily learn a lot
about, you know,

211
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,560
why penguin behavior from a scientific
perspective.

212
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,970
That's probably not their goal, right?

213
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,700
They're just trying to make a cool movie.

214
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,506
But I think there's other ways to get more
at the science.

215
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:16,500
One of those ways is kind of what I would

216
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,160
consider the Carl Sagan style which is to
tell these incredibly beautiful, grand

217
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,270
narritives about human existence that are
almost spiritual in nature because

218
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,500
they allow the audience to really connect
with the material to their own existence.

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,680
Like, wow, I'm made of stars and

220
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,510
we're just tiny little things in a huge
universe.

221
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,380
And, and that's very powerful storytelling
for a lot of people.

222
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,980
And, and it's one of the reasons I'm
personally attracted to science.

223
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,260
That's why I study science, is because I
think the stories that

224
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,210
it tells us about our own lives and our
own existence are the most compelling and

225
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,270
true and interesting stories that exist.

226
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,905
Same goes for evolution and understanding
our connection to all living things and,

227
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:06,860
and our relation to each other, and our
relation to the the living world.

228
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,880
So that's a whole to kind of the grand
narratives.

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,030
There's also a lot of science stories that
are more focused on short stories

230
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,560
that are often funny and relevant to
something in, in your life.

231
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,870
So Stephen J Gould was kind of the king of
this.

232
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,410
He wrote all these short essays that would
connect whatever he was trying to

233
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,670
communicate to baseball or to Mickey Mouse
or to something else.

234
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,230
And you wouldn't know why he was doing it
but

235
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,990
then all of a sudden boom, analogy made,
story completed.

236
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,740
You just learned something awesome.

237
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,600
Mind blown.

238
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,360
Robert Sapolsky here at Stanford also a
total jedi of this,

239
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,410
this kind of technique of storytelling.

240
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,360
And one of the things I've noticed that
both of them do is they

241
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,030
often incorporate the historical
narratives into the storytelling.

242
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,900
So they will kind of oversimplify in a
funny way that allows you to know like,

243
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,630
they're not you know, these characters
he's describing weren't really like this.

244
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,930
But the story's so gripping that you just
want to go on this ride, and

245
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,090
you learn all of these, these things, you
know?

246
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,780
Stephen J Gould versus E.O. Wilson, and
their different philosophies of evolution.

247
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:22,020
Or Barbara McClintock looking for
transposons, and no one believed her.

248
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,430
And it was her against the, she was this
hero fighting against the male

249
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,188
establishment, and, and, those are all
compelling stories that are,

250
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,000
you understand are a little bit over
simplified, but

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,360
allow you to get that transposons, like
I'd, I'll never forget what those are,

252
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,960
because of those stories that he told.

253
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,640
Huge advantage of incorporating history,
is that you get to learn

254
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,550
about what scientist actually do, what
science is about, the ethics of science,

255
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,350
the nature of science, the historical
context and so

256
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,840
many really important things for
understanding what science is.

257
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,639
That's one of the big shifts that I've
made in my own science song,

258
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,500
storytelling world is that I'm, at this
point I'm less interested in

259
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,010
telling you the story of the citric acid
cycle as a, a, a,

260
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,100
you know, an experience that might have a
lot of jargon in it that is kind of just,

261
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,340
the, yeah, the, the communication of
these.

262
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,710
Although it's still very exciting.

263
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,340
It doesn't tell you much about how we
learned that information, or

264
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,220
how scientists study biochemistry, or, or
what science is.

265
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,300
It's like oh, here are the facts.

266
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,010
Here's the story as it already exists.

267
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,980
Whereas when you get into some of the
history you actually are learning about

268
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,130
science as a process.

269
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,610
Which is a mo, ultimately a more important
lesson for students of science.

270
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,790
Last category is,

271
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,880
is kind of stuff that I would learn when I
was doing science in labs.

272
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,730
At lab meetings a lot of PIs will be like,
what's the story you're

273
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,040
trying to tell in this lab meeting and a
lot of times that can be based around your

274
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,630
experimental logic, Even if that's how you
did it or not, you, you're kind of framing

275
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,130
a story of like, then I was doing this,
and then I found this, so then I did this.

276
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,420
It's a quest, or a model,

277
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,430
like scientific models of how things work
are kind of stories.

278
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,700
This molecule, talks to this molecule and
that's the reason blank does blank,.

279
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,080
So yeah those are, I've thought a lot
storytelling in science.

280
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,130
I think there's more that I haven't
mentioned.

281
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,810
I think there's overlap between the things
that I have mentioned.

282
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,850
But I think it's really a valuable
exercise for any student of science or

283
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,793
scientists, anybody who's interested in
it.

284
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,330
To really think about the structure of the
stories they want to tell and

285
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,202
why they're telling them that way.

286
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,600
>> Yeah, so I'm hearing, in particular,
short stories and

287
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,110
historical context you've learned along
the way are really helpful.

288
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,070
>> I wish I had any sort of research to
back that up, there also, it's partially

289
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,480
a personal taste thing right, it's like
for me that is my favorite, right.

290
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,640
I would much rather read a, a Steven J
Gould essay than watch March

291
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,570
of the Penguins, but like, that's not true
for everybody.

292
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,110
So I think there's room for all these
different things.

293
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,080
>> Absolutely, and so hopefully what
we're,

294
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,750
we're trying to do with especially these
interviews is to draw students

295
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,630
closer to the people who are in the field
experencing these environmental stressers.

296
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,880
Or the scientist who are, you know,

297
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,110
at their lab bench discovering the things
that we end up learning about in school.

298
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,290
So, it's pretty exciting to see some
overlap here.

299
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,200
>> Oh, and I think that's, that's, those
are two really,

300
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,220
really important things for students of
science to be thinking about is like what,

301
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,920
how's this relevant in everyday people's
lives, right?

302
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,700
To a mountain climber, to this, to a sky,
like you have to know science in order to,

303
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,590
or you get to know science, and get to
understand these things better.

304
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,090
And then, of course, the scientist who are
studying this.

305
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,720
There's so many rich stories there.

306
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,110
So that's, exactly, exactly,

307
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,730
I would put into that same awesome
category of, like, yeah.

308
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,450
>> It's awesome.

309
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,570
>> You're learning the information, but

310
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,240
you're also learning how you discover that
information.

311
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,950
>> Yeah, that's I think its really
exciting,

312
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,990
its exciting to see where all this stuff
is going to take us.

313
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,639
>> Uh-hm.
>> So

314
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:13,610
that leads me to my next question which is
a kind of difficult question, but if you,

315
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,220
if you could guess into the future so lets
say five, ten, fifteen years from now,

316
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,350
we'll talk about this field of science
communication and story telling.

317
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,370
Where's it going to take us?

318
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,810
>> Yeah.

319
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,340
>> Where do you think we're going with
this stuff?

320
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,160
>> I think one big part of it will be
interactivity.

321
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,830
Just because the way technological tools
are changing.

322
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,420
There's so many opportunities for people
to be a part of any given story.

323
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,940
Whether that's sort of citizen science,
people collecting data and uploading or

324
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,570
people choose your own adventure, you
know,

325
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,010
like you kind of having this control over
what direction you want to go.

326
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,730
So I think that there will probably be
more and

327
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,580
more exciting tools that allow for that.

328
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,270
And allow the, the quote unquote consumer
of the story, or

329
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,290
the student, to really be able to direct
where the story goes.

330
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,050
I also have never really, like until I saw
your guys' videos, I never thought about

331
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:25,220
structuring an entire college course
around this, this train that they

332
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,090
used to call that in school, this, this
narrative train that drives everything.

333
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,150
And there is peripheral stories and side
stories, but this thing that kind of

334
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,940
keeps it all united, and characters that
keep it united.

335
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,610
and, and to me, that seems like a very
smart move, and a very, I,

336
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,450
I would not be surprised to see many MOOCs
copying what you guys do, because I

337
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,185
think it'll be extra entertaining, and
extra fun to follow, and, and

338
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:57,930
will keep people motivated and keep people
interested as, as the course goes on.

339
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,520
>> So, also looking towards the future.

340
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,962
You've done a really cool,

341
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:06,130
really unique exciting things with your
time as a student and beyond.

342
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,640
And there might be other students are
watching like wow,

343
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,320
Tom McFadden is the man, I want to, I want
to tell stories about science maybe it's

344
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,500
through rapping, maybe it's a different
medium like we use.

345
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,140
What advice would you to a student who
came to you,

346
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,530
wanting to follow in your footsteps and
was looking for advice?

347
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,890
>> One of the, the most empowering things
to me was just,

348
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,200
I had these many, many interests when
coming to college.

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,990
I was interest in humanities, in Spanish,
in music and science and

350
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,806
all these different things.

351
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:41,914
And I had many different life experience
and

352
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:47,458
these, this career path of connecting
science, music, working with kids,

353
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:53,230
multimedia, making videos was this crazy
combination of all my interests.

354
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,130
And it wasn't obvious that that should,
should be my, my road.

355
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,280
But once I found it,

356
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,240
it was just boom, like this is exactly all
the things that I like to do.

357
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,440
So one, one piece of advice is I,

358
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,400
I assume that most students have a variety
of interests, right?

359
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,070
Some people are very focused, I just
want to do this.

360
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,160
But I think more and more it is becoming
possible to

361
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,030
create your own connections of your
passions and your own interests, am,

362
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,890
especially if they involve communication
or technology or multimedia.

363
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,280
You can bring in your love of this and
that and the other thing all together and,

364
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,350
and so to not shy away from, from trying
to combine passions.

365
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,030
another, this is kind of a common piece of
advice but

366
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,300
like, those first songs that I made, were
crap, right?

367
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,650
They were not good.

368
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,230
Like the students would kind of like, oh
my ha, ha, ha, my TA is making,

369
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,230
making a rap song and they liked it but it
wasn't like, it was bad, right?

370
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,210
It was, it was poorly recorded.

371
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,410
The video was totally bare bones.

372
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,832
Like, I tried to sing and I can't sing, I
can't carry a tune pretty much.

373
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:08,170
And, and it was bad but like you have to
go through that stage and

374
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:14,280
by continuing to produce quantity you can
get towards quality.

375
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,540
And you, that's the only way to learn is
by doing stuff and

376
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,450
learning from your mistakes and talking to
smart people who are in that field and

377
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:28,330
collaborating and and just the power of
doing something and

378
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,810
instead of just sitting around and
thinking about it, is pretty important.

379
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,790
As we wrap up today, one last question to
leave you with and

380
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,420
it's, what is your, what's the take home
message?

381
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,110
If you have one, you have one token, one
golden nugget,

382
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,980
to leave with us today, what would it be?

383
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,740
>> Let's see, the take home message.

384
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,930
Let me think about that for a minute.

385
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,310
I saw that question earlier and I was
like, man.

386
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,290
>> They're going to hit me with that.

387
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,810
>> I don't, I don't have one take home
message.

388
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,160
I mean, and it's hard to do one without
sounding cliche, you know?

389
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,330
Like, one is, obviously, follow your
passion, like, for you.

390
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,480
because once you,

391
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,340
once you're kind of obsessed with
something everything else becomes easy.

392
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,980
Because you want to be doing it and you're
going to put so much work into it and

393
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,242
you're going to put in so much more
effort.

394
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:21,146
And that is the only way to make quality
work, to do,

395
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:24,550
to produce quality material, is to put in
that much effort.

396
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,520
But it doesn't feel like effort if you're
madly in love with doing it.

397
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,590
That's a lot easier said than done to find
that passion.

398
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,690
So I guess part two would be do a bunch of
stuff [LAUGH].

399
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,940
And, and that's, that can be difficult to
do as well, but I've

400
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,340
benefited tremendously from being able to
explore different fields, different,

401
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,190
media and different experiences and, and
see what really felt right to me.

402
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,195
So if you can do both of those things,
you'll be all right.

403
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,740
[LAUGH]
>> Excellent.

404
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,760
Well, what a great message.

405
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,110
And thanks for being here, Tom.

406
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,460
It was really a pleasure to have you in
and I can't wait to see all of your,

407
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,660
your music take off even more than it
already has.

408
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,314
>> Likewise, I'm very excited to see how,

409
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:13,870
[LAUGH] how this kind of novel form of
online education takes off.

410
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,940
>> We'll see where it goes.

411
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,760
So, I've got one last thing I just thought
of.

412
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,440
Which is I, do you do free style rapping?

413
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,220
>> [LAUGH] I have, I have in the past.

414
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,250
It's not my, my, my best skill.

415
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,140
But, I can practice and you edit it out.

416
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,360
>> I don't either.

417
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,860
I've never really rapped before.

418
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,680
But what I can do, is try to make a little
beat.

419
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,550
And we can just see what comes out of it.

420
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,170
>> Okay.
Okay.

421
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,760
Well, go for it, let's see what happens.

422
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,890
>> It's like I see people put their hands
up to their mouths.

423
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,620
>> That's to protect the audience from the
spit.

424
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,995
>> Okay, got it.

425
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:52,895
So it's like [NOISE]

426
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:59,420
>> Sittin' here at this table of Stanford,
lotta questions and a lotta answers.

427
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,280
Just the interview was Corey and Tom and
maybe you up in the online atmosphere.

428
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,200
Yeah, what happens here is going to go
around the world, and

429
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,585
it's going to keep twirling and I got no
more rhymes.

430
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:17,392
[LAUGH]
>> Error, error, error, error, error, er.

431
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:18,118
Urrgh.
[LAUGH]

432
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:18,810
>> They you go.

433
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,535
>> That was great.

434
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:24,038
[LAUGH] We don't have to use any of it if
you don't want to, but I had a great time.

435
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,720
[LAUGH]
>> Yeah, good.

436
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,202
Sweet, that's fine, I've never freestyle
so that was pretty.

437
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:30,420
[LAUGH] So alright, made a few rounds.

438
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,166
>> Great, [LAUGH] good interview.

439
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:32,920
[LAUGH]
>> Sweet.

440
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,725
>> Even for freestyle.

441
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,600
[LAUGH] So, a good day.
>> Did you want to get in here,

442
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,128
do a little freestyle.

443
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,130
[LAUGH]
>> I don't have that.

444
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,855
>> Oh c'mon!

445
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:44,680
[LAUGH] This is the beauty with a video
is, you can always edit it out.

446
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,559
But if it's fantastic, then -
>> It's true.

447
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,037
>> it's something you'll never forget.

448
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:48,685
Oh, Wes is here, too.

449
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,118
>> I think, I think we have [INAUDIBLE].

450
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:50,880
>> What's up, Wes?

451
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,150
>> Hi, Wesley.
>> I feel like what we just did is,

452
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,260
that's the intro to the video.

453
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,070
>> [LAUGH].
>> We just skip that

454
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,850
whole introduction part.

455
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,331
>> Uh-huh.
