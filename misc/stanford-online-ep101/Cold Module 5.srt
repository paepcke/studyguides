1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,070
I hope you enjoyed watching Corey warm
back up.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,060
A number of people have asked why we
didn't put some clothes on him to

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,350
warm him up.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,500
We probably should have, but

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,810
we were curious about whether the avacore
devices would warm him up sufficiently.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,390
Anyway, I bring it up so you would
understand there's no physiologic reason

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,030
why we didn't put clothes back on him to
warm him up, okay?

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,530
Good.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,760
In this module, we're going to talk about
exercise in the cold,

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,440
which is a topic that we didn't address in
the Corey get's Cold video but

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,860
is an important one nonetheless.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,060
Whether you are climbing in the mountains,
running in the snow, or

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,000
hauling wood back to your cabin in Homer,
Alaska, it is important to

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
know what you can expect from your body
under these conditions?

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,290
So we'll discuss your maximum aerobic
capacity, or VO2 max, your endurance, and

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,300
your muscle activity.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,030
Before we talk about how the cold impacts
VO2 max, I thought I should

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,490
explain what VO2 max actually is, and why
it is an important measure of fitness?

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,630
We'll be referring to it regard,

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,640
regularly throughout this environmental
physiology class.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,500
So it's important to make sure all of you
understand it now.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,860
VO2 is the volume of oxygen that your body
consumes at any particular time.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,440
And VO2 max is the maximum amount of
oxygen your body can consume.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,070
Is also called your maximal aerobic
capacity.

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,330
As you can see in the graph to my right,
VO2 is linearly related to work output.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,220
The more work you do the more oxygen is
required to sustain that activity.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,230
An appropriate training stimulus of high
enough intensity will increase your

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,010
VO2 max.

30
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,160
It's illustrated by the new line in red on
the graph.

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,930
For a given sub maximum work load after
training,

32
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,790
you will still need about the same amount
of oxygen.

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,850
The difference will be, that you will be
able to do more work, and

34
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,760
consume more total oxygen, at maximum
capacity.

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,420
The little plateau at the end of each
line, is the theoretical point,

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,510
where any additional work that you do,

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,530
is supported by non-oxydative sources of
metabolism, like fast glycolosis.

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,330
The picture that just appeared shows one
method of measuring VO2.

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,980
It was taken in the army research lab at
the top of Pikes Peak at 14,000 feet.

40
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,000
The participant is breathing from one way
valve that move air from the room into his

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,370
lungs, back out through the mouthpiece and
down into the analyzer.

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,150
The analyzer measures the oxygen consumed
and the CO2 produced.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,620
V02 max is considered the gold standard
for cardiovascular fitness, because it

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,040
requires successful integration of so many
components of your cardiovascular system.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,930
You have to breathe the air into your
lungs, which is dependent on ventilation.

46
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,420
Then the oxygen in the air has to diffuse
through the lung tissue into

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,890
the arterial blood, where it's picked up
by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,250
The bound oxygen then circulates through
the left side of the heart,

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,200
out through the arteries, and down into
the tissues.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,940
Then your tissues extract the oxygen and
use it in their mytochondria to

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,919
power metabolism and sustain the high
energy outputs of exercise.

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,560
Thus VO2max is dependent on the health of
many elements of your cardiovascular and

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
muscle, muscle system.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,740
For example, if your arteries are plugged
up or you have, or

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,650
are anemic your VO2max will be reduced.

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,600
On the other hand,

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,210
if you're an elite athlete who trains
regularly at high intensity endurance

58
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,510
activities, all those components of the
system will be optimized.

59
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,850
Mathematically and conceptually, V02 can
be defined by the Fick Equation,

60
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,320
which says that V02 is equal to Q,

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,120
which is cardiac output, times a minus v
02 difference.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,130
Cardiac output is the amount of blood that
leaves the heart per minute, and is equal

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,670
to the heart rate, beats per minute, times
stroke volume, blood ejected per beat.

64
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,760
The arteriovenous O2 difference is the
amount of oxygen in the arterio blood or

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,750
little a minus the amount of oxygen in the
venous blood or v.

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,950
In other words the amount of blood
extracted by the tissues.

67
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,050
Together the components of the equation
tell you how much oxygen your

68
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,329
body is using per minute.

69
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,080
Okay then.

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,050
That was a long preamble to, what happens
to VO2 max in the cold?

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,950
Well, after all that, the answer is, it's
hard to say.

72
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,419
It depends on how cold it is outside, and
how cold you are inside.

73
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,532
Because of the heat that you generate
during exercise,

74
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:34,708
core temperature can go up, even if it is
very cold out.

75
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:39,526
If your core stays relatively stable,
VO2max can actually go up in the cold,

76
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:43,176
because the cooler temperatures cause
peripheral skin and

77
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:48,680
tissue vessels, to remain constricted,
which would increase central blood volume.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,889
Higher central blood volume means more
blood would return to the heart,

79
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,127
increasing stroke volume, and thus cardiac
output.

80
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:01,624
The Fick equation says that higher cardiac
output means higher VO2max.

81
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,549
On the other hand, if core and

82
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:08,536
muscle temperatures are lower, then
maximum capacity would be impaired.

83
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,450
Nerve signaling would be slowed,

84
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,608
muscle function would be compromised,
blood would get more viscous, and

85
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:18,292
even max heart rate would decline as core
temperature went down.

86
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,482
So as you can see, it is critical for peak
performance to keep body and

87
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,489
muscle temperature in an optimal range.

88
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,350
An aerobic exercise that is performed for
a long period of

89
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,780
time at a sub-maximal workload is
considered an endurance activity.

90
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,170
Endurance exercise is compromised by fall
in core and or muscle temperature.

91
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,695
First, there is the higher metabolic cost
for a given workload, because more,

92
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:47,100
less-efficient fibers may be needed to do
the work.

93
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,620
Also contraction of agonist, antagonist
muscle pairs during shivering,

94
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,310
waste energy.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,930
Second the constriction of peripheral
vessel means less blood flows to

96
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,510
subcutaneous adipose or

97
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,020
fat tissue, so less of that abundant long
term fuel sources available.

98
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,560
Therefore, there is an increased
dependence on carbohydrate fuels that

99
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,500
are limited in supply and can cause an
increase in lactate concentrations.

100
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:17,400
In the orange box below, it says that
bonking, or hitting the wall,

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,200
is what happens when you run out of
carbohydrate, especially glycogen.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,960
Even if there is still fat around when
that happens,

103
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,630
fats burn in the fire of carbohydrate.

104
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,890
It's a complicated biochemical process but
essentially what it

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,830
means is you need some amount of
carbohydrate around to use your fat.

106
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,989
So you can't keep exercising if you've run
out of carbohydrate.

107
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,760
Cold muscle and

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,180
core temperatures may also change the
hemoglobin binding characteristics,

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,640
making it harder for your red blood cells
to release oxygen in the tissues.

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,350
Now, muscle activity.

111
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,920
Interestingly, muscle fatigue has been
shown to actually improve by some but

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,720
not all studies when the muscles are kept
slightly cool.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,650
The mechanism of improvement is unknown,
although some scientists hypothesize that

114
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,770
it relates to signal processing and
central control by the brain.

115
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,450
Maybe the brain is thinking, hey, the
muscle isn't hot, it must not be tired.

116
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,140
As opposed to cool muscles, cold muscles
fatigue faster because of the slowed nerve

117
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,369
conduction velocity, altered recruitment
patterns, and the Q10 effect.

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,620
Peak power and strength also declines for
those same reasons.

119
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,671
Manual dexterity goes down for the reasons
we talked about in the previous module.

120
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,081
Just as a FYI, I put the tension versus
recruitment graph back up, for

121
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,060
you as a reminder.

122
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,140
So when it comes to exercise is not only
about the ambient temperature, but

123
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,130
how cold you are inside.

124
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,220
The bottomline if you're cold in the cold
is that, slightly cold can be good for

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,840
both muscle fatigue and VO2 max.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,300
But very cold is bad for fatigue, VO2 max,
endurance and muscle strength and power.

127
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,140
If you're going to exercise, in serious
cold,

128
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,650
here are some things to keep in mind.

129
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,400
Make sure to dress appropriately, in
comfortable layers, that won't accumulate

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,700
sweat, and that can be removed or added as
needed to modulate temperature.

131
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,720
Avoid cotton, and wear a wicking layer
like polypropylene, close to your skin.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,500
Avoid the temptation to over dress, but be
sure to at least carry a hat.

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,870
Because your head is one of the main
sources of heat loss.

134
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,940
Even if there is no weather generated
wind, remember that you may be moving at

135
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,140
a rapid pace through cold air, which
generates its own wind chill.

136
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,960
Also, head into the wind on the way out
and have the wind at

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,220
your back on the way in to avoid the wind
chill against sweat saturated clothing.

138
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,560
Proper warm-up.

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,540
Optimal performance requires the elevation
of muscle temperature before competition,

140
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,830
especially in events requiring strength
and power.

141
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,580
Heavier clothing, exercising more
intensely, and

142
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,620
or longer, and continuing the warm-up
until immediately before the competition,

143
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,350
may be required in cold conditions.

144
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,240
In severe cold, avoid exposing delicate
skin areas like ears, nose and fingers.

145
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,875
They are susceptible to frost bite.

146
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:16,430
Since the tissue would go numb first, and
there will be no sensation of pain,

147
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,110
check regularly, to sure that the tissues
are not turning white.

148
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,580
Once you stop exercising, core temperature
can fall rapidly,

149
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,550
because heat production slows, but heat
loss remains high.

150
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,440
Put on clothing layers rapidly and

151
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,700
to, and move to a warmer environment soon
to prevent post-exercise hypothermia.

152
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,110
Congratulations.

153
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,185
You've completed another one!

154
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:42,440
[LAUGH] Now complete the check for
understanding questions and

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,900
move on to module six to find out how our
bodies adapt to cold.

156
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,250
Something's gotta be going on.

157
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,970
Because my students from cold climates all
show up in class in

158
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,410
shorts in the middle of winter.

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,110
While the rest of us Californians are
freezing.

160
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,990
I guess we'll find out in the next module.

161
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,390
See you then, thank you.
