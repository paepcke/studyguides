00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,890
Welcome back to the Physiology of Stress.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,440
We've learned a lot about how stress is
more than simply a, a fleeting feeling.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,030
It grips our physiology in measurable ways
and

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,160
can have a big negative impact on our
health if not managed appropriately.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,600
The fact of the matter is, stress is a
major problem in our world.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,086
It's estimated that 60% to 90% of visits
to primary-care doctors are for

7
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:33,947
stress-related problems, 90%.

8
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:39,179
It's no exaggeration to say that stress is
an epidemic in our society.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,970
So, it's also not too hard to imagine that
you too could

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,990
gain huge benefits by developing a better
relationship with stress.

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,790
So what do we do?

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,280
Fortunately, there is something we can do
to combat the negative effects of stress.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,340
And we don't have to go very far, to find
it.

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,470
Mother nature, in her infinite wisdom, has
pre-programmed each and

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,890
every one of us with the capacity to
combat stress.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,580
We call this gift the parasympathetic
nervous system.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,100
So here's a quick glimpse at where we are
headed in the next three videos.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,050
We will start now with an overview of the
parasympathetic nervous system.

19
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,350
The next video, after this one,

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,100
will talk about the physiology of the
parasympathetic system and

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,220
what vagal tone is and strategies that
exist to increase it.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,410
And lastly, in our last video of the
section,

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,950
we're going to present a number of
practical tools developed by scientists to

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,380
help you optimize your now new and
improved relationship with stress.

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,990
Thus far, we've focused primarily on the
sympathetic branch of

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,630
the autonomic nervous system, responsible
for

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,940
mobilizing resources necessary for dealing
with stress.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,210
Now we're going to move to the
parasympathetic nervous system.

29
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,430
Often referred to as the rest and digest,
or the tend and befriend system.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,000
In contrast to sympathetic activation,
parasympathetic activation focuses

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,940
resources inward in a, in an anabolic, or
a rebuilding effort.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
So what we're going to do now is a little
learning, by doing.

33
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,030
You'll have to extend a little bit of
trust as I help lead you

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,970
through an exercise in activating the
system that we're learning about.

35
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,570
I'm going to lead you through our first
stress-management tool,

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,550
borrowed from the HeartMath Institute.

37
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,660
This tool capitalizes on the knowledge of
the physiology of

38
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,790
the body to alter the internal
environment.

39
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,210
For this reason, versions of this tool are
used widely by successful mental-health

40
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,210
providers, psychologists, and coaches from
all over the world.

41
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,770
So now's a good time to find a
comfortable,

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,940
relaxed position in your chair.

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,710
And prepare yourself for about a five
minute activity.

44
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,190
Pause the video now for a few minutes to
get yourself ready.

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,680
Close the door to your room and office and
remove any distractors that you might have

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,475
around you and then feel free to click
play whenever you're ready.

47
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:29,247
We're going to start by redirecting our
attention,

48
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:34,410
from our heads to our hearts.

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,869
And taking a few deep, breaths.

50
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,590
If you're anything like me or most people
for

51
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,700
that matter, you end up spending a lot
more time up here then down here.

52
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,530
Focusing on our breath helps engage our
vagus nerve and our physiology,

53
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,380
which is why breathing techniques are so
commonly used in relaxation exercises.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,630
I like to help direct my focus towards my
chest by placing my hand on top of

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,490
my heart and making little circle motions
or just holding it right there.

56
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,750
Do whatever feels most natural to you as
you let your everyday thoughts slip away,

57
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,850
and turn inward to your heart, and to your
breath.

58
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,720
Close your eyes if you feel comfortable.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,140
As you continue to breathe, as if you were
breathing in and out of your heart.

60
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:45,780
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,810
To shift our physiology to the next level,

62
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,770
we're going to have to make an emotional
shift.

63
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,030
Keep your eyes closed, and continue your
deep breaths as I speak to you.

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,620
Our hearts are incredible machines.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,170
Whether we care to notice the heart or

66
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,170
not, it continues to beat and give us the
gift of life.

67
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,480
For many of us, it will beat more than a
billion times in our lifetime.

68
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,280
Wow.
A billion.

69
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,630
That's incredible.

70
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,900
Lucky for us, we have a lot more to feel
grateful for

71
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,750
in our lives than just our hearts.

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,810
I want you to remember a time that you
felt a really positive feeling

73
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,590
of appreciation.

74
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,690
A time when you felt grateful.

75
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,410
Whatever the first memory is that comes to
mind, big or small, it doesn't matter.

76
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,860
I just want you to relive that experience
in your mind.

77
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,809
Who were you with, what were you doing?

78
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,660
What sorts of things did you hear?

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,440
And how did you feel?

80
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,000
As you focus on that feeling of
appreciation and

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,569
gratitude, I want you to make that image
clear.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,980
The sounds louder and that feeling
stronger.

83
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:30,410
[BLANK_AUDIO]

84
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,519
Stay in your heart, breathing deeply, as
you continue to feel that great feeling.

85
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,590
Life is a pretty mysterious and

86
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,830
beautiful thing, and we have so much to be
grateful for.

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,060
Enjoy that state, and enjoy that feeling,
and I'll be waiting for

88
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,880
you in the next video when you're done.
