00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,362
[MUSIC]
>> So Dr.

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:08,051
Benson, would you show me how to elicit
the relaxation response?

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,300
>> Be delighted to do so.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,110
First of all, if you're doing this for
medical reasons,

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,630
check with your health care professional
first so that she or he knows that you're

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,070
doing this because you might have to alter
medications, or what have you.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,850
You can have either a secular repetition
or a religious one.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,760
Secular terms could be the number one.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,330
The word peace.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,430
The word calm.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,350
The word gentle.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,870
Religious, if you're Roman Catholic, hail
Mary, full of grace.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:54,060
And if you're Spanish, Portuguese, or
Italian, that becomes Ave Maria.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,535
So, which would you prefer, a secular or
religious term?

15
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,020
>> I'll choose a secular route.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,250
>> And which word, or sound?

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,860
>> I'll say calm.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,320
>> Calm.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,370
Okay, now sit up and close your eyes, and

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,636
relax all your muscles starting with your
feet.

21
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:17,328
Your calves.

22
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,020
Your thighs.

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,390
Shrug your shoulders around.

24
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,950
Shrug your shoulders and roll your head
and neck around, great.

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,509
Okay, now sit at ease without movement and
breath slowly.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,160
And each, and breathe slowly, and each
time your breath is coming out,

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,322
say silently to yourself, we're calm.

28
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:52,015
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:57,150
And you're going to find all sorts of
other thoughts coming into your head.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,809
They are normal.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,860
They are natural and should be expected.

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,560
But when they occur, don't be upset, but

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,620
simply say, oh well, and come back to
calm.

34
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:21,200
Now I'm going to let you do this for three
or four minutes, at the end of which time

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,250
I'll ask you to keep your eyes closed but
to start thinking your regular thoughts.

36
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,100
But now, on your out breath, calm.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,860
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,745
Other thoughts, oh well.

39
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:44,831
And back

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:50,044
to calm.

41

[MUSIC]

42
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,242
Now keep your eyes closed.

43
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:58,036
Keep them closed.

44
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,070
Let's start thinking your regular
thoughts.

45
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:08,250
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:16,994
And now slowly, slowly open your eyes.

47
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,590
[MUSIC]

48
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,850
>> Was that at all

49
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,910
difficult for you?

50
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,660
>> It was, at times, difficult to come
back to the word.

51
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,950
But it was not a, not difficult in another
sense.

52
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,700
Did you notice any changes in yourself
doing so.

53
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,440
>> Definitely.

54
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,460
I feel mellow right now, and, I notice
when you gave me

55
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,696
the instructions to stop focusing on the
word and to think my own normal thoughts,

56
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:04,085
it was almost like I had to reach out and
pull them back towards me again.

57
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,060
>> Did you notice any change in your
breathing?

58
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,180
>> Definitely.

59
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,810
I slowed down.

60
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,410
>> Slowed down.

61
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,550
And, you're on camera now.

62
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,915
You even look younger than you looked
before because your facial musculature,

63
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:20,803
and that.

64
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:21,720
>> Is relaxed.

65
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,977
>> And, it, most people now have a sense
of well-being that you didn't

66
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:36,780
have when you were doing the interview
where we were talking before.

67
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,350
Is that part of what you're experiencing
now?

68
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,120
>> It's truly incredible.

69
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,670
>> Things are okay.

70
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,151
>> Things are okay.
