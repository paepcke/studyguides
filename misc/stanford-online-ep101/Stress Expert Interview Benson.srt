00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:38,446
Welcome to our expert interview in
relaxation response physiology with Dr.

3
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:39,788
Herbert Benson.

4
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:44,276
Dr. Benson is the director emeritus with
the Benson-Henry Institute here at

5
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:46,724
the Massachusetts General Hospital, and

6
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,720
a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School.

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,200
A graduate of Harvard Medical School, Dr.
Benson is the author or

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,335
coauthor of more than 190 scientific
publications and 12 books.

9
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:04,650
Dr. Benson is a pioneer in mind-body
medicine and a leading researcher in,

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,935
in the study of relaxation response
physiology, and

11
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,260
its efficacy in counteracting the harmful
effects of stress.

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,570
A highly decorated clinician and
researcher, Dr.

13
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,630
Benson has received numerous national and
international awards for his work.

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,840
A best-selling author and frequently
interviewed physician,

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,199
his work has positively impacted the lives
of millions of people.

16
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,560
So for those reasons and for many others,
it's a great honor to now turn to our

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,296
expert interview in relaxation response
physiology with Dr. Herbert Benson.

18
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,710
Dr. Benson, it's really an honor to be
here with you today.

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,820
Thank you so much for your time.

20
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,860
>> Thank you.

21
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,970
Thank you for coming.

22
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,900
>> It's a pleasure to meet you.

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,850
So I thought that a great place to start
this morning would be right at

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,750
the beginning, and I was wondering if you
could share a little bit about your

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,310
story of how you became involved with the
study of relaxation response physiology?

26
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,570
>> Thank you.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,412
It's a true honor to be part of this
Stanford series and

28
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:09,512
to be able to explain how we possess an
alternative response

29
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:15,246
within us that's opposite to the stress
response, and

30
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:21,346
to the extent that any disorder or any
condition is caused or

31
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:27,080
made worse by stress, to that extent we
have a natural,

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,526
inborn capacity to counteract that.

33
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:38,978
I'm a cardiologist by training, and early
in my career I was noting that people,

34
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:46,665
patients, coming to me to see me, had
disproportionately high blood pressures.

35
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:52,431
And I'd medicate them and I'd be
consistently over-medicating them,

36
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:58,848
and I wondered maybe there was something
different about the measurement that was

37
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:05,200
going on in their blood pressure, compared
to their every day blood pressure.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,492
In those days so-called white coat
hypertension had not been defined.

39
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:17,068
Namely, the white coat of the health care
professional would be threatening and

40
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,769
a stress, and therefore raise the blood
pressure.

41
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,979
And that got us wondering, perhaps high
blood pressure was more

42
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:33,276
than kidney disease, which is was felt to
be due to at that time.

43
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:38,424
And this was heretical because, that the
mind would

44
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:44,788
effect the body 40 years or so ago was in
a different universe.

45
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,010
But it was a finding.

46
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:55,855
And then young people hearing about these
studies came to me.

47
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:58,701
Younger people, I was young in those days.

48
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,468
Younger people came to me and said, why
are you fooling around with monkeys?

49
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,181
Why don't you study us?

50
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,958
We practice transcendental meditation.

51
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:15,798
And if stress and high blood pressure was
beyond the pale of routine science,

52
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:22,590
meditation was in another universe, and I
refused.

53
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,800
I was already being told by studying
stress was unacceptable.

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,550
It wasn't science.

55
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,380
But these people wouldn't go away.

56
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,410
They kept coming back insisting that they
had lower blood pressure.

57
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,830
So I decided, why not give a look?

58
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,250
And these were days before human studies
committees,

59
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,000
before institutional review boards, where
we didn't have to clear it.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,830
And I decided to do so, but we were still
careful.

61
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,770
We studied them only in an evening,

62
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,670
bringing them in through a side door when
people wouldn't see them,

63
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:09,040
and instrumented them with all sorts of
measuring parameters.

64
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,266
The first 20 minutes, regular thinking.

65
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:15,232
Next 20 minutes, meditation.

66
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,820
Third 20 minutes, regular thinking.

67
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,170
Off, on, off.

68
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,220
There were dramatic changes by that simple
act of changing their thinking.

69
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,995
And the hallmark of that, and

70
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:36,470
to this day, is a decrease in the
metabolic rate of the body.

71
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,830
It was an overall quieting response.

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,310
And in one of those wonderful,
serendipitous happenstances,

73
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,070
the room at Harvard Medical School in
which we were

74
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,310
doing these studies were the very studies
40 years before

75
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,240
Walter B Cannon had defined the
fight-or-flight response.

76
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,870
And it made no sense if this was an
opposite response,

77
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,132
that transcendental meditation would be
the only way to do it.

78
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:20,470
It would be as if to say there was just
one way to stress yourself.

79
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,550
It didn't make sense.

80
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,610
So we looked at, into the components that
made up transcendental meditation, and

81
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,410
we felt that there were two, and the first
was a repetition.

82
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:41,060
That could be a word, a sound, a prayer, a
phrase, or a repetitive movement.

83
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,410
The second is when other thoughts came to
mind you disregarded them and

84
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,130
returned to the repetition.

85
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,379
What these two steps do is break the train
of everyday thinking.

86
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,630
So we then went back to, and spent two
years reviewing the religious and

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,880
secular literatures of the world to see
whether or

88
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,960
not these two steps hadn't been described
before.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,690
And lo and behold, it was ubiquitous.

90
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,130
Well, if this were the case, we felt we
could replicate this.

91
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,770
So we went back to the laboratory.

92
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,170
We found changes indistinguishable from
those of transcendental meditation.

93
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,830
Decreased metabolism, heart rate, blood
pressure, brain waves.

94
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,480
At any rate, this now was science.

95
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,670
Here was something that was predictable,
reproducible, and measurable.

96
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,400
And we started then with interventions
that would regularly evoke the relaxation

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,700
response and studied what we felt were
stress-related diseases.

98
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,861
And what we found over the decades was
that to the extent that any disorder

99
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:05,224
is caused or exacerbated by stress, by the
fight-or-flight response,

100
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:10,219
to that extent the relaxation response
would be useful.

101
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:16,738
And new technologies as the years spun out
became available for

102
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:22,273
us to then study what is going on here,
and about ten or

103
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:28,300
so years ago we started our measurements
of genes changing

104
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,719
their activity when people evoke the
relaxation response.

105
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,944
And when we compared the two groups, those
who were

106
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:43,269
regularly evoking the relaxation response,
albeit by different techniques, and

107
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,857
those not doing so, there were changes in
their genetic expression.

108
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:50,170
Then we took the controls.

109
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,310
It's part of the same initial experiment,

110
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,560
who had never evoked the relaxation
response, and taught them to do so.

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,260
And then they did so for eight weeks on a
regular, once a day bras basis.

112
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,324
This was now a prospective experiment
where the individual is off-on,

113
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:18,370
[COUGH] and what we found in those initial
and

114
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,280
subsequent analyses was that when people
evoke the relaxation response,

115
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,950
either for the first time you know, over a
short period, or

116
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,470
for long periods, the same gene's activity
were changing.

117
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,530
This was measuring all genes,

118
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,850
we had no hypothesis going in, so it's
really shotgun.

119
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,970
And what we found were there were four
categories that

120
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,346
are changed when people evoke the
relaxation response.

121
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:59,540
One is oxidative phosphorylation.

122
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,680
That is, the mitochondrial RNA activity
is, is quieted.

123
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,020
And incidentally, this is different from
what happens in stress,

124
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:19,090
because the same mitochondrial RNA
activity chains are activated.

125
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,600
What we were finding in the relaxation
response, they were deactivated.

126
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,463
Secondarily, another cluster of genes were
related to insulin.

127
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:37,123
Insulin metabolism and they were, that was
increased in people evoking the relaxation

128
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:43,530
response, namely putting for, forth more
insulin, more insulin being created.

129
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,678
And importantly, another hub site was the
site

130
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:54,700
controlling the inflammatory system, the
immune system.

131
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:03,212
And the core there was a, a molecule
called NF-kappaB, which was deactivated.

132
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:07,112
And NF-kappaB is the molecule that

133
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:12,768
controls an inordinate amount of disease
states.

134
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:18,837
Such as hypertension, such as various
autoimmune

135
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:24,319
diseases such as atherosclerosis and heart
attacks.

136
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:29,764
NF-kappaB being activated in the stress
related disorders were

137
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:33,388
deactivated by the relaxation response.

138
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:38,107
And the fourth set of genes were genes
that were

139
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:43,836
activated under stress that control
telomere length.

140
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:49,959
Telomeres, the more stressed you are, the
shorter your telomere becomes.

141
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,251
And what we've found is that telomere
stabilization came about

142
00:11:55,251 --> 00:12:00,249
with the relaxation response and the very
aging of cells, so

143
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,630
called apoptosis was being decreased.

144
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,410
>> So where do you think this field is
headed?

145
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,180
What, what kind of capability do you
envision, using this knowledge of

146
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,460
relaxation response physiology 10, 20, 30
years from now?

147
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:22,106
>> I believe that our world probably will
become ever more stressful.

148
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:27,094
Because, we're having to adjust
behaviorally to

149
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:32,084
changes occurring at an ever more frequent
space.

150
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:39,266
And I think we need the relaxation
response to be evoked regularly so

151
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:48,202
we can take advantage of this natural
capacity within us, costing only time.

152
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,773
>> Mm-hm.

153
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:50,530
>> So, what do we do?

154
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,290
We're going to have to introduce this into
our educational systems.

155
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,460
We have to teach this in our schools, and
they can be taught in a secular fashion.

156
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,179
And I think what's been built up over the
years

157
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:15,460
to carry us to this current point is the
scientific credibility of this.

158
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,810
And we've gotta be careful not to teach
any one technique as

159
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,610
being more important than others.

160
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,970
That is a danger.

161
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,990
Because once a person evokes the
relaxation response there's this

162
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,420
feeling that theirs is the best way, the
only way.

163
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,580
We see this with techniques becoming more
or

164
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,000
less popular or religions becoming more or
less popular.

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,920
It has to be left up to the individual and
a generic way

166
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,430
of evoking the relaxation response can be
easily taught.

167
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:59,420
It should be furthermore taught for
performance.

168
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,300
When you evoke the relaxation response
your mind is quieter.

169
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,980
There's less static, less noise, and you
can use visualizations as a way to

170
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,600
if you will, practice an athletic
endeavor.

171
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,130
Hitting a tennis ball.

172
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,750
Hitting a golf ball.

173
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,490
Shooting a basket.

174
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,840
The super athletes go into neutral, and

175
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,190
they evoke a visualization naturally
within themselves.

176
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,720
So it should be part of that training.

177
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,890
This should be part of military training,
for

178
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,360
people who where PTSD can be treated.

179
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,090
In fact, it should be a routine aspect of
treatment and

180
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:55,250
prevention of stress-related disorders,
and with stress being so prevalent

181
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:04,020
we should be using less drugs and less
surgeries and using this capacity.

182
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,940
And I'm not saying they'll replace drugs,
they won't.

183
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,210
There are no substitutes for the awesome
power of many drugs, but

184
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,260
they should be used together with the
stress-related aspect so

185
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,380
you don't use as much medication.

186
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,370
So it should be, I believe,

187
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,730
the relaxation response, a routine part of
our daily life.

188
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:35,800
And all we'll be doing is repeating what
people have done for millennia.

189
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,550
And we have actually turned away from
relaxation response

190
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,100
practices because we don't have time for
it, which actually compounds things.

191
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,140
>> The ultimate irony.

192
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,600
>> Because, it makes the stress worse.

193
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,580
So it should be, I believe,

194
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,760
the relaxation response, a routine part of
our daily life.

195
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,700
>> There are many members of our audience
who are students, and some of whom might

196
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,880
be interested in following in your
footsteps and embark on their own journeys

197
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,893
in this field of relaxation response,
physiology and mind-body medicine.

198
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:12,895
So, what advice would you give to those
students who are listening?

199
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:16,695
>> Well, congratulations on being so
young.

200
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:20,779
>> [LAUGH]
>> It, it's wonderful that you have.

201
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,070
>> Our telomeres are long.

202
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:29,257
>> [LAUGH] But it's wonderful that you
have a, a future in front of you.

203
00:16:29,257 --> 00:16:31,140
Use it appropriately.

204
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,520
In other words, use it to be healthy, and
to have a sense of well being, and

205
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,920
to recognize both natural and unnatural
influences in your life.

206
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,120
And this is simply part of your education.

207
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,268
And I wish I were your age.

208
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:53,834
[LAUGH]

209
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:57,810
>> [LAUGH] So, we're approaching the end
of our interview now.

210
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,950
And so, the last question I'd like to ask
you, you've given us a lot of practical

211
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,729
information today, but if you could zone
in on one practical element of knowledge,

212
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,200
what is it that you would like to
emphasize to our audience?

213
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,590
What's the take-home message?

214
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:22,260
>> We as humans have capacities within us
that are often unrecognized.

215
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,540
Be open to learning about what you can do
for yourself so

216
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,410
that you could help yourself and in the
process help others as well, and

217
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:42,120
I believe that stress is often very
important for performance.

218
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
And you don't want to turn away.

219
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,340
You don't want to become a what, me worry
type of person.

220
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,050
But you can learn to counteract stress
appropriately.

221
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,490
And I hope you choose to use it to help
yourself.

222
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,240
>> Well, that wraps it up for today.

223
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,759
Thank you so much, Dr. Benson, for your
time.

224
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,527
I think, I can say on behalf of all of us,

225
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,096
this is truly an honor to be a part of
your, your day today.

226
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:06,220
>> Thank you.

227
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,152
>> Thank you.

228
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,239
So thank you for sharing.
>> Thank you for coming.

229
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:18,239
