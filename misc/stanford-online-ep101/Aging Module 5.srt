1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,550
Did you move?

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,610
I hope so, I did.

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,550
I went out and got a bit of fresh air, and
now my head is back in the game, and

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,340
I'm ready to push forward.

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,250
Speaking of pushing forward, when you're
muscles move you forward,

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,970
they need to pull on something.

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,740
That would be your bones and joints.

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,470
Nice transition, eh?

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,520
The density of your bones is a major
contributor to their strength, and

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,120
it's pretty easy to measure bone density
non-invasively these days.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,270
Thus, it is frequently used as an
indicator for your risk of fracture.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,590
To my right is a normal pattern of bone
gained and lost throughout life.

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,920
Peak bone mass is usually reached in the
late 20's.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,860
It is higher for men than women because of
larger body sizes mean more muscle and

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,620
weight pulling on the bones and

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,680
higher testosterone which enhances bone
size and density.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,700
In the graph you can see that both men and
women lose bone throughout adulthood.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,010
But women experience an accelerated loss
around menopause,

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,140
when the protective effect of estrogen is
lost.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,760
The accelerated period of loss can last
ten years for some women.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,639
This pattern puts women more at risk of
osteoporosis in their later years.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,540
The word osteoporosis literally means
porous bones.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,870
It occurs when bone loses an excessive
amount of their protein, mineral content,

25
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,070
particularly calcium resulting in a
decrease in bone strength.

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,590
As a result bones become fragile and break
easily with a fall or

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,379
sometimes as little as a sneeze or
vigorous handshake.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,700
Osteoporosis is five times more prevalent
in women than in men, and Asian and

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,600
Caucasian women of small stature are most
at risk.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,970
During menopause, bone loss is more
associated with

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,730
the trabecular bone pictured here, than
the harder cortical bone.

32
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,520
Trabecular bone fills the vertebral bodies
of the spine, your hips and

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,100
wrists, which are all major osteoperotic
fracture sites, and

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,680
you can see from its appearance why it's
called spongy bone.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,700
The panel on the left is normal trabecular
bone, and

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,970
the panel on the right is osteoporotic
bone.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,650
A lot of surface area of trabecular bone
to mine for minerals, and

38
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,330
you can see what happens when that mining
gets out of balance.

39
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,150
The trabecula on the right are thinner,
and in some cases, gone altogether.

40
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,750
If you were going to build something
strong you

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,790
would definitely pick the substance on the
left.

42
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,030
The loss of those supporting structures
over time causes compression fractures in

43
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,840
the spine that you can see in the next
picture.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,660
See how all those vertebr- vertebrae in
the center of the picture are crushed and

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,890
jagged and the whole spine is bent over?

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,190
That compression is what leads to the
hunched look that some older adults have

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,860
when they get osteoporosis, like the woman
pictured here.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,090
What causes the loss of bone throughout
our lives?

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,760
Just like everything else in our bodies
its a balance between synthesis and

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,200
breakdown we have a series of bone
remodeling units that

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,450
are made up of osteoclasts and
osteoblasts.

52
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,130
In response to nutrient needs, or

53
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,780
to fix a micro-fracture, the osteoclasts
will become active and

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,130
resorb the bone, thus releasing minerals
that be used by your body in other places.

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,950
Then the osteoblasts come in to build a
new bone,

56
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,520
to fill in the little hole that was made.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,820
Unfortunately, that process is never 100%
efficient, so

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,780
you lose a little bit of bone at each of
the sites.

59
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,600
Over time, the losses add up.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,990
Estrogen suppresses osteoclast activity.

61
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,040
So during menopause, when estrogen falls,
bone resorption rates increase,

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,910
throwing the system out of balance and
accelerating bone loss.

63
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,720
As I mentioned, your bone remodeling units
respond to micro-damage,

64
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,910
nutrient needs and the changes in loading
pattern.

65
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,990
In the table to my right are a series of
intrinsic and

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,570
extrinsic factors that also can impact the
balance of the modeling units.

67
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,890
The intrinsic ones you can't do much
about.

68
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,520
But the extrinsic, extrinsic ones you can
control.

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,149
Notice our friend, physical activity is
again on the list?

70
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,090
As the muscles pull on the bone,

71
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,580
the bone cells called osteocytes send
signals to the remodeling units.

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,810
In this way, bone will adapt to
accommodate the stress that is

73
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,060
placed upon it by up regulating osteoblast
activity.

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,200
Human studies show that regular exercise
training programs can reduce bone loss by

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,250
one percent per year in the spine and hip
in pre and post menopausal women.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,330
Two important ways to optimize your bone
density is to maximize peak bone mass and

77
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,550
minimize age and menopausal related loss.

78
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,170
Regular weight bearing exercise and good
nutrition including calcium and

79
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,400
Vitamin D through childhood are critical
to optimizing your peak bone mass.

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,671
Also, aminerial which is a delay or
interruption of normalmenices can sup

81
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,119
press the development of peak bone mass by
increasing absorption.

82
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,420
Many young, elite athletes that are
dependent on high training loads and or

83
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,590
caloric restriction for

84
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,390
success are at risk for disrupting normal
estrogen cycles.

85
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,830
With reduced estrogen levels, bone can be
negatively impacted at

86
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,930
that critical growth phase, which many not
be repairable later on.

87
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,890
If you or your children are amenorrheic,

88
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,230
you should seek medical assistance to
address this situation.

89
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,620
There are a variety of recommendation to
my right,

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,050
on the slide, to minimize age associated
loss.

91
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,205
There are also more detailed
recommendations and

92
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:27,370
explanations on the Mayo Clinic and
National Institute of Aging website.

93
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,802
Especially if you are female and have a
history of osteoporosis in the family,

94
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:33,170
it is worth taking a look at these
recommendations.

95
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,790
Moving on to joints.

96
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,430
With age, joints become stiffer and less
flexible.

97
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,250
The fluid that keeps everything springy
and lubricated starts to decrease.

98
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,200
Their joints start to rub together in a
road.

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,430
Degenerative changes like the loss of
joint cartilage begin to

100
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,010
occur especially in the hip and knees.

101
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,590
Overall, the result is stiffer and more
painful movements of the joints.

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,740
Why do we become less flexible?

103
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,790
As our bodies slowly dehydrate, the
tissues become less elastic.

104
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,205
Also, increases in calcium deposits,
adhesions and

105
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:12,480
cross-links cause structural changes to
the cartilage.

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,980
Finally, some of our normally stretchy
muscle fibers begin to

107
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,616
be replaced with scar tissues like
collagen fibers.

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,350
We also may stretch less, either
intentionally, or

109
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,700
by changing our normal activities that
require stretching.

110
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,280
You may remember in the story video, Bill
told his friend every night that he

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,770
twisted around to look over his shoulder
to maintain his flexibility.

112
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,730
And she said, no, I don't do that.

113
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,540
Well, stretching as you get older can be
very useful thing to maintain your

114
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,610
range of motion for normal activities like
reaching up to a high shelf or driving.

115
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,580
And although stretching doesn't
necessarily reduce injuries as

116
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,510
many people think, it does stimulate the
production of

117
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,650
lubricants between connective tissue
fibers.

118
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,320
It also increases the range of motion by
decreasing the formation of

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,130
adhesions within the connective tissue.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,100
If you are over 50 you are likely starting
to experience some type of minor or

121
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,820
major joint pain, aches, stiffness,
clicking in your joints.

122
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,720
It's true that some of that is inevitable
part of aging.

123
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,930
But it also could be the start of
arthritis.

124
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,450
There are many forms of arthritis but most
common kind in the over 50 crowd is

125
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,849
osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease
known as the wear and tear disease.

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,790
As we get older the rubbery cartilage that
serves as a shock absorber in our joint

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,290
becomes stiff, losses its elasticity, and
becomes more susceptible to damage.

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,180
As the cartilage wears away, we can get
bone on bone rubbing.

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,680
Bone spurs can form in the joint space and
tendons and

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,990
ligaments stretch all causing pain.

131
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,770
It occur, it can occur in almost any joint
in the body.

132
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,180
But most commonly in the fingers, hips,
knees and spine.

133
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,770
There are a number of things that you can
do to limit the severity and

134
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,060
impact of osteoarthritis.

135
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,310
Some are listed in this slide, and I'm
just going to highlight a few.

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,110
Maintain a healthy weight is important
because it decreases the loading on

137
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,870
the joint, but it also because it
decreases systemic inflammation and

138
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,950
has been shown to increase the progression
of osteoarthritis.

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,920
Also, despite the discomfort that exercise
can cause when you have osteoarthritis,

140
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,370
it is important to keep doing it.

141
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,450
It will maintain muscle strength stabilize
the joint and

142
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,040
again reduce systemic inflammation.

143
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,040
Assistive devices can help with particular
joint problems for

144
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,590
example jar openers can be a life saver if
you have impaired hand function.

145
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,280
Also there are new commercially available
shoes that

146
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,290
unload certain portions of the knee while
walking to minimize the pain and

147
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,810
decrease wear on susceptible parts of the
joint.

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh, one more thing on osteoarthritis.

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,390
Despite what many people believe, running
does not cause osteoarthritis.

150
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,760
Several studies of long-term runners
support this.

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,940
However, if problems already exist that
have started this cycle of degeneration,

152
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,620
then repetitive loading exercises can make
it worse.

153
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,450
These problems include previous injuries
such as ACL tears, biomechanical issues,

154
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,650
loose joints, uneven loading, etc.

155
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,050
Once the degeneration has started,
alternative and

156
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,410
varied forms of physical activity are
recommended.

157
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,050
Congratulations!

158
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,060
We did it.

159
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,790
We went through the major body system
changes as they relate to

160
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,360
exercise capacity.

161
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,070
The cardiovascular system, muscles, bones
and joints.

162
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,340
Now we get to see how good physical
activity can be for your brain.

163
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,350
Stay tuned for module six.
