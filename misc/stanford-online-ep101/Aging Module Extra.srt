1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,780
This short bonus module is on the common
cold, or

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,080
otherwise known as upper respiratory tract
infections.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,910
On average, adults in the US get between
two to five colds per year,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,120
resulting in about 250 million days of
restricted activity.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,060
Colds remain the leading cause of doctor
visits and missed work days.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,930
By the way, this is an actual sneeze
that's been back lit.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,215
So the next time someone sneezes in your
direction duck.

8
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:32,290
[LAUGH]

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,630
Your immune system is very sophisticated
and complex.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,370
What's behind me is just part of what's
going on with your immune

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,990
system right now.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,960
You have innate elements that have been
with you to protect you since birth.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,620
They include anatomical barriers not
listed here, like skin and

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,910
mucus membranes.

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,660
As well as the cell-mediated killers like
macro phages and

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,740
natural killer cells, the NK cells.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,190
You also have the Adaptive component that
includes the lymphocytes with

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,770
the T cells and the B cells that find
foreign invaders, and

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,360
not only neutralize them, but then they
stick around as antibodies in

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,440
order to attack the future invaders more
quickly.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
That's how the flu shot works.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,610
You get an injection of weakened or dead
viruses,

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,120
your body mounts an immune response and
produces antibodies to that virus.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,660
If you get infected with the real thing
later, your body's already set to fight.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,050
Your immune system is amazing, built in
protection and

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,650
you didn't even have to pay extra for it.

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,150
Wow!

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,880
What happens to immune function with
exercise is as complex as

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,760
the system itself.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,230
However, there seems to be a general
pattern in which most people agree,

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,280
call the Open Window Hypothesis,
illustrated to my right.

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,320
With moderate exercise, there's a boost in
activity of

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,320
your natural killer cells in the blood, so
the blue line.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,750
The levels then return back to normal
within a matter of

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,210
hours following exercise.

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,260
However, in the case of intense exercise,
there's an initial boost in immune cell

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,970
activity, but then a fall below base line
levels for a period of hours, up to a day.

38
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,950
So if exercise is prolonged or intense,
there's a period following exercise when

39
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,130
an athlete is at greater risk of illness,
the open window as it were.

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,125
If you string many workouts together with
chronic training,

41
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,970
moderate exercise can lead to enhanced
immune function.

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,340
An illustration of this came from a
classic study by David Neiman in which he

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,200
compared upper respiratory track
infections in middle aged women who were

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,370
either put on a 15 week brisk walking
program or who remained sedentary.

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,850
By the end of the study, walkers showed a
40 to 50% reduction in

46
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,430
days with upper respiratory tract
infections.

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,148
In contrast, severe exercise training can
lead to suppressed immune function,

48
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:52,510
elevated cortisol, pro-inflammatory
responses and

49
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,640
micro damage in the tissues with intense
training is thought to

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,040
impair immune function and redirect
Towards tissue repair.

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,040
Thus, non exercisers are at an average
risk, moderate exercisers at reduced risk,

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,330
and then intense exercisers are at
exaggerated risk.

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,929
The concept referred to as the J curve,
illustrated to my right.

54
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,760
So what's an athlete to do?

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,980
You don't have the option of training
moderately.

56
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,080
In order to be competitive,

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,900
you need to go through phases of intense
training and competition.

58
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,080
There are some things you can do to reduce
the risk of illness.

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,910
Again, none of this is rocket science.

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,110
First, train smarter,

61
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,080
not necessarily harder, making sure that
you have adequate periods of rest.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,410
Don't increase your training load by more
than 10% per week and monitor signs of

63
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,120
deterioration in performance which may be
an indication of over training.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,490
Add variety to your training to limit
staleness.

65
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,380
Second, immune function is impacted by
cummulative stress.

66
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,380
So try to keep other life stresses to a
minimum.

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,480
Avoid excessive travel and unnecessarily
stressful events.

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,190
You know, like if your girlfriend or

69
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,145
boyfriend wants to break up with you, tell
them to wait til the end of the season.

70
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:13,100
[LAUGH] Assure optimal nutrition,

71
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,980
especially adequate carbohydrate while
training and competing.

72
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,690
For example, Neeman and others have shown
that

73
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,100
given a carbohydrate during a marathon
race can reduce cortisol levels.

74
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,620
Thus reducing the suppression of immune
function and reducing subsequent colds.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,170
There are a lot of supplements out there
that claim to boost immune function in

76
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,680
athletes, but most of them are not
supported by scientific evidence.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,380
A 2011 review article by Walsh [UNKNOWN],
sorts through the scientific evidence on

78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,330
supplements and does not recommend any of
the usual suspects like vitamin C,

79
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,320
vitamin E, ecanacia, glutamine, multi
vitamins etc.

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,500
But there are a couple interesting
exceptions.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,440
If you'd like to look at the data on
these, the Walsh review paper is

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,940
sited in the resource section, under the
title maintaining immune function.

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,825
Actually, maintaining immune health.

84
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:08,510
[LAUGH] Fourth, contrary to what many
people believe, you won't increase

85
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,570
your risk of getting a cold by exercising
in the cold or hot environments.

86
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,885
Go ahead, walk around in the cold with wet
hair.

87
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:21,480
[LAUGH] However, certain scientists argue
that increased movement of cold,

88
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,630
dry air in and out of the lungs during
heavy exercise in

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,440
the cold can damage the sensitive
respiratory membranes and

90
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,050
make them more susceptible to infection by
colds.

91
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,080
In addition at altitude, there may be a
slight suppression of

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,960
cell mediated immunity as your body tries
to cope with the additional stress.

93
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,490
Adequate sleep is important, but not
necessarily in the short term.

94
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,600
Studies of up to three days of sleep
deprivation suggest little impact on

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,070
immune function.

96
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,280
However, long term chronic sub-optimal
sleep quantity and

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,720
quality, may lead to increased risk of
illness.

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,890
But the data is pretty scarce on that
topic.

99
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,905
Finally, getting the flu shot can help and
my personal favorite, avoid sick people.

100
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:15,210
[LAUGH] I realize that the last one's kind
of ridiculous, but just keep it in mind.

101
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,760
For example, if you've just completed a
long,

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,160
intense run outside, you may not want to
do your cool down on

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,730
a treadmill in the gym next to the guy
who's hacking up a lung.

104
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,260
Just a thought.

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,010
I've presented information so far on
preventing infections, but

106
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,970
what happens if you already have a cold.

107
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,090
Is it safe to exercise?

108
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,740
To answer that, physicians generally apply
the above the neck rule.

109
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,760
Meaning, if your symptoms are all in your
head.

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,360
So, stuffy nose, headaches,

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,700
scratchy throat, then it's probably okay
to exercise if you feel like it.

112
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,630
Keep the exercise below 65% of your
maximum though, so

113
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,400
you're in the immune boosting, rather than
immune suppression range.

114
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,970
Keep in mind that certain cough and cold
medicines can increase your heart rate.

115
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,450
So be careful with your intensity.

116
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,080
However if an illness feels systemic.

117
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,230
Meaning you have fever, muscle aches,
chest congestion, or

118
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,900
especially a bad sore throat.

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,170
Which can indicate strep throat, you
should definitely take time off to rest.

120
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,800
A few days of missed training won't impact
your performance as much as

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,340
perpetuating the flu, bronchitis, or
worse, for weeks.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,160
Some common wisdom about colds is true,
get lots of rest,

123
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,740
drink lots of fluid, avoid getting overly
stressed, both physically and emotionally.

124
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,250
Your body will need energy to fight the
cold, so

125
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,550
if you're exhausted from other causes, you
will prolong the illness.

126
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,590
That's it.

127
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,080
That's all I've got for this module.

128
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,660
Stay healthy.
