1
00:00:01,098 --> 00:00:05,110
[SOUND] It's kind of a relief to get out
of the cold and into the heat.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,180
>> Yeah, cold is a tough section.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,050
>> Yeah.
But it was a great week because you came

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,230
into the class and you started posting
comments and questions.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,690
And that got us all excited.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,460
And you seem to be enjoying the class,
which made us very happy.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,340
So thank you for that.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,360
>> And we've gotta say, we've, we were
both really impressed with how thoughtful

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,770
and challenging a lot of your questions
were and it's really rewarding for us to

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,460
be, to be able to monitor and participate
in some of the discussion forum threads.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,080
the, there's been a lot of work coming up
to this point to be

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,950
able to offer the class.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,650
And this week was just, for both Anne and
I, just really exciting.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,040
We're just super grateful that we have the
opportunity to share this with you,

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,550
and that it seems like many of you are
getting something out of it.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,030
>> Yeah.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,800
And we wish we could reply to every
question and every comment, but

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,590
unfortunately there are only a couple of
us and so that's a little hard to do.

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,350
And so, it'd be great if you guys could
start helping each other out.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,310
There's some questions on there I think
other people could answer and

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,550
then we'll try and get in on some of those
longer discussions and

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,440
give in our two cents when we get the
opportunity.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,090
>> Mm-hm, I think the best thing about the
discussion forum is really for

24
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,860
you guys to be able to converse with one
another.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,140
And a great way to do that is instead of
making your own separate thread for

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,020
each question, just search for previous
threads that are related to the topic

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,490
that you are going to be bringing up, to
see if something already exists, and

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,830
that way you can start a conversation or
continue a conversation.

29
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,540
Rather than start your own.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,780
>> And it's so great that we have 144
countries represented from around

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,260
the world in this class because as you may
have noticed with the posts from

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,440
last week, people who live in Canada and
Siberia were expressing their

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,405
experiences in the cold and people from,
you know, India were saying, really?

34
00:01:56,405 --> 00:02:00,730
[LAUGH] And so now it's going to shift
because this week we have issues of

35
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,580
heat and so all those people who live in,
in hot climates can help those people out

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,950
in the cold who may not have experienced
those same things.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,160
>> Yeah, so this week we're looking
forward to the physiology of heat.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,020
We go back to the Heller Lab and,
unfortunately for me,

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,790
it was probably just as challenging.

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,710
[LAUGH] As the physiology of cold.

41
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,870
I appreciate the sympathy that some of you
extended to me.

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,670
>> Poor Corey.

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,955
>> Poor Corey.

44
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:25,180
[LAUGH] Physiology and heat was a little
bit tough, too.

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,160
>> Yeah, so keep it up, stay engaged.

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,810
Hope you enjoy the heat like you enjoyed
the cold and,

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,860
we'll see you on the other side.

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,368
>> Oh wait, real quick, Dr. Beth.

49
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,150
What was your favorite thing that happened
this week?

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,900
Physiology of cold.

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,140
>> Well for me, the favorite thing was
that first post that came through

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,750
when we realized there was somebody out
there in the world paying attention.

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,950
That was very exciting and then they came
flooding in and so, that was my favorite.

54
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,900
How about you?

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,320
>> I want to give a shout out to the
participant who made the Titanic post.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,800
>> because I know you were going to say
that.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,310
>> I was, I absolutely loved the
creativity that went into that post.

58
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,610
Looking at the risks of hypothermia and
how if Rose and Jack had only known.

59
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,070
Then perhaps their romance would still be
alive today.

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,210
>> Yeah.

61
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,712
It's Cory's favorite movie.

62
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,470
[LAUGH]
>> That's embarrassing.

63
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,170
No, it's not.

64
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,350
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.

65
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,480
>> Alright, maybe it is.

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,490
>> Alright, see you out there.

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,380
>> Bye.
>> Bye.
