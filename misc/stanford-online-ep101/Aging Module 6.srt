1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,540
Get ready to maintain your brain.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,740
In this category, exercise is huge.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,970
And, I'm not just talking about mental
exercise,

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,640
like doing the New York Times crossword
puzzle.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,620
I'm also talking about physical exercise.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,300
In fact, when I was working at the
Stanford Center on longevity.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,060
We brought in a panel of brain and
cognition experts to

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,590
evaluate whether online brain games worked
to improve cognition.

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,940
There were varied opinions on that topic.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,070
But the one thing that they all agreed on
was that physical activity was,

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,470
without a doubt, beneficial to brain
health.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,830
So rather than playing an online training
game,

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,740
use that 30 minutes to go out for a walk.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,650
Hmm.

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,600
Now I'm feeling guilty about asking you to
sit inside watching this video online.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,450
Oh well, I'm over it.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,790
Let's look at how your brain changes with
age and why physical activity can help.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,810
Okay folks, I've got some bad news for
you.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,440
Size does matter.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,970
For the majority of you out there, your
brain is shrinking.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,510
In general, if you're a young adult it's
shrinking about .12% per year.

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,040
If you're over 50, it's disappearing at a
rate about three times that per year.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,050
Some regions are relatively stable, but
others like your hippocampus, which

25
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,520
plays a major role in memory formation,
can shrink more than 1% per year after 50.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,430
Bummer.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,310
You can't see your brain shrinking unless
you have an MRI scanner in your garage.

28
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,400
But if you're over 40, you've probably
noticed that you just can't

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,580
problem solve or remember as well as you
used to.

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,800
My friends and I joke about this all of
the time.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,530
Let me describe a scenario for your, you
and see if it sounds familiar.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,550
You want to go to the store, but you need
to get your grocery list from the kitchen.

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,390
You pick up your keys and walk into the
kitchen to get the list.

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,060
By the time you make it from the living
room to the kitchen,

35
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,080
you can't remember why you're in, in the
kitchen to begin with.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,070
However, you see the mail on the table, so
you put your keys down and

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,950
pick up the mail, you sort through some
mail, but

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,230
then remember you're on your way to the
store.

39
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,280
You put the mail down on top of your keys,
you leave the kitchen.

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,570
Now you're back in the living room, you
still don't have your list,

41
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,480
you can't find your car keys, and you're
no closer to getting to the store.

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,210
If you're over 40, you're probably nodding
and chuckling.

43
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,020
If you're under 40, you probably have no
idea what I'm talking about.

44
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,940
But you will eventually.

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,550
Trust me.

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,500
Most of the time,

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,070
these charming characteristics are a
normal part of aging.

48
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,900
Elements of cognitive function, like
executive control,

49
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,726
which includes tasks like scheduling and
planning .

50
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,477
.
.or your working memory, or

51
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:44,557
controlled functioning, which keeps you on
task,

52
00:02:44,557 --> 00:02:49,790
without getting distracted by a pile of
mail, all decline slowly with age.

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,370
But, the rate of decline and function,
even the structural changes in the brain,

54
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,380
can be impacted by a variety of behavioral
factors.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,060
Most scientists agree that three lifestyle
factors in

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,070
particular can slow the rate of cognitive
decline and prevent dementia.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,670
The first of the big three is to be
socially active and engaged.

58
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,660
So interact with your friends, have a
social support network, and

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,819
don't isolate yourself away from the
world.

60
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,060
Second is to engage in cognitive leisure
activities like learning to

61
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,530
play an instrument, learning a new
language, building something new for fun.

62
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,080
Some types of employment work can help
too, but

63
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,149
there needs to be a creative and
constantly changing component to it.

64
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,690
Basically, you want your brain to be
learning new things and

65
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,910
the more different those things are, the
better.

66
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,540
The final one on the list is to perform
regular physical activity.

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,120
At this time, physical activity has the
most support of

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,780
anything as a means to combat age
associated cognitive decline.

69
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,490
There was a nice review paper by Hillman
et al that came out in

70
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,520
Nature Neuroscience Reviews in 2008.

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,480
The authors reviewed the scientific
literature looking for rigorous studies

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,430
investigating the effects of physical
activity on brain function in adults.

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,820
Data from their summary are presented to
my right.

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,720
The effect size is how much better the
different task got in response to

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,380
the intervention.

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,700
The bar suggest there is a small effect on
cognitive function just from being in

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,660
the control group of the studies.

78
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,370
Probably resulting from increase practice
on the task over the course of

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,890
the studies.

80
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,270
On the other hand, there was a medium to
large effect of

81
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,060
the exercise interventions on cognitive
performance.

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,560
The biggest improvement came in the
Executive Function Task category, so

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,870
being able to plan and deal with the
unknown.

84
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,450
This review study is supported by many
other, more recent studies,

85
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,040
that show benefits of physical activity on
brain structures and function.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,750
By the way, physical activity and

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,130
fitness doesn't just improve cognitive
health in older adults.

88
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,550
It is correlated with academic performance
like reading and math in children as well.

89
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,390
Enhanced metabolic activity in the regions
of the brain responsible for

90
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,910
those academic skills can be seen with
exercise in children.

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,300
And data shows that a single bout of 20
minutes of

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,970
walking right before a test can improve
children's test scores.

93
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,990
Also, fitter kids, even within identical
twins have bigger

94
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,090
hippocampal and basoganglia regions of the
brain, and higher test scores

95
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,090
even when socioeconomic Body composition
and other factors are controlled.

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,610
So its ironic that in order to improve
standardized test scores in kids, physical

97
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,540
education is being cut out of schedules to
make room for more academic time.

98
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,865
In reality, it may be making scores worse,
just some food for thought.

99
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:01,440
[NOISE]

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,570
As an exercise physiologist, I sort of
ignored the brain for a while.

101
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,150
I was focused more on the body and

102
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,520
the brain was this separate thing way up
in your head.

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,900
However, I've changed my thinking over the
years because of the obvious and

104
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,389
strong connections between body and brain.

105
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,670
Even Plato, back around 400 B.C. could see
the relationship and

106
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,600
is quoted as saying, in order for man to
succeed in life,

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,120
God provided him with two means: education
and physical activity.

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,130
Not separately, one for the soul and

109
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,680
the other for the body, but for the two
together.

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,930
With these two means man can attain
perfection.

111
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,060
That was my Plato voice.

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,750
Clearly, the bidirectional connection
between body and

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,270
brain has been generally understood for a
long time.

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,960
The brain impacts the body in terms of
health, well-being, and physical

115
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,420
performance, and the body impacts the
brain in terms of its size and function.

116
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,610
However, it's only more recently with the
new brain imaging techniques that we've

117
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,610
been able to investigate the mechanisms of
the connection.

118
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,430
It's not really a surprise, but

119
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,590
it turns out that many of the same things
that improve the health of

120
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,950
our bodies with exercise also improve the
health of our brains.

121
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,270
[BLANK_AUDIO]

122
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,050
Physical activity has been shown in
animals and

123
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,190
some human studies to directly affect the
biological properties of the brain.

124
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,120
Exercise causes the release of important
growth factors, such as, IGF1 and

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,330
VegF and brain derived nuerotropic factor
BDNF.

126
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,760
Together these factors increase the
formation of new blood vessels so

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,120
angiogenesis and new neurons; neurogenesis
the former supplies more nutrients

128
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,860
to the brain and the ladder creates more
circuitry in the brain that facilitates or

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,180
makes learning easier.

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,350
The BDNF is reduced with age, Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's, depression,

131
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,160
anorexia, but as I just mentioned,
exercise increases it.

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,510
Also, exercise reduces low grade,

133
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,170
background inflammation in our bodies
which is

134
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,080
good because inflammation inhibits the
activity of those growth factors.

135
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,390
Growth factors lead to better brain
circuitry and

136
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,600
even preservation of brain mass, the
amount of brain you have, over time.

137
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,115
One of the first studies to support this
idea was a 2003 study by Colcombe et al.

138
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:31,880
It demonstrated that higher cardiovascular
fitness was associated with

139
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,600
reduced loss of gray and white matter.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,150
In various regions of the brain in older
adults.

141
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,160
There also indirect mechanisms that
connect physical activity in

142
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,910
cognitive functions.

143
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,850
For example increased cardiovascular
fitness improves cardiac output and

144
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,760
vascularization, excuse me to the brain.

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,690
Increased energy expenditure can reduce
the risk of obesity,

146
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,190
cardiovascular disease.

147
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,430
type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and
again, inflammation.

148
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,460
Those together reduce vascular disease and
increase blood flow and

149
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,800
nutrients to the brain, to allow some
serious power thinking.

150
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,010
In addition, there may be indirect effects
because of the improved sleep,

151
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,160
increased sense of well being, self
efficacy, and

152
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,360
decreased stress associated with regular
physical activity.

153
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,370
We've established that physical activity
can maintain your brain, but

154
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,890
what happens if you already have some mild
cognitive impairment?

155
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,640
Can it still help?

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,410
Apparently, yes.

157
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,150
The loss of cognitive function can be
slowed even

158
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,540
in people who already have symptoms of
mild cognitive impairments.

159
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,700
And perhaps even more extraordinary,

160
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,780
is the observation that cardiovascular
fitness is associated with

161
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,500
better cognition in brain size even in
early stage Alzheimers patients.

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,990
So the protective affect is indeed
powerful.

163
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,490
Another important benefit of physical
activity is a rediction in depression.

164
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,990
A recent review of the literature suggests
that both aerobic and resistance exercise

165
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,615
can improve depressive symptoms as
affectively as either drug psychotherapy.

166
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,810
The higher the intensity of exercise, the
better the outcome.

167
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,700
Further, if exercise is continued for the
long term, it's more effective at

168
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,540
preventing a relapse in symptoms in either
of the other two.

169
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,480
It's amazing.

170
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,730
Information on which activities are the
best for

171
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,480
these benefits is hard to come by.

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,170
We do know that aerobic or

173
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,750
endurance training consistently shows
benefits in terms of cognitive function,

174
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,350
whereas resistance training shows less
reliable beneficial effects.

175
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,330
Unfortunately, how much, how long, and

176
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,230
how often you need to exercise is not
fully understood.

177
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,950
More comparison studies are currently
underway, so,

178
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,580
hopefully, we'll have some more answers
for you soon.

179
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,520
And, finally, exercising, in groups, has
the added benefit of social interaction,

180
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,720
one of the big three we talked about.

181
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,030
But, research has shown that exercising,
at home, and

182
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,089
on your own, can also be effective.

183
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,650
Before we move on,

184
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,930
I'd like to remind you of something
important about aging and the brain.

185
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,050
It's easy to get caught up in the negative
aspects of the physiology of aging.

186
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,950
But we can't forget about the good side of
aging too.

187
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,210
We talked about brain shrinkage, memory
impairments,

188
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,130
how your brain becomes less nimble and
adaptable to new situations as you age.

189
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,020
But, at the same time, you gain more
experience and

190
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,140
knowledge on a wide variety of topics.

191
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,550
As a result, older adults frequently make
better decisions.

192
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,150
Show better judgement and have better
social skills.

193
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,280
Further, psychological studies have shown
that older adults, between 60 and

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,600
80, are more emotionally balanced.

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,310
Demonstrating better understanding of
their feelings.

196
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,180
Developing strategies to regulate their
emotions and

197
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,419
showing a higher degree of emotional
control than their younger counterparts.

198
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,660
And finally, counter to what many people
believe,

199
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,000
research suggests older adults are
actually happier than younger people.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,540
Young people have that pressure of all
that ambiguity about the life, their life.

201
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,830
What will they do, who will their life
partner be, will they succeed?

202
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,730
The human brain doesn't like the unknown.

203
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,620
Studies out of Lora Carsinson's lab out of
Stanford have show as people's time

204
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,750
horizon shorten, meaning they get closer
to death, they focus more on the positive,

205
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,730
they live in the moment, they savor life,
and as a result, are happier.

206
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,970
I don't have time here to go into the
details of these studies, but

207
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,960
they're quite compelling.

208
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,120
There's an interesting 10 minute Ted talk
on the topic by Dr. Carstensen,

209
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,070
who's the director of the Stanford Center
of Longevity,

210
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,090
that is linked in the resources at the end
of this section.

211
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,819
Take a look if you have the time and the
interest.

212
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,540
So anyway, the bottom line is that aging
is not easy in many ways.

213
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,140
But there are good things that come with
it as well.

214
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,550
These positive changes related to
experience and

215
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,750
emotion are not insignificant.

216
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,870
Experience does pay off.

217
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,690
That's all for now.

218
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,730
Before you move onto module 7 on aging
disease and

219
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,090
physical activity go boost your brain
power by running around with a group of

220
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,000
friends while learning a new activity.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,430
See you in a bit thanks.
