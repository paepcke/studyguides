00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,700
[LAUGH] [SOUND] Welcome back to the
physiology of stress.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,230
Today, stress gets hormonal, and

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,590
we're going to unpack the role of hormones
in the stress response.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,800
And this is our roadmap for this mini
lecture.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,110
We're going to start with a quick overview
of the hypothalamic pituitary access.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,820
The slow stress response.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,610
And then talk about some of the major
hormones involved in getting stressed,

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,640
relating each one along the way, or

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,130
as many as possible to Dr. Freelander and
her experience at Skydive LasVegas.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:42,230
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,480
I'm starting to feel nervous.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,770
How are you feeling?
>> I'm not nervous.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,880
>> The doctor's nervous, I'm nervous.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,780
Let's see what happens.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,761

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,840
>> Standing in the landing field doing
science.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Freelander lab, we can go anywhere.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,655
>> Anytime, anywhere!

20
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:23,900
>> A big part of Anne's stress experience
is

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,710
mediated by these important hormones that
characterize the stress response.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,530
We took blood from Dr.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,830
Freelander to measure hormone levels at
various points during her experience

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,712
to give us a picture of how they play a
role in stress response.

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,160
The data next to me give you an image,

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,420
an idea of her changes in hormone levels
approximately ten minutes post-jump.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,360
From the plane compared to her baseline
levels which we took on a previous day.

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,710
Within this time frame you see some pretty
changes in blood levels of

29
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,320
these stress hormones.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,290
Doubling tripling and sometimes increasing
by an order of 92.

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:13,840
The hypofolamic putuitary access is a set
of connections.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,140
An interactions between the hypothalamus,
the pituitary gland and adrenal gland.

33
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,510
It represents a connection between the
nervous system and the endocrine system.

34
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,620
And is involved in regulating many
processes including the stress response.

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,840
The HPA Axis results in a release of the
famous stress hormone cortisol.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,740
And this is how it does it.

37
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,610
The hypothalamus releases CRH, or
Corticotropin Releasing Hormone,

38
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,540
which stimulates the Anterior Pituitary to
release Adrenocorticotropic Hormone

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,330
from the Anterior Pituitary, which is
released into the blood stream and

40
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,040
eventually stimulates the Adrenal Cortex,
to release, Cortisol into the bloodstream.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,750
The green forward arrows represent the
feed to forward signals that increase

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,790
production and

43
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,950
the blue lines represent the feedback
signals that reduce hormonal production.

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,590
Its a little messy and complicated but
really the important point that I

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,870
want you to take away, is that the brain
controls the release of these hormones.

46
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,820
And, it's controlled and regulated at
various levels.

47
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,320
As you remember from the previous mini
lecture,

48
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,730
the sympathetic nervous system has nerve
connections that synapse directly onto

49
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,030
the body organs that are affected by the
stress response.

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,870
This includes nerves that reach to the
adrenal medulla signaling for

51
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,710
the quick release of hormones,
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,370
The diagram, the left side of which,

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,350
demonstrates how the HPA access leads to
the production of cortisol.

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,330
Passing chemical signals through the blood
stream from

55
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,030
the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary
and then to the adrenal cortex.

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,700
The cortisol is released into the blood.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,520
In contrast, very fast electrical signals
of

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,750
the sympathetic nervous system The signals
carried throughout the HPA axis

59
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,060
are much slower taking on the order of
minutes and longer to have their effect.

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,900
Epinephrine and its support hormone,
norepinephrine, account for

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,178
much of the immediate and short term
effects on stress response.

62
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,670
Target organs and tissues of the
sympathetic chain release Norepinephrine

63
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,950
right at the site of activation.

64
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,330
These hormones often referred to as
Catecholamines are the first

65
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,450
wave of stress hormones that activate
second

66
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,560
messenger cascades within moments to
seconds.

67
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,370
They are also released in the blood stream
by the adrenal medulla accounting for

68
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,720
activation of body organs, on a more
intermediate timeframe, like 30 seconds.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Tissues from the head to the toe tend to
be really dense in

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,060
these catecholamine receptors, causing
changes all over the body.

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,850
You can see the increase in catecholamine
levels in Anne's blood, right next to me.

72
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,870
At ten minutes post skydive,

73
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,000
you see significant increases in
catecholamine levels in our blood.

74
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,810
These catecholamines signal for

75
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,660
an increase of energy breakdown in the
muscle, preparing the body for action.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,400
These catecholamines commonly called
adrenaline.

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,620
Are largely to thank for helping us
recruit massive amount of

78
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,070
bodily resources, in a short period of
time.

79
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,890
Now glucocorticoids like cortisol, are the
second hormone wave of the stress,

80
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,490
stress response, and they have an impact
on a longer time frame,

81
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,420
pushing from minutes to hours.

82
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,440
The HPA access releases glucocorticoids
like cortisol and aldosterone.

83
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,350
Though we didn't measure aldosterone in
Ann, it's a hormone that

84
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,460
helps the body retain fluids, increasing
blood pressure and cardiac output.

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,560
The release of cortisol happens on a much
slower time frame.

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,000
As indicated by Anne's blood cortisol data
at ten minutes post jump.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We likely measured Anne's peak catoclamine
levels, her peak cortisol

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,500
levels probably were still on the rise at
the time of our measurement.

89
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,860
So once the HPA access stimulates the
adrenal cortex,

90
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,659
we have an increase of cortisol floating
around in our bloodstream.

91
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,050
So, what happens next?

92
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,680
What does cortisol do upon acute exposure?

93
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,920
One of it's major actions is to act as a
catabolic signal.

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,750
Cortisol signals for the breakdown of fats
and proteins.

95
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,450
It signals for increased breakdown of this
stored energy resulting in

96
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,130
a rise in serum glucose fatty acids and
amino acids.

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,950
Having access to this energy is absolutely
crucial to be able to run or

98
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,750
fight in response to a stressful
situation.

99
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,070
Especially once our short term energy
stores are low.

100
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,980
Cortisol helps promote the other aspects
of the stress response

101
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,790
by signaling peripheral vasoconstriction,
promoting an increase in blood pressure.

102
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,050
It also reduces inflammation and shuts
down things like the reproductive system.

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,820
Have you ever had the experience where you
were so into a sporting even or

104
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,350
a game competition and you didn't realize
that you actually got cut,

105
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,520
or otherwise minorly injured.

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Do you ever wonder, how sometimes, you're
watching athletes push through

107
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,370
great injury in that big game, when they
feel like everything is on the line?

108
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,440
In Anne's case, skydiving, we did a pain
stressor test.

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,370
Where we placed Anne's hand, into freezing
ice water.

110
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,830
Something that reliably generates pain in,
in the middle of the hand.

111
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,910
In her case, after she activated a stress
response sky diving,

112
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,830
she was able to do something really
strange.

113
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,310
She was able to tolerate more pain.

114
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,160
Among other things,

115
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,439
endorphins could help us understand how
humans can deal with that.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,410
Otherwise great pain during times of
stress.

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,490
Endorphin's are endogenous opiates
released by the brain and

118
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,170
body during times of stress that have a
natural pain suppressing effect.

119
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Endorphin's suppress pain by breaking the
path of pain information in the brain.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,600
Preventing pain signals from the lower
body from reaching the processing centers

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,020
that otherwise inform you that way.

122
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,950
Oxytocin is another interesting hormone
associated with stress response.

123
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,990
It's a neuropeptide released by the
pituitary along with

124
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,010
other pituitary hormones and you might be
familiar with it because,

125
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,280
Oxytocin has gotten a lot of love in the
media.

126
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,590
It's affectionately referred to as the
cuddle hormone, or the love hormone.

127
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,100
It's presented as a hormone that promotes
human connection and human touch.

128
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,620
Recent studies have associated increased
oxytocin with an amelioration or

129
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,680
a reduction in stress response.

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,400
While promoting human connection.

131
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,250
It may be that one stresses over oxytocin
helps us return to baseline.

132
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,590
After all, we aren't meant to be stressed
for

133
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,700
more than just short periods at a time.

134
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,940
Oxytocin may promote seeking out resources
to return back to baseline after stress.

135
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,280
From your own personal experience, this
might make a lot of sense to you.

136
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,770
What do you do when you're really stressed
out?

137
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,510
For many of you, you probably go to a
parent, maybe you go to a sibling,

138
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,780
maybe you have a best friend you confide
in or a partner.

139
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,020
We tend to seek out the touch, the
empathy,

140
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,740
the listening, the comfort of others.

141
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,440
And that social support helps mellow out
that stress response.

142
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,560
At least in part oxytocin could be
deriving that behavior.

143
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,940
Hormones are the great carriers of
information that signal optimization of

144
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,530
the body, to deal with life's greatest
challenges.

145
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,906
They are the players in the trenches
making a stress response happen.

146
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:23,388
Mobilizing energy, Inhibiting pain and
even, looking out for

147
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,440
your best interest, once stress is over.

148
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:34,565
I'll see you in the next one.
