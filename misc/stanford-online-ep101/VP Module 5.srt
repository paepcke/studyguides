1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,280
The last module, space.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,360
I was going to try to describe what it's
like to be in space.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,430
But, who am I kidding?

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,850
I've never been to space.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,320
Although, if given the opportunity, I'd
take it.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,780
Do you think that Stanford would foot the
bill for that one?

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,810
Mm, probably not.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,740
Anyway, I realized that it would be much
more compelling to

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,650
hear from astronauts who have actually
been to space,

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,870
thus the radio app episode that you
hopefully listened to.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,120
In the resources, I've also linked an
interview with Chris Hadfield,

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,430
who last year returned from a 144 days in
space

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,415
commanding the International Space
Station.

14
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:40,890
He's the famous Canadian astronaut who
performed and

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,140
filmed a version of David Bowie's Space
Oddity while in space, in a space station.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,700
The music video's great.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,660
It gave you the chills.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,130
But I'm kind of geeky about space.

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,350
I've provided a link to the music video in
the resources as well.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,319
But since 20 million of you have already
seen it, it may not be new to many of you.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,620
With the environmental conditions covered
by the experts,

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,390
I'm just going to talk about one little
physics thing, and then the physiology.

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,730
I'll make it short and sweet for this
final module.

24
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,919
Microgravity is a condition where people
or objects appear weightless.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,030
It's sometimes referred to as zero
gravity, but

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,070
that's technically not accurate.

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,500
A small amount of gravity can be found
even way out in outer space.

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,660
Gravity is the natural force of a
celestial body that

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,310
pulls an object towards its center.

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,869
The bigger and closer the object, the
stronger the gravitational force.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,760
The reason things appear weightless with
our astronauts on

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,480
the International Space Station is not
because they're so

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,000
far from Earth that the gravitational
force is minimal.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,170
The space station is in orbit only about
200 to 250 miles from Earth.

35
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,479
Gravity there is about 90% of what we feel
here on Earth.

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,070
So, what gives the astronauts the
appearance of weightlessness is

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,450
that they're actually in constant free
fall.

38
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,000
But, everything else around them is also
in constant free fall.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,480
Here's an example.

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,235
If you were to jump off a cliff and

41
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:12,845
released a ball in front of you at the
same time, and

42
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,780
I'm not recommending that you do this, the
ball would appear to be floating in

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,360
front of you, traveling at the same speed
as you plummeted to your death.

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,600
In the vacuum of space, objects fall at

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,230
the same speed because there's no air
resistance to slow any objects down.

46
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,950
Since everything is falling at the same
speed,

47
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,580
it gives the appearance of floating.

48
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,130
So if the space station is falling, why
doesn't it hit the Earth?

49
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,770
Well, it is also traveling really fast,
about 17,500 miles an hour.

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,630
It's trying to go straight because of its
momentum, but

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,730
Earth's gravity is pulling it down.

52
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,720
The result is the compromise of the blue
orbit line illustrated to my right.

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,070
It's moving at a speed that matches the
Earth's surface curve, so

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,490
it never makes contact.

55
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,460
If it were to go too fast, it would spin
out of the orbit.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,910
If it were to go too slow,

57
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,420
it would be pulled towards the Earth, hit
the Earth atmosphere, and burn up.

58
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,190
Fortunately, for

59
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,770
the moment, it's right in that sweet spot
of speeds to keep it in orbit.

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,510
What do you think?

61
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,880
Is it possible to achieve microgravity on
earth?

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
You probably already have.

63
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,550
Have you ever driven a bit too fast over a
hill and

64
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,240
it feels like the car is lifting off the
ground?

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,075
Ever been on a roller coaster?

66
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,710
Descended in one of those really,

67
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,860
really fast express elevators that leaves
your stomach in your throat?

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,240
You're experiencing a brief moment of
weightlessness in those moments.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,960
Also, NASA's figured out a way to achieve
slightly longer

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,180
weightlessness here on Earth.

71
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,720
They've created a special research plan
affectionately referred to

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,230
as the Vomit Comet for obvious reasons.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,940
It can simulate microgravity by flying
repeated parabolas in the sky.

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,760
A schematic is pictured to me on the left.

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
As the plane goes up, it experiences
almost two Gs, but

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,050
when it reaches the top of its arc and
starts to come down, people in

77
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,790
the plane experience a microgravity
environment for 20 to 30 seconds.

78
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,300
Astronauts train in the Vomit Comet,
researchers and

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,390
students do short experiments, and

80
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,650
directors in Hollywood use it to film
parts of their space movies.

81
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,840
What do you think?

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,740
Should that be the next Corey story video?

83
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,400
Barf bags for everyone, especially me
apparently.

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,780
Let's talk about what happens when

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,620
human bodies are exposed to the almost
complete vacuum of space.

86
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,290
We'll start with an easy one.

87
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,860
As you can imagine, breathing is a
problem.

88
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,940
It's not that gas exchange doesn't occur,

89
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,790
it's that it occurs in the wrong
direction.

90
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,700
Because gases travel from high to low
pressure, and

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,490
there's essentially no breathable oxygen
in space, the oxygen would be

92
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,550
sucked out of your blood through your
lungs into space very rapidly.

93
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,020
It would take about nine to 12 seconds for

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,800
that deoxygenated blood to get from your
lungs to your brain,

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,750
causing you to blackout, and a couple more
minutes after that for you to die.

96
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,880
So my practical tip for you on this is,
keep your spacesuit on.

97
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,270
An even greater incentive to keep your
spacesuit on, and in working order,

98
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,440
is the risk of rapid decompression.

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,360
Because of the low ambient pressures,
without a spacesuit, fluids and

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,500
gases in the body begin to expand,

101
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,010
causing the body to blow up to about two
times its size within about ten seconds.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,580
Also, rapid evaporate of cooling will
cause frost to

103
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,640
form on any exposed body fluid, mouth,
lungs, sweat, etc.

104
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,770
Rapid decompression is not pretty, so
let's move on.

105
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,130
Weightlessness leads to Space Adaptation
Syndrome, or space sickness.

106
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,930
No longer having the force of gravity
pulling on your

107
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,480
inner ear vestibular system really messes
with you.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,140
About 70% of astronauts experience nausea,
vomiting, and

109
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,930
vertigo for up to 72 hours upon arriving
at the space station.

110
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,390
Eventually, the body resolved the conflict
between what is seen and

111
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,420
what is being felt, and will start to
relearn which way is

112
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,430
up based on visual queues, like where your
feet are.

113
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,630
Fluid shifts happen rapidly in
weightlessness.

114
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,630
As we discussed in the G force module,
your body's used to

115
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,310
having your blood pulled down toward your
feet with the force of gravity.

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,380
We have a lot of mechanisms that allow us
to keep that blood flowing back up to

117
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,980
the heart and brain.

118
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,950
But what happens when all of sudden, that
force is reduced, like in negative Gs,

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,520
or removed, like in weightlessness?

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,670
The fluids get redistributed back up to
our heads and

121
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,210
torsos, causing bulging neck veins, puffy
moon faces, and nasal congestion.

122
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,870
When I was asked to consult with NASA, it
was for

123
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,660
a research study that was trying to come
up with exercise countermeasures or

124
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,220
equipment that would help with the fluid
shift problems in weightlessness.

125
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,560
The study design was to have volunteers
lie in a bed for one month, with 15%

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,160
head down tilt to mimic the effects of
fluid shifts that take place in space.

127
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,460
The participants were allowed to get up on
one elbow to eat three times a day,

128
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,870
but that was it.

129
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,850
Exercise, reading, talking, whatever had
to be done in the head down position.

130
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,200
Can you imagine for a month?

131
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,300
That's real dedication by the
participants.

132
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,250
Apparently, that was not the first time
NASA had used a protocol like that, and

133
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,850
they had no problem getting volunteers.

134
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,910
So, thank you to all of you out there who
contribute to science in so many ways.

135
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,940
Fluid shifts don't just give you a puffy
face.

136
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,790
The fluid shifts can impact vision by
changing the shape of the eyeballs and

137
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,820
pressing on the optic nerve.

138
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,420
It can also affect possibly taste,
although we don't know why, and balance.

139
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,999
Sleep is also challenging in space.

140
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:14,890
Circadian rhythms are disrupted by the
90-minute day-night cycle in space.

141
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,475
And nausea and soreness can make sleeping
difficult.

142
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:22,060
It's also light and loud on the space
station with lots of fans and

143
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,739
motors running.

144
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,710
Also, when sleeping in weightlessness,
there is no plopping down on the mattress.

145
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,510
You may as well sleep on the ceiling.

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,940
An astronaut just needs something to clip
themselves onto so they don't float away.

147
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,980
But many choose to sleep in secured
sleeping bags in

148
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,039
the private sleeping room.

149
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,270
Sleep dee, sleep deprivation is a major
problem for

150
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,880
astronauts, and sleeping pills are the
second most common drug tape,

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,380
taken on the Space Station after pain
medication.

152
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,095
Once you've been up in space for a while,
you have to worry about some

153
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:00,720
long-term changes that may not be good for
your health.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,250
First, let's talk about muscle.

155
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,050
Muscle is responsive to the forces placed
upon it,

156
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,350
that's why strength training causes muscle
hypertrophy.

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,420
So, look at me standing here.

158
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,250
I'm not really doing anything except
keeping myself from falling down.

159
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,150
But in order to do that, I'm using muscles
in my feet,

160
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,860
my calves, quads, torso, abdomen, and
back.

161
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,470
Now imagine me floating around this, the,
the space station all limp.

162
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,070
I'd no longer be using any of those
muscles.

163
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,730
As a result, when astronauts go up in
space, their muscles atrophy quickly.

164
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,040
If they don't exercise regularly, they can
lose up to 20% of their

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,400
muscle mass in key areas like back and
legs within five to 11 days.

166
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,900
Yikes.

167
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,150
Bone is also laid down in the direction of
mechanical stress.

168
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,510
But when weightless, all of a sudden,
there's minimal skeletal loading.

169
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,720
Bone can be lost at a rate of
approximately 1.5% per month,

170
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
if counter measures aren't taken.

171
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,347
After a three to four month trip into
space,

172
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,970
it used to take astronauts two to three
years to re,

173
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,270
regain their bone mass after returning to
Earth, and some never fully recovered.

174
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,990
Also, all the calcium that is taken out of
the bone during the resorption or

175
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,860
breakdown period ends up circulating
around the body,

176
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,570
causing calcification of other tissues and
sometimes kidney stones.

177
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,100
The fluid shifts that occur in space can
lead to orthostatic intolerance, or

178
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,110
an inability to maintain blood pressure
when you get back to Earth.

179
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,780
The body has forgotten how to keep the
blood up against gravity,

180
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,339
that can result in fainting, if an
astronaut stands for ten minutes or more.

181
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,950
This problem is exacerbated by a loss of
total fluid in space of about 20%,

182
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,140
because there's no need to maintain blood
pressure to

183
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,030
the same degree without any gravity to
overcome.

184
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,970
The orthostatic intolerance can last for
weeks upon returning to Earth.

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,630
And finally, a big concern about prolonged
space travel and

186
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,670
exposure is increased radiation.

187
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,740
Without the protective field of the
Earth's atmosphere,

188
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,880
astronauts in space station are exposed to
radiation from cosmic rays at

189
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,950
a magnitude of ten times that of Earth.

190
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,590
Unfortunately, high dose radiation damages
bone marrow, lymphocytes, and other immune

191
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,140
markers, resulting in suppressed immunity
and increased susceptibility to viruses.

192
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,160
This can cause a spread of infection
within normally healthy populations in

193
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,249
the confined living quarters in space.

194
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,260
Increased radiation has also been linked
to higher incidences of

195
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,610
cataracts in astronauts.

196
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,410
It also may put astronauts at greater risk
of diseases like cancer,

197
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,460
since we know radiation can cause
chromosomal mutations.

198
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,840
Also, rare strong solar flare events,
which are unpredictable, could

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,420
give a one time massive dose of radiation
to astronauts that could be fatal.

200
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,470
The issues associated with muscle and bone
loss have gotten better over the years.

201
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,560
Everyone is now well aware of the problem,
and

202
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,360
it can be at least partially prevented
with regular exercise while in space.

203
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,570
Astronauts are required to exercise at
least two hours a day to prevent bone and

204
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,370
muscle wasting.

205
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,300
But special exercise equipment is
required.

206
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,320
If you think about it, you can't just run
normally on a treadmill in space.

207
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,410
One stride forward, and you'd be floating
around the room.

208
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,580
So as you can see in the picture to my
left,

209
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,700
astronauts are secured down with bungee
cords, so there's some resistance to

210
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,749
their running that both loads the skeleton
and holds them onto the treadmill.

211
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,950
But, who's to say you have to run on the
floor in space?

212
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,520
Or, for that matter, which is the floor
when you're in space?

213
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
It's all the same.

214
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,490
Astronauts on the space station also have
access to important resistance

215
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,250
training equipment.

216
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
Even exercising two hours a day isn't
enough to keep the astronauts from

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,340
losing bone.

218
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,200
So engineers are in the process of
experimenting with new compression suits,

219
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
pictured to my right.

220
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,102
They're designed with built in elastic
strap that go from the shoulders down to

221
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,420
the ankles.

222
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,850
The hope is that the constant loading of
the spine and

223
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,069
legs will keep some of the bone and muscle
wasting from taking place.

224
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,520
And as far as I can tell from the picture,

225
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,960
the suit has the added benefit of making
the astronauts look like superheroes.

226
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,220
Put on the suit, add a cape, go to outer
space.

227
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,300
You're good to go, Wonder Woman.

228
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,560
And finally, some of the discomfort,
nausea and insomnia can be treated

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,089
by various medications, such as pain meds,
anti-nausea patches, and sleeping pills.

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,160
As we get closer to the possibility of a
man trip to Mars and

231
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,200
doing more distance space exploration,
research into the risks,

232
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,120
health consequences, and counter measure
becomes more critical.

233
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
The trips of longer duration would magnify
many of

234
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,689
the risks described in this module.

235
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,900
Despite all the risks and possible
disasters I listed in this module,

236
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,010
many people would still jump at the
opportunity to go into space.

237
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,890
There's a majesty and a mystery about
space.

238
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,380
A feeling of something bigger than
ourselves that unite us for our faith and

239
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,570
our spirituality.

240
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,269
And the feeling that we're all connected
to each other and to the cosmos around us.

241
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,880
You get that sense of awe when you listen
to astronauts talk about their time and

242
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,600
experience in space.

243
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,460
I've included some of those links in the
resources section for you.

244
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,710
But you don't have to go to space to
experience that sense of awe.

245
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,410
I get it, when I look at your bodies, and
all your different shapes and

246
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,025
sizes, colors and ages.

247
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,670
We're all connected in the amazing
capacity of our

248
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,670
bodies to deal with the stresses that the
world can throw at us.

249
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,010
We've talked in this class about cold,
heat, altitude, stress, age, and

250
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,620
even outer space.

251
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,550
And through it all, we've seen how our
bodies not only adapt to survive but

252
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,640
to make us better and stronger.

253
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,755
Or as Corey likes to say, version 2.0 of
ourselves.

254
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,580
We've thrown a lot of information at you
in this class, and I hope you

255
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,230
will be able to use some of it to make
better and healthier choices in your life.

256
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,290
But even if you forget many of the details
over time, I hope a sense of

257
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,120
appreciation and respect for your body
will remain with you throughout your life.

258
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,470
Your body does so many things for you
every moment of every day.

259
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,030
Make sure you give it a few things back.

260
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,140
Physical activity, good nutrition, rest,
laughter and

261
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,450
gratitude, and of course, a little
environmental or

262
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,470
physical challenge here and there, just to
keep it interesting.

263
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,040
Thank you all for making this online
experience one that we'll never forget.

264
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
And I mean that in a good way.

265
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,980
We'll have one more weekly check-in posted
next week to say farewell.

266
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,820
But for now, bye.
