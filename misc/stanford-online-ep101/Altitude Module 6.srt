1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,990
Welcome to Module 6.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,182
All about Corey, his questions, his bodily
functions and his data.

3
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:09,010
We're going to apply some of what we
learned in

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,350
general about acclimatization to Corey's
experience on the peak.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,230
First, just a reminder of the questions we
left you with at the end of

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,530
the Pike's Peak story video.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,530
Why did Corey sleep so badly on the first
night?

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,310
Why did Corey's submaximal performance
improve?

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,640
Why didn't his maximum performance
improve?

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,810
Sleeping, peeing, and farting, oh my!

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,460
Let's start with sleep.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,000
There are several things that can
interfere with sleep at altitude.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,120
First, symptoms of acute mountain sickness
like headache,

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,340
frequently are present in the early days
at altitude.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,970
Both Corey and I had a splitting headache
that first day.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,670
Second, people experience periodic
breathing at attitude,

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,340
referred to as Cheyne Stokes breathing.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,350
This condition happens quite frequently,
but

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,270
it is not associated with altitude illness
per se.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,130
Results from a conflict within the body
over a control of breathing during sleep.

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,270
We talked about this before, oxygen
sensors in the body tell the brain to

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,590
increase ventilation which causes the
lungs to blow off CO2.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,920
But CO2 sensors in the body then tell the
brain to slow breathing,

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,510
as a result, breathing then stops for

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,120
up to 10 to 12 seconds, until the oxygen
sensors take over again.

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,430
The first large breath after the pause
will sometimes wake the person up with

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,570
a feeling of breathlessness or
suffocation.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,460
Also generally when you sleep, your
metabolic rate declines which

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,579
further slows breathing and can exacerbate
low oxygen levels in the blood.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,040
Third, you may recall from the video that
Corey got up four times to

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,080
pee in the night.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,920
It's hard to sleep when you have to pee.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,700
So why the frequent urination?

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,230
Well, reason one is hydrate, hydrate,
hydrate.

35
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,530
That is the advice that people are given
when they go to altitude.

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,320
The dryer air, increased ventilation, and

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,630
high energy outputs with rapid evaporation
of sweat accelerate fluid losses.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,450
To prevent dehydration it is wise to up
your fluid intake.

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,730
Reason 2, is it's actually part of the
acclimatization process.

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,580
Can you think back to module 5 and
remember what I might be talking about.

41
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,750
Loss of plasma volume.

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,030
In an attempt to hemo concentrate the
blood,

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,270
people excrete excess plasma volume in the
form of urine.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,890
Throw the excreted bi-carbon there and you
get lots of frothy urine.

45
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,580
Believe me I know this because we did
urine collections in

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,240
one of our experiments on the peak and we
all rotated processing those collections.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,470
Not my favorite part of the experience,
but all for the good of science aye.

48
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,100
If we're just going to get rid of our
plasma volume anyway why are we advised to

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,279
hydrate at altitude.

50
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,900
It has to do with where the water is
coming from.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,030
If you lose too much fluid before your
body sends the proper hormonal signals to

52
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,640
reduce your plasma volume, the water will
be drawn from other cells and

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,560
compartments like your brain.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,080
Basically, you want your body to make the
change at it's own pace and

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,709
not force it into a dehydrated state.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,620
Okay.

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,090
You've all experienced it.

58
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,150
Flatus expulsion.

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,290
Corey in the video team started to notice
it on the way up the mountain on

60
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,830
the first day.

61
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,990
During my Pike's Peak research tenure, I
remember some pretty fragrant mornings,

62
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,570
walking to the participant dorm room with
10, not so clean, gaseous young men.

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,150
As I mentioned in one of the first slides
it is a simple matter of physics.

64
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,830
As the pressure of altitude decreases the
volume of

65
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,980
the gas in your gut increases and wants
out.

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,150
In addition you are frequently eating an
unfamiliar diet when you

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,140
are trekking in the mountains, like lots
of nuts and dried fruit.

68
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,600
So that can make the problem worse.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,050
Let's move onto the serious questions,
shall we?

70
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,920
Why did Corey's Submax performance improve
by day three?

71
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,600
To my right is a table of Corey's data
during the treadmill test at sea level

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,980
within the first two hours of arrival on
the peak and then 48 hours later.

73
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,850
The data posted is from stage five which
is the same absolute work load in

74
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,290
each case.

75
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,650
Therefore, as row one indicates, Corey
required essentially the same amount of

76
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,100
oxygen to do the same amount of work under
each of the three conditions.

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,860
Rather than walk you through each of the
numbers, just pause the video and

78
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,190
take a moment to look through the pattern
of the numbers with the following

79
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,079
thoughts in mind.

80
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,990
Do the numbers continue to change over
time, or

81
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,930
do some revert back closer to sea level?

82
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,850
Is the pattern what you would expect given
the adaptations we have discussed so

83
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,920
far in this section?

84
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,060
Figure it all out?

85
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,560
Good.

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,030
Now, what are the adaptations that cause
these numbers to behave the way they do?

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,280
I can read it right off the slide.

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,240
Increased hematocrit and increased
ventilation means more oxygen per

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,030
unit blood, resulting in a higher oxygen
saturation on day three.

90
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,140
Therefore, epinephrin and heart rate can
be lower for a given work load.

91
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,840
Overall the work load felt less stressful
for Corey, was easier to accomplish, and

92
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,260
it was closer to his steady state.

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,880
So now the tricky question,

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,230
why didn't Corey's maximum performance
improve on day three relative to day one?

95
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,670
This question is about maximum
performance.

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,750
So, you will note in the table that he
went three stages farther at

97
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,920
sea level than at altitude.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,735
His VO2 max was also much higher at sea
level and you may remember it

99
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:51,740
is also much higher than his maximum value
on the bicycle 65 versus 50.

100
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,210
Except for trained cyclists, a person's
VO2 max is

101
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,155
usually about 15% higher on a treadmill
test than on a bicycle test.

102
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:03,180
Non-cyclists experience localized leg
fatigue before they

103
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,440
maxed out their cardiovascular systems on
the bike.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,820
Also, running uses more muscle mass to
consume the oxygen and

105
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,980
represents a more familiar movement to
most people.

106
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,260
In Corey's case, the difference is even
greater because our buddy Corey is

107
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,329
clearly a track athlete, not a cyclist.

108
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,490
Anyway, again pause the video as long as
you like and investigate the data.

109
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,020
Are the numbers what you would expect?

110
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,240
Do they give you any clues to the ans, to
answer the question?

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Take a look.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,950
Did you find any clues?

113
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,337
Let me put up the thick equation as a
reminder.

114
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:42,950
Some things are definitely getting better,
like the arterial oxygen saturation and

115
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,680
ventilation, but max heart rate is going
down.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,778
That is going to negatively impact the VO2
max.

117
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:55,930
Interestingly, VO2 max does not usually
improve substantially at altitude.

118
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,540
Is because you get helpful adaptations
like increased hermatocrit,

119
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,290
red blood cells and saturation.

120
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,880
But on the other side of the equation
there are negative factors in terms of

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
maximum performance such as decreased
plasma volume, stroke volume, and

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,300
maxed heart rate.

123
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,010
Also the increased viscosity of the blood
and

124
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,520
increased blood pressure combine to
elevate after load.

125
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,020
Afterload is the pressure that the heart
has to fight against when emptying.

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,250
A higher afterload can impair cardiac
output further.

127
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,500
The fall and max heart rate may be a way
for

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,530
us to protect ourselves against the
potential risk of damaging tissue

129
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,320
hypoxia as a result of doing too much high
intensity work at altitude.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,830
Well, that was fun!

131
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,630
But I'm sorry to say it is not all fun and
games at altitude.

132
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,750
Take the practice quiz and I will see you
in the next module.

133
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,250
Thank you.
