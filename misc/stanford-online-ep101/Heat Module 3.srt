1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,240
Unlike cold, heat can severely compromise
exercise performance.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,060
The difference is that in the cold,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,558
the active exercising is counteracting the
cold stress by generating heat.

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,320
In contrast, exercise in the heat is
adding to the problem by adding to

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,650
the heat stress.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,110
However, not all types of exercise are
impacted equally, or

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,690
even at all, for that matter.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,380
Let's take a look.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,560
First, what is the relationship between
exercise intensity and cold temperature?

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,660
When you exercise, metabolic heat
production rises.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,000
Some of that rise will be counteracted by
the convective losses as you

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,650
move through the water air drain activity.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,120
But for a given person with a given
ability to dissipate heat,

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,930
their core temperature will rise in
proportion to the ambient conditions and

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,040
the exercise intensity.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
To my right is a graph of core temperature
in the same person,

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,030
under the same environmental conditions,
at four different constant workloads.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,750
You can see in the lower intensity bouts
core temperature doesn't rise as much and

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,430
eventually stabilizes at a higher set
point.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,080
In contrast the higher work intensities
elevate core temperature more and

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,550
never quite reach steady state.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,040
Those higher intensity bouts will

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,740
eventually lead to temperature induced
fatigue.

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,450
So how does elevated core temperature
impact exercise performance?

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,400
Well, it depends on what type of
performance you're considering.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,430
If you're just talking about muscle
temperature and

27
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,310
performance, then increasing temperature
is actually good.

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,710
Do you remember our discussion about Q10
effects in the cold section?

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,620
For every ten degrees centigrade that your
muscle temperature goes up,

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,660
the enzyme reactions double in speed.

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,130
Therefore, as your muscles warm up, they
work faster.

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,820
That is one reason why it is important to
warm up before competition on cold days.

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,610
A classic example comes from a study of
more than 70 years ago,

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,290
by Asmusen and all.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,600
Who demonstrated that single spreet,
single sprint speed improved by 5% for

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,960
every one degree increase in muscle
temperature following either passive or

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,810
active warm up.

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,620
On the other hand, a core temperature rise
above

39
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,120
38 degrees centigrade begins to impair
performance in a variety of activities.

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,024
These include prolonged exercise between
40 and 80% of maximum for

41
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,210
about an hour or longer.

42
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,550
Maximal, or near maximal, activity of
greater than three minutes.

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,269
Maximal isometric contraction, and repeat
sprint bouts.

44
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,390
Let's investigate why a rise in core
temperature impacts all of

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,820
those latter types of exercise.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,680
First, let's look at VO2 max, your maximal
aerobic capacity,

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,990
which is the gold standard for measuring
your cardiovascular fitness.

48
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,140
As core temperature goes up, your body
will try to get rid of

49
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,720
that excess heat by shunting blood to the
periphery in the skin.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
The dilation of those additional vessels,

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,680
will increase the total volume of the
system causing blood pressure to fall and

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,020
oxygen transport to the muscles to
decline.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,050
Blood pressure and

54
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,430
cardiac output will try to compensate, but
won't be able to do it for long.

55
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,620
Think of it as adding an addition hose to
your faucet without increasing the amount

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,840
of water coming from the faucet.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,580
Now the same water will have to go through
two hoses, so the pressure and

58
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,660
the amount of water in each hose will
fall.

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,830
The increase in system volume, the fallen
blood pressure, and

60
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,850
the decreased heart filling time because
of the increased heart rate,

61
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,660
will all combine to lower the amount of
blood coming back to the heart and

62
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,818
filling the chambers, which is known as
preload.

63
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,382
With less preload,

64
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:55,180
stroke volume declines, cardiac output
declines and VO2 max declines.

65
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,630
The compromised blood flow to the muscles
can also cause peripheral fatigue that

66
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,800
will impact VO2max, but we'll get to that
in a couple of slides.

67
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,080
As we saw in the previous slide, as core
temperature rises, blood is

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,760
shunted to the periphery, causing stroke
volume and muscle blood flow to fall.

69
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,500
This happens during submaximal prolonged
exercise as well.

70
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,980
In addition, the sweating that is surely
happening in the heat will start to

71
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,430
compromise plasma volume.

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,290
The fall in plasma volume will further
reduce cardiovascular capacity.

73
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,110
Heart rate will try to compensate for

74
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,930
the fall in stroke volume to keep cardiac
output stable.

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,230
Over the course of an exercise bout, heart
rate will drift up more and

76
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,114
more as you relax vessels to the periphery
and continue sweating out plasma volume.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,760
This gradual increase in heart rate is
called cardiovascular drift and

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,159
is now illustrated on the figure to my
right.

79
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,270
Athletes who use heart rate as an estimate
of exercise intensity need to

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,510
be aware that thresholds should be
adjusted in hot conditions to

81
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,310
accommodate cardiovascular drift.

82
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,790
A workload in the heat can feel more
stressful,

83
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,850
even if it is a lower absolute workload.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,370
At higher workloads in the heat, the risk
of thermal injury increases.

85
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,190
In order to keep blood pressure from
falling too much and

86
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,790
thus not getting adequate blood flow to
the brain, your body may

87
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,720
override the local temperature signals and
prevent excessive vasodilation.

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,710
That keeps your blood pressure up, which
is a, this good in the short term, but

89
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,730
it increases the potential for dangerous
heat accumulation.

90
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,430
It's a cardiovascular triage of sorts,

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,240
prioritizing what seems most important at
the moment for your brain and body.

92
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,640
So far in this section we have focused on
the cardiovascular challenges of

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,310
exercise in the heat.

94
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,550
However there are other elements of

95
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,870
performance that need to be considered as
well.

96
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,210
Namely, peripheral and central fatigue.

97
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,960
Peripheral fatigue means that it is your
muscles that are causing you to

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,740
get tired and slow down.

99
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,800
Central fatigue means that it is your
brain telling you to slow down,

100
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,950
maybe as a protective mechanism to spare
your tissues any damage.

101
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,040
Fatigue is complex and thus there are
likely many sources of fatigue that

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,610
rise and fall in importance depending on
the individual, the type of exercise and

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,820
the environmental conditions.

104
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,760
What follows is a description of a few of
the main players, but

105
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,260
it is not an exhaustive list.

106
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,800
Muscle fatigue likely plays a role when
you're at,

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
working at your hardest in the heat.

108
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,200
At maximal effort blood flow, oxygen
delivery and

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,400
waste removal is compromised in your
working muscles.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,770
Therefore, a greater shift to
non-oxidative metabolism, so

111
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,340
energy is produced without using oxygen,
causes you to use up your short term

112
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,390
energy stores and increase the build up of
waste products in your tissues and blood.

113
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,770
As a result, your muscles don't work as
well and performance suffers.

114
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,700
This happens during normal temperature
exercise to, but

115
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,790
it happens faster, when you're overheated.

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,580
In contrast, during moderate intensity
endurance exercise in the heat,

117
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,540
your muscles can compensate for the
decreased blood flow by

118
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,910
increasing the amount of oxygen that you
take out of your blood so

119
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,280
muscle, fatigue seems to be less limiting
during prolonged submaximal exercise.

120
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,010
So then, what does cause fatigue during
more prolonged exercise in the heat?

121
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,560
Well, this is where central fatigue seems
to have an important role.

122
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,700
As body and brain temperature go up,
voluntary muscle activation declines.

123
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,820
40 degrees centigrade is frequently cited
as the critical core temperature, but

124
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,610
it varies, depending on the individual
drive, training status, exercise mode, and

125
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,070
importance of the competition.

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,160
In addition, skin temperature seems to be
a critical player in the fatigue equation.

127
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,720
If your skin temperature is high, as was
the case in most of those earlier critical

128
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,600
core temperature experiments, then your
performance will be impaired and

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,050
fatigue will occur around 40 degrees
centigrade.

130
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,090
If, on the other hand,

131
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,110
your skin temperature is lower, and core
temperatures can

132
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,250
rise above 40 degrees without a
significant drop off in performance.

133
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,530
Researchers in the Thermal and Mountain
Medicine division of

134
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,570
the US Army Research Institute for
Environmental Medicine.

135
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,585
Phew, that's a mouthful.

136
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,950
[LAUGH] Hypothesized that skin temperature
is actually more important to

137
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,360
performance than core temperature.

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,970
Hot skein, skin means more blood needs to
be sent to the skin.

139
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,500
So less blood is available to deliver
oxygen to the muscles,

140
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,530
less blood is available to come back to
the heart, and VO2max decreases.

141
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,010
The fall in VO2max also means that all of
your submaximal workloads would

142
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,780
feel much harder, because they become a
higher percentage of maximum.

143
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,890
Thus, fatigue would occur more rapidly
during submaximal workloads, as well.

144
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,740
Central, peripheral, maximal, submaximal.

145
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,260
How can you really distinguish between
central and peripheral fatigue, anyway?

146
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,210
To help us answer this,

147
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,409
I've put up data from a classic study by
Lars Nybo in the graph to my right.

148
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:17,220
Two minute maximal voluntary contractions
are measured over time in the same

149
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,010
volunteers when they're core temperatures
were hot, hypothermic and normal, control.

150
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,870
The upper line with the triangles
represents the control group.

151
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,779
The lower line with the squares is the
hypothermic group.

152
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,630
The volunteers were trying as hard as they
could in both conditions.

153
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,390
But you can see that less force was
produced over time when they

154
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,060
were hyperthermic, the lower line.

155
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,810
What is really cool, or hot, about the
study,

156
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,660
is that the investigators overlaid
electrical stimulation at certain points.

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,520
Those points are represented by the little
vertical lines and

158
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,280
open symbols above the top line.

159
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,830
So when the muscles were stimulated to
contract from an outside source,

160
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,110
the muscles produced the same maximal
force with and without hyperthermia.

161
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,450
This indicates that muscles themselves
were not impaired, but

162
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,360
the volunteers weren't able to recruit
them fully when hyperthermic.

163
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,650
That clearly points to central fatigue is
the key factor,

164
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,948
at least under those laboratory
conditions.

165
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,560
Ain't science grand?

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,170
the skin temperature studies mentioned
above, are included in the resources for

168
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,130
this section in case you want to read a
little bit more on the topic.

169
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,570
Given all this information,

170
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,440
when should different types of athletes
prefer to compete?

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,640
Well let's look at what we know.

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,980
Sprint performance improves with warmer
muscle temperature.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,290
Endurance performance is compromised with
high core temperature.

174
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,450
We are colder in the morning than the
afternoon,

175
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,010
due to natural circadian rhythms.

176
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,410
And ambient temperatures are usually
cooler in the morning, than the afternoon.

177
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,210
What do you think this all means for

178
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,390
when sprinters, versus endurance athletes,
like to compete?

179
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,690
And what's the impact on athletes
competing in sprint events where

180
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,750
they have multiple heats, throughout the
day?

181
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,080
It's not rocket science, right?

182
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,320
Just think about it for a little while.

183
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Sorry if that was a complicated module.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,110
When it comes to humans, exercise
performance and

185
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,740
fatigue, there's usually no easy answer.

186
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,040
Fatigue and athletic performance are
impacted by multiple factors

187
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,179
simultaneously, especially when you have a
systemic challenge like hyperthermia.

188
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,800
The good news is that we now get to move
on to a more concrete module of what

189
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,210
happened to Corey in the hot room.

190
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,180
Answer the Check for Understanding
questions, and I'll see you soon.

191
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,680
Thanks.
