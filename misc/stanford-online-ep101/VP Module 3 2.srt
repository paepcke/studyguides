1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,320
Free diving is a technique used with many
types of activities.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,060
Basically, it means going under water
without the assistance of

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,060
any breathing devices.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,960
Until the past century, it was the only
way to explore or

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,670
to retrieve items from under water.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,030
Retrieving natural sponges, among other
treasured sea life,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,590
was big business as far back as at least
Plato.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,800
Currently, people free dive for recreation
and competition.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,310
For recreation, proponents say it has
advantages over scuba that include

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:36,570
requiring less gear, no distracting sounds
or bubbles, cheaper, less prep time,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,343
greater mobility under water, and less
risk of decompression sickness.

12
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:46,170
Free diving competition is complicated
with many categories ranging from static

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,650
apnea in the pool, basically how long you
can hold your breath without moving,

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,040
to extreme depth diving with and without
weights, with and without fins, et cetera.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,420
The current depth record recognized by the
AIDA regulatory board in

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,650
the no limits category is 214 meters.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,110
That's 702 feet.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,350
Like with scuba, free divers experience
dramatic pressure changes as

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,990
they dive down to depths equivalent or
even lower than scuba divers.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,600
Similarly, during the dive the
non-compressible spaces like the nose,

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,660
trachea, sinuses, ears, and even the mask,
need to be equilibrated.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,960
However, the major difference is that with
scuba there is

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,710
air coming in from the tank to fill those
spaces as the gas gets compressed down.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,290
In free diving there's no additional air
coming in except for

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,364
what is available in the compressible
spaces like the lungs.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,000
As the diver goes down farther and
farther, the lungs compress both due

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,570
to the pressure and to give up additional
air to those other stiff spaces.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,570
At great depths the lung can compress
below residual volume, which is the size

29
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,070
they'd be right now if you blew out all
the air you could possibly blow out.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,410
As you can imagine,

31
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,860
it takes awhile to get used to the feeling
of extreme compression.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,410
So how do people hold their breaths long
enough to descend 702 feet and

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,700
then make it back up again?

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,310
Well, training, which we'll see in the
next slide, but

35
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,489
they also get a little help from Mother
Nature.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,740
If you're not going to keep breathing
you'd better A,

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,450
use as little oxygen as possible for
non-vital functions.

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,670
And B, provide your important tissues like
brain and

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,880
heart with as much oxygen as possible.

40
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,520
The diving reflex is very prominent in
water man, mammals like seals and

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,550
otters, but it exists to a lesser degree
in other mammals including humans.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,800
When we put our face in cold water our
heart rate can drop 10 to 25%.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,820
That's lowering our metabolic rate.

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,770
We are innately prepping ourselves for

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,710
a possible period when oxygen may be
limited.

46
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,220
How neat is that?

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,980
The cooler the water, the stronger the
response.

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,790
However, if our core gets too cold and we
start shivering, that negates the effect.

49
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,770
Unless of course we go so, we get so

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,160
cold that we actually go into a state of
suspended animation,

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,469
like kids falling into a frozen lake that
we talked about in the cold lectures.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,490
Anyway, as part of a diving reflex we also
get peripheral vasoconstriction,

53
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,280
which directs more blood to the critical
tissues like the brain and the heart.

54
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,500
As the diver goes deeper and pressure
increases two other things happen.

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,050
First, the spleen, which serves as a
reservoir for

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,150
extra blood, contracts to release those
extra oxygen carrying red blood cells into

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,810
the circulation and to increase the sheer
volume of blood in the system.

58
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,780
Second, a very interesting thing called
blood shift happens to

59
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,420
prevent the increase in pressure from
crushing the chest cavity.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,370
As a diver goes down his lungs get
compressed in

61
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,680
proportion to the pressure change.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,330
At 50 meters the lungs are about one sixth
their normal volume.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,620
It was thought by physiologists that free
divers would not be able to

64
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,990
go below 50 meters without crushing their
lungs and ribcages.

65
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,110
However, they were proved wrong in 1961
when it was accomplished by

66
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,910
free diver Enzo Majorca.

67
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,490
Researchers later discovered that the
blood shunted from a diver's extremities

68
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,400
by vasoconstriction, and from the spleen
finds a new home in the chest cavity,

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,780
occupying the space created when air in
the lungs is compressed.

70
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,070
The blood plasma fills the alveoli,

71
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,030
which are the small air sacs in the
diver's lungs where gas exchange occurs.

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,870
Plasma is essentially an incompressible
fluid.

73
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,920
So it helps prevent critical damaging
compression as the divers descends.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Wow.

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,548
Our bodies are freaking amazing.

76
00:04:55,548 --> 00:05:00,180
Now the blood-plasma shift is not without
risks.

77
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,140
Although most is reabsorbed when the diver
leaves the high-pressure environment,

78
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,600
fluid and blood leakage into lungs can
occur.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
But still, as a temporary emergency fix,
it's pretty sweet.

80
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,140
By the way, another less serious side
effect of the vasoconstriction and

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,300
spleen contraction is more central blood
volume, which increases blood pressure.

82
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,120
Your kidneys adjust to that by clearing
fluid.

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,320
So just like when people are in the cold
and have to pee more, so

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,190
too do divers say they haven't have an
urge to pee underwater.

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,640
In the longer term, it can also lead to
dehydration.

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,570
Free divers train to increase their breath
holding ability in several ways.

87
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,070
They work on reducing their metabolic rate
through relaxation techniques

88
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,750
like meditation.

89
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,610
Lowering metabolic rate decreases oxygen
requirements during the dive.

90
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,850
Second, divers practice building their
tolerance to CO2 in the blood.

91
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,130
The drive to breath is far more strongly
regulated by the build up of CO2 than

92
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,840
the lack of O2 in most people.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,170
Therefore, if you can tolerate more CO2
buildup, you can hold your breath longer.

94
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,570
Training involves a rather uncomfortable
process where you try to

95
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,270
override that incredible urge to breath at
the end of holding your breath.

96
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,640
This works because even when you're forced
to take a breath by the CO2,

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,920
you still have a fair amount of oxygen
left in your lungs.

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,820
However, ignoring that primal survival
instinct to

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,850
breathe is both challenging and can be
dangerous.

100
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,290
Third, a person's lung capacity is
generally considered pretty stable and

101
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,620
highly correlated with chest size.

102
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,950
However, there are some things that divers
can do to expand the capacity of

103
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,310
their lungs.

104
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,513
Mainly involves working on the compliance
of the rib cage by

105
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:54,280
loosening connective tissue and packing
more air into the lungs.

106
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,360
The fourth box to my right is pre-dive.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,495
Before dives experienced divers will pack
their lungs with more air called,

108
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:10,678
not surprisingly, lung packing, or less
obviously, glossopharyngeal insufflation.

109
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:15,770
Basically it involves inhaling a full
breath, then expanding the ridge cage,

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,178
rib cage, raising the shoulder blades,
tipping the head back, and

111
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:25,000
then forcing more into, air into the lungs
using a kind of gulping motion.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,480
By the way, I'm not recommending that you
try it because it can cause lung damage if

113
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,440
you don't know what you are doing.

114
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,410
Anyway, experienced divers can increase
the volume of the air in

115
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,900
their lungs significantly by using this
technique.

116
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,960
And finally, we come to hyperventilation,
or forcing air deeply or

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,570
rapidly in and out of your lungs.

118
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,300
This is something we tend to do
instinctively when we are going to hold

119
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,590
our breath in the pool, for example.

120
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,250
It does help us hold our breath longer but
not for the reason you might think.

121
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,530
Contrary to what many believe it doesn't
increase the oxygen in

122
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,470
our systems significantly, but it does
decrease the CO2 in our blood.

123
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,820
Remember how I said earlier that our urge
to breathe is governed more by

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,590
high CO2 than low O2?

125
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,500
Well that applies here as well.

126
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,550
The problem is that if you blow off your
CO2 you can black out

127
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,580
underwater from lack of O2 before the CO2
response causes you to breath, so

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,880
it can be dangerous for divers to
hyperventilate.

129
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:30,670
Therefore, experienced divers may take a
couple of deep breaths before diving but

130
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,740
many will do no hyperventilation at all.

131
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,690
If you're interested in testing the
control of ventilation on yourself,

132
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,010
I've included a mini experiment for you to
try at the end of this section.

133
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,250
It's fun, requires only a brown bag, and
can be completed in a few minutes.

134
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Try it.

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,590
It's a good illustration of physiology.

136
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,329
Fun with science.

137
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,650
Ready, last slide for diving.

138
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,670
Risk and safety for free diving.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,920
One of the biggest risks is blackout.

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,190
In extreme diving and

141
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,810
competition, divers are trying to push the
limits of tolerance underwater.

142
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,080
If they misjudge and don't make it back to
the surface before their oxygen runs out,

143
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,430
they can black out underwater.

144
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,700
Usually this happens near the surface
because they haven't quite made it

145
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,380
all the way back up.

146
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,450
It's much more rare for

147
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,290
it to happen in deep water unless
something goes terribly wrong.

148
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,050
Because of the blackout risk,

149
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,590
free divers never go down without a safety
diver watching them continuously.

150
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,410
If the first diver passes out, the safety
diver will cover their mouth and

151
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,090
nose to prevent inhalation and

152
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,720
pull the diver to the surface; where they
will automatically start breathing again.

153
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,880
Second on the list is respiratory squeeze.

154
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,357
When tissues are squeezed in response to
the increasing pressure,

155
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,126
whether they're compressible or

156
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:56,126
non-compressible, they can get damaged and
start to leak fluid and blood.

157
00:09:56,126 --> 00:10:01,555
Trachea, lungs, sinuses, nose, even the
space covered by the mask,

158
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:04,543
can all suffer barotrauma and damage.

159
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:08,063
Although getting squeezed rarely results
in permanent damage,

160
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:11,967
lung squeeze was thought to have
contributed to the recent free diving,

161
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:15,108
diving death of Nicholas Mevoli in
November 2013.

162
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,740
The good news is that free diving doesn't
have the same risks as sc,

163
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,240
scuba in terms of gas toxicity and
decompression issues.

164
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,740
The short duration underwater and minimal
available oxygen reduce these risks.

165
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,160
It takes significant training in order to
free dive long enough and

166
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,249
deep enough to get decompression sickness.

167
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,990
However, nitrogen can accumulate over time
in the blood during many repeat dives,

168
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,330
so appropriate precaution should still be
taken in that situation.

169
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,460
That's it for the physiology of high
pressure environments.

170
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,340
Next up, microgravity.

171
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,890
In some ways, you can't get more different
than talking about being

172
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:04,130
way underwater with high pressure to way
outerspace with minimal pressure.

173
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,680
On the other hand, the buoyancy that we
feel drifting underwater may be as

174
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,500
close as most of us can get on Earth to
feeling what its like to float in space.

175
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,660
The physiology however is very different.

176
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,700
So, watch module five to learn what
happens in our bodies in that wild and

177
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,560
crazy environment.

178
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:26,810
First though, get a feeling for what it's
actually be in space by listening to

179
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,880
the excellent Radiolab podcast story that
we linked in module four for

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,670
your listening pleasure.

181
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,730
Again, feel free to download the podcast
to your phone and

182
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,670
listen while you're taking a walk.

183
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,830
Enjoy, see you soon.
