00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,470
As you are taking this class, one thing to
remember is that sometimes students may

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,480
feel unmotivated or discouraged during an
online course.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,160
This might be due to a feeling that you
are anonymous and

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,850
not really connected to a group.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,990
We know that participants of this course
come from every ethnic, religious, and

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,580
educational background possible.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,180
We want you to know, that no matter which
of these groups you belong to,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,240
you're now part of a single course
community.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,920
Our community.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,780
Even though it's simple, you might find
your learning is helped if you

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,520
notice whether you're feeling like an
outsider or like a member of the class.

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,770
One way you can practice feeling more like
a member is to actively participate.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,720
By watching the videos and answering the
online questions you will be sharing

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,180
a learning experience with thousands of
other people from around the world.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,460
The best way to connect with other
participants is to share your thoughts and

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,820
comments online through the discussion
forums.

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,380
Having a shared experience with social
interaction can become the glue that

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,150
allows people to learn together.

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,520
We believe that you belong in our
community.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,250
And we couldn't be more excited to have
you here.
