1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,265
>> [SOUND] Is my helmet on straight?

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:07,950
>> [LAUGH]
It is.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,350
And I especially like the two tufts of

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,105
hair that are sticking out the different
holes.

5
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:12,100
>> [CROSSTALK] Alfalfa style?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,680
>> Looks good.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,290
Little horns.

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,310
>> Well that's embarrassing.

9
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,250
Anyway, transitioning from the physiology
of stress due

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,230
to the physiology of altitude.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,040
>> Were you surprised last week, with Cory
giving the lectures?

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,010
Wasn't he great?

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,500
Did such an amazing job.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,940
So proud of him.

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,040
And, you know, I hope it left you with
some tools that you can use in that arena.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,100
He was so good at delivering the stress
unit.

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,770
because he's so calming and soothing.

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,900
>> You know, well, what a great
opportunity for me, and

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,210
I really hope that it was a positive
experience for you.

20
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,160
It's something that, you know, I won't
forget any time soon and

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,270
that's really helped me grow take my next
step, and to become a better teacher.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,619
So, thank you all for giving me that
opportunity.

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,595
>> And so this week we move back to
altitude, and

24
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,670
[SOUND] I'll be giving the lectures again.

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,560
And altitude is one of my favorite topics.

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,690
I love being in the mountains, and I've
done research at altitude.

27
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,330
I know a lot of you out there are climbers
and you're excited for this unit.

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,230
So, we're going to be talking about all
sort of great things.

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,750
We have a couple different stories, videos
for you, both in a chamber and

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,160
up on the mountains and, we're going to be
talking about farting, and peeing,

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,430
and insomnia.

32
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,865
>> It's not all going to be pretty.

33
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:21,670
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's for sure.

34
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,950
>> It's all great stuff.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,495
>> Some of them are ugly.

36
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,940
>> [LAUGH] Yeah but it's, it was a great
journey on that one too.

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,420
So hopefully you'll learn a lot from this
unit.

38
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,050
And, come out the other side safer and
better mountaineers.

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,645
>> Yeah, and unfortunately I've become a
guinea pig again.

40
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:40,635
[SOUND] And the physiology of altitude is
no walk in the park.

41
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,170
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,760
So we'll see you on the other side.

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,790
Enjoy.
>> See you soon.
