2
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,737
We have the honor today of being with Joe
Coughlin,

3
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:13,950
who is the director of the age lab.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,030
His research exams have the disruptive
demographics of an aging society, social

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,610
trends and technology will shape future
innovations in business and government.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,970
Coughlin teaches policy and

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,655
systems innovation in MIT"s engineering
systems division.

8
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:31,770
Dr. Coughlin has advised numerous
governments, the world economic forum and

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,410
the council on foreign relations, and

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,420
is a fellow of Swizterland's world
demographics and aging forum.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,500
He was appointed by president George W.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,580
Bush ,to serve on the White House advisory
committee on aging,

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,970
and has testified before Congress.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,310
The National Transportation Safety Board
and

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,880
addressed the National Governors
Association.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,320
His research and collaboration with
industry has earned him recognition as one

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,210
of Fast Company Magazine's a 100 most
creative peoples in business.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,585
A fine line between a bio and eulogy but,
thank you.

19
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:00,710
[LAUGH]
>> So

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,026
you use that term, disruptive demographics
quite frequently.

21
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:05,840
> Mm-hm.
>> Can you tell us what you mean by that?

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,730
>> Well, we all know from the very very
fine work of Clay Christensen and

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,360
others that ,disruptive innovation comes
often from technology.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,110
Technology comes and changes the game.

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,680
Here at the age lab we believe that,
that's not incorrect but it is incomplete.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,950
That the new generation of older adults,

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,970
with greater numbers, greater
expectations, are set to converge with

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,480
that technology to demand not just to live
longer, but to live better.

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,110
>> So ,that idea that struck a demographic
is what caused you to found this.

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,310
because you were here at MIT before and
how long ago did you start the age lab?

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,510
>> Started the lab on paper in about 99,
and then physcial space around 2001.

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,820
But really was to solve what I see as the,
the longevity paradox.

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,100
Life expectancy is about 30 to 40 years
longer than it was 100 years ago.

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,270
But we have yet to invent what we are
going to do.

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,730
>> Mm-hm.
>> To fill that time in.

36
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,220
It's gotta be better than golf, rocking
chairs, and cruise ships.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,880
>> Mm-hm.
>> And so,

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,480
beginning whether it's the car, shopping,
finances, frankly even having fun.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,250
>> Mm-hm.
>> We hope to

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,540
invent how you live tomorrow.

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,340
I, I get to, talk about it but the
students, the staff that I work with,

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,350
and faculty.

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,990
They're the great minds, and, and the fact
is that what we're really trying to do,

44
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,380
is to really cast a new definition around
aging.

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,600
A sense of optimism and living longer is
an opportunity to invent how we live,

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,220
not a problem that governments, families,
and communities should be depressed about.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,040
In fact, one of the real precepts of the
lab ,is that hopefully nothing that we

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,130
develop in here is for old people by
themselves.

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,020
>> Mm-hm.
>> As we've learned from the auto industry

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,450
and almost anything else, if you build an
old man's car, a young man won't buy it,

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,910
or a young woman, but neither will an old
man.

52
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,148
So as we reinvent life tomorrow being
safer, easier, more fun,

53
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,400
20 year old's don't complain about that
either.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,100
So really, the aging population is an
opportunity to reinvent how we all live,

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,540
albeit longer.

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,800
>> So that sort of touches on the breadth
of the age lab, and you collaborate with

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,510
industry, and academics, and students and,
>> Right.

58
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,010
>> So how do those all fit together?

59
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,810
That's a very unique model that you're
working under.

60
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,840
>> Well, we're based in the engineering
systems division, so

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,000
the, the notion here at MIT is that,
integrated thinking across disciplines,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,200
whether it's exercise physiology,
psychology, indeed engineering.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,220
Medical.

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,590
But also if you think about how we age and
how we live.

65
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,090
It's not that any one is wrong and

66
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,395
we're only focusing on one domain, but
it's how we pull those things together.

67
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:24,050
So age lab really wants to replicate the
consumer facing experience of how we

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,960
use technology ,how we navigate every day
and how we spend those 30 to 40 years.

69
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,790
>> And that seems to be really your
target, the consumers.

70
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,580
You don't do basic science research here.

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,700
You really try and apply that to the real
world.

72
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,410
>> As is, the school of engineering where
we hope to develop here as in,

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,930
in Asia lab in particular is new methods,
new insights, new technologies, and

74
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,340
to ignite what is that vision of how we
will live.

75
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,410
>> Uh-huh.

76
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,880
And can you give an example of some of the
projects that you have going on right now?

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,930
>> Sure, we've worked extensively with the
auto industry to rethink the interface of

78
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,150
the car that is getting increasingly
autonomous,

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,780
hence Miss Daisy sitting in the middle of
the room.

80
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,590
And the question here is not how old is an
older driver, but

81
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,860
how does a driver at any age adopt, trust
and eventually use new technology?

82
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,410
What's better?

83
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,160
Shall we use voice commands.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,780
Well, voice commands are interesting but
given that 90% of the population over age

85
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,370
50, particularly men, have a hearing
hearing deficit, is a problem.

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,550
Should it be touch command?

87
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,400
Well, that leads to a lot of other issues
in terms of arthritis and

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,390
physical factors as well as distraction
factors and so one of the innovations that

89
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,040
we've come out with here is that, in fact,
it might have to be a blended answer.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,310
That, in fact, it's not any one interface
But its personalization, and

91
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,040
personalization does a number of things,
one it allows you to make it work for

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,620
your capability, but secondly when its
personalized, its not about age,

93
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,430
its about being cool.

94
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,570
>> Uh-hm.

95
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,530
And we're here specifically to look at the
Agnes suit and

96
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,200
so
>> Right.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,710
>> With that, we've earlier that it,

98
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,710
it provides a certain amount of empathy,
>> Sure.

99
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,700
>> That may also create that opportunity.

100
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,690
>> Yup.
>> Everyone realizes that they are in

101
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,570
fact going to get to a stage where they
going to have this impairments Then I'm

102
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,790
sure that people will jump on and try and
re-create the products that we have.

103
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,290
>> Absolutely.

104
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,650
And AGNES is one of the tools that we
developed because we

105
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,100
realized that the current set of tools do
a very bad job at giving you

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,510
insights into what the future may hold.

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,730
And so AGNES really gives that aha moment
for a design engineer or

108
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,220
a planner, frankly a policy maker, or even
a corporate marketer.

109
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,290
Of what it feels like to have a difficult
time opening a box, reaching for

110
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,090
a shelf, getting in and out of a vehicle.

111
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,040
>> Certainly for middle age or

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,510
younger people, talking about health later
on is not the stimulus that they need.

113
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,680
>> Yeah.
>> It's really Has to,

114
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,670
has to focus on something right now.

115
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,560
>> Tangible, yeah.

116
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,520
>> Like, it's going to give you more
energy right now.

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,030
>> Yeah.
>> It's going to

118
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,460
reduce that pain right now.

119
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,430
This idea that someday, way in the future,
>> Way in the future, yeah.

120
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,970
>> You're going to have osteoporosis, or

121
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,810
you're going to not be able to get off the
toilet, and

122
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,440
that's, actually it doesn't really
motivate us.

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,260
>> Exactly.

124
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,570
Because, you know, by the time you're
about 50, ,if you've made it that far

125
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,220
you're pretty confident that you'll make
it the next ,uh, rest of the marathon so.

126
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,830
>> Haha.
>> So this is AGNES,

127
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,690
age gain now empathy system, and basically
what AGNES is,

128
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,690
is a tool that we developed for students
and for companies we work with to

129
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,610
give that aha moment of what it's like to
do the simple things we take for

130
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,618
granted, getting in and out of the car
Going shopping, opening a bottle or a box.

131
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:22,100
And so ,we've got a variety of things that
my colleagues here in the lab of design to

132
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,440
replicate that tightening of neck that
happens, unfortunately, in our 30s and

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,020
40s if we don't stay as sharp as we once
did.

134
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,120
The ,uh, yellowing of lenses of the eyes
as well as contrast sensitivity.

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,600
For instance You know, most people would
like to think he's aging 15,

136
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,210
20 years older than themselves, but with
respect to vision, you

137
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,520
need 20 times more light to see as well to
drive at night as you did at age 40.

138
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,920
So aging starts a lot sooner than we
think.

139
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,100
But the suit goes through.

140
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,280
We've got various straps and harnesses and
the like to replicate the feeling of

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,720
stiffening joints around arthritis ,but
this is not destiny.

142
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,270
One of the teachable moments we've learned
about AGNES, was that,

143
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,060
while we were using it as a tool to give
the approximation of a 75,

144
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,200
80 year old woman behaving badly with
diabetes and osteoarthritis.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,120
This is also a teachable moment that with
behaving well,

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,270
eating well, exercising, that you can push
off what may be considered the,

147
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,080
the destiny of various cormorbidiities.

148
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,600
And so AGNES became a great design tool.

149
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,880
That only later, frankly, through the eyes
of Dr.

150
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,780
Oz, of all folks, that, that had used
AGNES,

151
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,690
was understanding that this was something
that you could teach Baby Boomers, Gen X,

152
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,400
Gen Y, whatever generation number you're
up, letter we're up to, that how well you

153
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,630
live tomorrow, in your old age, is how
well you treat yourself today.

154
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,960
Miss Daisy is actually more that just a,

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,050
you know, a million dollar video game
simulator.

156
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,811
It actually, the color and

00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:58,293
the beatles is a symbol of fun and
