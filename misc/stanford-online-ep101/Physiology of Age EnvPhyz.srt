2
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:12,015
Where is Cory now?

3
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:17,320
Well we've flown all the way across the
country to Cambridge Massachusetts,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,350
where we're on the MIT Campus.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,170
And there are a lot of things that we
could do on the MIT campus.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,190
But we are interested in particular in the
age lab,

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,850
because this module is on the effects of
time on physiology.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,410
So, aging.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,530
And they do a lot of different things here
in the age lab,

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
like this car that we're in, Miss Daisy.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,820
They investigate how older drivers move
throughout the car, and

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,750
where they look, and how their response
time is.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,080
They work with corporations, and industry,
and

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,720
academics, and students in order to study
the impairments that occur with aging and

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,510
to design new products that will help that
process.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,380
But we are interested in particular in
Agnes, Age Gain Now Empathy System.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,650
It's a suit that's going to give this
healthy, young athletic person,

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,750
the feeling of aging.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,330
So some of the impairments associated with
aging.

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,640
So changes in his manual dexterity.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,370
Changes in his joint flexibility, in his
vision.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,000
And he's going to fatigue more quickly
with the weighted vest.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,210
So he gets to experience what it's like to
age, and

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,390
they get into a very interesting process.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,550
And then we're to use that to discuss some
of the things that

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,300
happen with the aging process, and how we
can prevent them in certain cases.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,460
So are you ready?

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,560
>> Very curious, I can't wait.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,130
>> Good, let's do it.

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,245
[MUSIC]

31
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,450
[laugh]

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,740
>> Life expectancy is about 30 to 40 years
longer than it was 100 years ago.

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,480
But we have yet to invent what we are
going to do to fill that time in.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,610
So this is Agnes.

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,860
Age gain now empathy system.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,950
And basically what Agnes is is a tool that
we developed for students and

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,240
for companies to work with to give that
ah-ha moment of

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,280
what it's like to do the simple things
that we take for granted, getting in and

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,650
out of the car, going shopping, opening up
a pill bottle or a box.

40
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,440
So we've got a variety of things that my
colleagues here in

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,360
the lab have designed to replicate that,
that tightening of the neck that

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,620
happens unfortunately in our 30s and 40s
if we don't stay as sharp, as we once did.

43
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,610
So we've got various straps and harnesses
and

44
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,140
the like to replicate the feeling of
stiffening joints around arthritis.

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,295
But this is not destiny.

46
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:28,560
One of the teachable moments we learned
about Agnus,

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,380
was that while we were using it as a tool
to give the approximation of a 75,

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,700
80 year old woman behaving badly with
diabetes and osteoarthritis, this is also

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,180
a teachable moment that with behaving well
and eating well, exercising, that you

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,340
can push off what may be considered the,
the destiny of various co-morbidities.

51
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,350
How well you live tomorrow in your old age
is how well you treat yourself today.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,040
>> Yes.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,100
Step into there and step into there.

54
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,050
I hope these fit you.

55
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,076
[MUSIC]

56
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:07,566
So the more foam that you have in shoes
the less proprioception you have,

57
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:10,840
the less feeling that you have of terrain.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,029
So we're using these knee braces.

59
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,030
Do you feel a little bit, oops, there it
went.

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,530
Okay.

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,220
We put gloves on to simulate the decreased
sensitivity to touch.

62
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,710
>> Uh-huh.
>> And particularly, as we get older, we,

63
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,571
we, we don't hear high-frequency sounds.

of it and just blow right through it.

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
I walked all the way around.

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,790
The ground is pretty unstable.

89
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:57,722
You know, I noticed it was a stressor for
me to get across the street in time.

>> Can you even see the light?

these people keep blowing through it.

faster and

96
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,910
they can jump out of the way of cars.

Well, that's why you have to stay active

So can you imagine exercising?

well, what do you think?

00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,310
Should we give it a try?

148
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,510
And see how these impairments impact your
ability to exercise?

149
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,210
Because we know that exercise is so good
for

150
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,301
you in changing the trajectory of aging.

you know, you may as well start now, start
exercising.

So when he's done with his workout, we're
going to sit down and

176
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,610
talk about his secrets of healthy aging.

177
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,780
>> See you in a minute.

178
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,300
>> See you in a minute.

179
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,920
Okay take care.
>> Bye.

180
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,460
>> What got you into sprinting and what
drives you to continue?

181
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,880
>> I remember the day well because I was
sitting in front of my TV watching

182
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,510
the 1968 Olympics, and I had a cigarette
in one hand and a beer in the other.

183
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,480
And I'm watching all of these outstanding
athletes and I just, I got mad at myself.

184
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,520
And so I put the cigarette out and I
crumpled up the pack and threw them away.

185
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,610
And I told myself okay, you're going to go
down to the track.

186
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,420
I lived by the San Carlos High School
track at the time.

187
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,733
And your going to go down there everyday
for two weeks.

188
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,990
Your going to make yourself run four laps.

189
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,910
And at the end of that two weeks you can
quit.

190
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,540
And I did that, and I never stopped.

191
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,150
And so for the next 37 years or

192
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,480
so I did a lot of trail running and a lot
of road running.

193
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,320
But I always had this love of the sprint.

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,270
One of the things that, that I've noticed
as I've gotten older,

195
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,610
is that people seem to think that easier
is better.

196
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,260
And they'll go out and

197
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,770
they'll buy this machine, to do something
that they could do, you know?

198
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,580
I still want to, if I want to dig a ditch
I don't go get a machine.

199
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,850
I'll get out my pick and shovel.

200
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,970
I still cut up my own firewood and I do
that, because I,

201
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,060
I actually enjoy it, it makes me feel
good, you know?

202
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,670
They think, or they'll say, well, you
know, I just turned 65, so I,

203
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,650
you know, I can't do that anymore.

204
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,820
Well, but I know guys that are 80 that are
doing it.

205
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,900
It's, that's the attitude part of it.

206
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,060
I was talking to a lady in an insurance
office and

207
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,640
she was telling me how she'd backed her
car into this pole a couple times.

208
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,410
And she said, because I, I can't turn.

209
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,020
She says it's just hard for me to turn.

210
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,950
Well, I, I know she wasn't close to my
age.

211
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,200
And, so I said to her, I said well, you
know,

212
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,680
every evening I just do this back
twisting.

213
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,710
I said, takes me five to ten seconds,
that's all.

214
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,090
Just a little bit, like that.

215
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,130
And, she kind of looked at me oh, I don't
do that stuff.

216
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,690
And all I could think was keep backing
into the pole.

217
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,600
>> So how old do you feel?

218
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,560
>> [LAUGH]
Oh about 79.

219
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,410
No.

220
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,450
It's again it's like I don't think of it
as old.

221
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,860
We think oh I'm old now because of this or
that and we put a number on it.

222
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,150
My dad was, when he turned 65 he was
designing a power plant in Korea and

223
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,550
they walked up to him on his birthday,
65th, and

224
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,210
said sorry John, we have to take you off
the project, you're too old now.

225
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,790
What do you mean?

226
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,070
Yesterday I wasn't and today I am?

227
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,686
It's that,

228
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:21,210
it's that whole attitude, I think that's
part of what should change in our culture.

229
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,500
Is that attitude of that old just means
you can't do anything anymore.

230
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,534
>> I think that.

231
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:35,672
