00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,600
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,550
Here in module seven we'll touch on a huge
topic.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,620
Aging and chronic disease.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,610
I say touch on the topic because there's
no way I can do it justice in

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,230
one short module.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,570
So again, because of my exercise
physiology background I will focus on

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,920
the benefits of physical activity, on the
diseases associated with aging.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,620
But even that will be just a taste of the
topic.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,275
There's a lot of other information out
there and

10
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,610
I'll provide a few review references in
the resources at the end of this section,

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,550
if you'd like to read more.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,580
If you think aging is a slow progression
of disease,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,940
physical activity can definitely help.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,910
It is the ultimate healthy aging pill.

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,230
Many doctors and researchers have
commented that if it were in

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,760
pill form it would be the biggest selling
drug of all time.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,610
It has beneficial effects on most of the
physiologic systems within the body.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,930
One important target of physical activity
is excess body fat and obesity.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,680
As you can see by the Center for Disease
Control graph to my right,

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,250
obesity rates have increased over the past
30 years.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,905
Estimates from 2010 were that 33% of U.S.
adults were overweight, 36% were obese,

22
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:14,360
and 6% were extremely obese, for a total
of three quarters of the U.S. population.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
Although other estimates are closer to two
thirds, its still quite stunning.

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,340
So what?

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,220
Why should we care about obesity rates?

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,710
Excess body fat is associated with 30
serious medical conditions and

27
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,470
chronic diseases associated with aging.

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,940
The financial and qualitative costs on
both an individual and

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,070
societal level are huge.

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,860
I could could go on and

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,200
on about this, but I suspect you're
already aware of the issues on this topic.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,620
Excess body weight is a problem on many
levels.

33
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,020
Why are we facing this crisis?

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,510
Clearly our body weight is a balance
between the calories that go in,

35
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,010
versus the calories that we expend.

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,618
Both sides of the equation have been
effected over the last 30 years.

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,390
In the U.S. and

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,500
many countries we're eating more, and what
we're eating is getting worse.

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,820
So more simple processed carbohydrates,
sugars, and high fructose corn syrup.

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,770
But that's only part of the problem.

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,680
Our energy expenditure has gone down as
well.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Not so much our exercise, like going out
for a jog, but our daily activity level.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,440
We have so many devices that make our
lives more convenient that we

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,030
have essentially engineered activity out
of out lives.

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,540
Again, I'm speaking from a U.S.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,340
perspective, but now we drive everywhere,
spend most of our leisure and

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,970
work time in front of screens, and send
emails instead of visiting people.

48
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,130
In the academic world we have printers at
our desks and

49
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,790
access all the information we need
electronically.

50
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,110
Way back when I was in grad school, if I
wanted a paper I'd have to go to

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,100
the library, search through these big
stacks of books to

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,860
get these huge bound books of journal,
carry the big books back to the copy room,

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,650
pay to copy the pages and then go back in
the stacks to get more books.

54
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,890
Now, I just look online and never leave my
desk.

55
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,860
These changes may not seem like a big
deal, but add it all together,

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,430
they can make a significant difference in
energy expenditure.

57
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,230
A study by Lanningham and Foster showed
that just changing a few things in

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,660
a person's daily routine, such as washing
the dishes by hand, taking the stairs

59
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,530
whenever available, and walking instead of
driving to work, an average of 0.8 miles,

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,620
resulted in an increased daily energy
expenditure of 111 calories.

61
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,920
That amount, or

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,769
more every day, thrown in with keeping an
eye on your diet, can really add up.

63
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,290
Physical activity, whether it be
recreational exercise or

64
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,550
activity within daily life, can help.

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,020
First, it can help with weight loss.

66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,280
It's hard to lose weight from exercise
alone, so

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,990
you have to be paying attention to intake
as well, but

68
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,120
physical activity can help tip the balance
towards fat use rather than storage.

69
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,460
Second, exercise can selectively cause the
loss of visceral fat.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,890
For example, a weight loss of 5% can
result in visceral fat loss of 25%.

71
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,450
Visceral fat is the fat that is stored
around the organs in your stomach region,

72
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,369
and is considered especially bad in the
terms of disease risk.

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,990
Fat is not just a passive storage site,

74
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,000
it is metabolically active tissue that
releases proteins and hormones called

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,880
adipokines that impact your health,
especially your sensitivity to insulin.

76
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,200
So a reduction in visceral fat can reduce
your risk for

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,240
type two diabetes and a whole host of
other illnesses,

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,480
like cardiovascular disease, high blood
pressure, etc.

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,290
Third, if you stay active you protect your
lean mass as you age.

80
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,610
That will maintain better physical
function for

81
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,410
you, as we've discussed, but will also
keep your metabolic rate higher.

82
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,780
Your body is well adapted to maintain its
weight, which is good for survival in

83
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,740
times of starvation, but not so good if
you're trying to drop a little body fat.

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,780
As you cut calories, if you're not
remaining active,

85
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,270
your body will slow its metabolic rate to
protect your body mass.

86
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,440
Exercise both raises metabolic rate
directly and

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,440
gives you more metabolically active muscle
tissue so you're burning calories 24/7.

88
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,490
Finally, physical activity, integrated
into daily life, can reduce sitting time.

89
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,710
Sitting has emerged as an independent risk
factor for disease.

90
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,530
Meaning, even if you get your recommended
30 minutes a day, five days a week of

91
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,720
activity, but you sit the rest of the
time, you're putting yourself at risk.

92
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,640
So anything you can do to reduce the time
in a car, sitting at work, or

93
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,119
in front of a TV could help.

94
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,020
It's hypothesized that even if you don't
reduce your total sitting time but you

95
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,260
interrupt your sitting with short standing
or walking periods, it could help.

96
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,420
I hear crickets every 50 minutes or so at
work because my coworkers down stairs have

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,630
set their phones to chirp as a reminder to
get up regularly and move around.

98
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,730
Whenever I walk down stairs in those
periods they're stretching and marching.

99
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,950
It's very inspiring, and it's a great
idea.

100
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,192
Physical activity isn't just beneficial as
a weight management program,

101
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:22,262
it impacts a whole bunch of diseases.

102
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,030
To my right are some examples.

103
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,310
Arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, type two
diabetes, and many more.

104
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,610
The diseases on the list have been well
researched and

105
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,950
we know now, not only the physic, that
physical activity does work, but

106
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,630
we know the mechanism of how it works as
well.

107
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,570
Sometimes it is mediated through body fat
loss, but

108
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,369
there are many other mechanisms
independent of body weight.

109
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,170
And, a bonus, unlike many drugs that tre,
treat just the symptoms of disease,

110
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,600
physical activity can treat the underlying
causes.

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,370
For example, as I mention on the last
slide, exercise can reduce visceral fat.

112
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,810
It releases adipokines that can cause
insulin resistance that is at the root of

113
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,809
type two diabetes.

114
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,920
The second bonus is that you can get some
benefit from exercise in

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,190
terms of reducing di, disease risk, even
if you start later in life.

116
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,120
To my right is a typical graph
illustrating average function over

117
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,700
the lifespan.

118
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,480
You could put in muscle strength,
cognitive function, bone density, VO2 max,

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,900
whatever, on the Y-axis.

120
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,870
For the adult lifespan, you could label
the graph with health as well.

121
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,960
The general pattern is that things go up
for a while, and

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,495
then they go down for a while.

123
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:48,200
[LAUGH] If you exercise for your whole
life, then your peaks will be higher,

124
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,810
the fall off both in adulthood and old age
will be less steep.

125
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,378
Thus, you will hopefully avoid that
threshold of disability in

126
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,010
your later years.

127
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,750
You're essentially changing the trajectory
of your own

128
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,259
aging through physical activity.

129
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,450
You can even get a bump up if you start
exercising in mid or later life.

130
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,505
For example, the diba, the diabetes
prevention program, which was a large,

131
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:18,030
multi-center trial, showed that people
over 60 who started a program of diet and

132
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,300
exercise, could reduce their risk of type
two diabetes by more than 70%.

133
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,050
So get out there and start doing it.

134
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,340
I've talked about lifestyle activity and
small changes that can add up throughout

135
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,280
the day, and you may be wondering, does
that really make a difference?

136
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,930
Well the good news is that some of the
biggest gains can be obtained at

137
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,110
the low end of the spectrum.

138
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,700
Meaning, that there's a lot of room for

139
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,290
improvement if you haven't been doing any
exercises at all.

140
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,320
For example, on the fitness scale, panel A
above, unfit people may be able to

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,970
improve their aerobic capacity by 30% if
they start a new,

142
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,680
well planned exercise program.

143
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,780
In contrast, elite athletes may train and

144
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,540
train and only improve aerobic capacity by
2%.

145
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Because they've reached the high end of
their genetic potential and

146
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,860
are on the flat part of the upper curve.

147
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,460
That's often when they consider
performance enhancing drugs,

148
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,440
to sort of bump themselves up off that
flat curve.

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,540
But that's a whole other discussion.

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,920
Anyway, in curve B, getting the least fit
people a little bit

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,960
more active can cause the greatest disease
risk and all cause mortality.

152
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,200
It doesn't mean that over most of the
spectrum, more isn't better, but

153
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,280
there is a law of diminishing returns.

154
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,310
And some data even suggests at the really,
really high,

155
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,840
ultra endurance level curve B may even tip
up a little in terms of cardiac health

156
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,510
at the end, meaning there may be some long
term problems.

157
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,650
But don't panic if that applies to you,
it's still being investigated.

158
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,040
Although I didn't have time to talk about
data that support the benefits of

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,500
physical activity on disease risk I assure
you, it does work.

160
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,170
Just remember physical activity is truly
the healthy aging pill.

161
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,070
If your doctor offered you a drug that
could reduce your risk of

162
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,720
cardiovascular disease by 50%, reduce bad
cholesterol by 67% and

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,320
had the side effects of reducing risk for
type two diabetes in cancer,

164
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,220
lowering blood pressure, enhancing weight
loss, improving mood and

165
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,470
cognitive function, lowering rates of
depression, improving strength,

166
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,910
increasing functional capacity, and
perhaps even increasing longevity.

167
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,590
Would you take it?

168
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,630
Of course you would.

169
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,229
You'd probably even pay a lot for it.

170
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,590
So in summary, physical activity won't
solve the obesity epidemic but

171
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,510
it can help directly by assisting with
weight loss, or

172
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,960
indirectly by reducing symptoms and risks
associated with obesity.

173
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,150
Second, physical activity can reduce the
risk of

174
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,630
many age-associated chronic diseases by
targeting the underlying causes of risk.

175
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,280
Third, physical activity can be started at
any time and

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,950
produce some amount of benefit.

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,000
And four, in people who are very unfit to
start with even small amounts can

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,570
help with health and fitness.

179
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,460
By the way, I was going to discuss how

180
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,570
exercise interacts with immune function in
terms of the common cold in this module.

181
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,310
But it was getting too long.

182
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,300
For those of you who want to learn whether
exercises make you sick or

183
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,640
healthier, and whether you should exercise
if you already have a cold,

184
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,400
check the short bonus topic video at the
end of this section.

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,820
Thanks for your attention.

186
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,660
Next up in module eight, unique
considerations for

187
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,590
the masters athletes, [SOUND] fun.
