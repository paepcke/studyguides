1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:06,166
[NOISE] Come on, almost there.

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,780
[NOISE] Come on.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,280
[CROSSTALK] You got it.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,060
You got it.
You got it.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,120
You're almost there.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,150
>> Come on, come on, come on.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,570
Come on.
>> Come on, Corey!

8
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,130
>> Where's Corey now?

9
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,710
Well, we're just outside of Boston in
Natick Massachusetts at USARIEM,

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,370
the US Army Research Institute of
Environmental Medicine.

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,640
And this module's going to be on high
altitude physiology.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,450
When you're at high altitude, you're at
one of the most stressful environments you

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,400
can be in, because the oxygen that's
available for your use is greatly reduced.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,260
And so your body goes through a whole
series of

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,910
systemic adaptations that tries to
accommodate that low oxygen availability.

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,740
And we're here with the altitude chamber,
one of the premiere chambers in the world

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,550
where they've done studies for years on
taking people up to high altitude.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,138
>> So what we're going to do today is prep
you for your PhysioFlow.

19
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,450
What the PhysioFlow is going to do is give
us a measure of your cardiac output,

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,060
along with some simple measures like heart
rate and stroke volume.

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,950
We're going to do three EKG leads, and
three leads that are going to be more for

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,990
our cardiac output measure.

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,912
>> And they've done studies taking them to
the top of Everest at 29,000 feet.

24
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,800
Now, we're not going to take Cory that
high.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,780
We're only going to go to about 10,000
feet, but

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,629
we're going to have him exercise to
maximum.

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,560
Both at sea level and at altitude and so
we're going to see how he responds

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,140
differently at those two elevations and
how his body tries to compensate for that.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,220
>> Take off your shirt.

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,730
So I'm going to glove up for sanitary
reasons.

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,298
We don't know what we're going to get into
here.

32
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,777
>> That's an excellent idea.

33
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:32,239
>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH].

34
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,900
[INAUDIBLE].

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,730
>> So Corey's going to have some kind of
fun now.

36
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,350
Because, we're going to be looking at his
maximum exercise capacity.

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,530
Both at sea level, and then again, at
10,000 feet in the chamber.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,660
And, we're going to measure a variety of
things.

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,640
It'll give us an indication of what's
going on in his body.

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,500
So, we're going to have these electrodes
on his chest.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,290
That'll measure heart rate, stroke volume,
and cardiac output; So

42
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,990
how much blood he's pumping from the heart
per minute.

43
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,335
He'll have a little device on his finger,
the pulse oximeter,

44
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,790
that'll measure his oxygen saturation, so

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,580
how much oxygen is being delivered to his
tissues during the exercise.

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,500
The headgear and mouthpiece he'll be
wearing will feed into a machine that'll

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,240
tell us how much oxygen he's using to do
the work, and

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,550
then how much air is coming in and out of
his lungs; so his ventilation rate.

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,170
We'll get a sense of how much pain he's in
with the RPE scale,

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,770
the rate of perceived exertion, so he'll
be pointing to a number there and

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,859
then we'll of course get the maximum watts
that he achieves during the test.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,810
After the test, we'll have a sense of how
his brain was impacted by this low O2.

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,460
So we'll give him a reaction time test on
an iPhone.

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,090
And then finally we'll see if he's feeling
at all sick; so if he has any symptoms of

55
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,880
acute mountain sickness, using the Lake
Louise questionnaire.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,300
But with all those together, we'll have a
good sense of how that lack of O2 and

57
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,140
that reduction of the O2 at 10,000 feet
will impact his exercise performance,

58
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,745
his brain, and how he feels.

59
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,400
[LAUGH]

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,841
>> I'm here with my good friends, Steve
Muza and Chuck Fulco.

61
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,000
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,910
And so, since they run the show, they're
going to be taking Cory through this test.

63
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,410
So, every two minutes, he's going to pedal
harder and

64
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,940
harder against a greater resistance.

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,170
And he's going to go until he can't go any
more.

66
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,340
So, this is going to be his maximum
capacity, maximum aerobic capacity.

67
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,620
So, we are ready to go.

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,229
And Cory, are you all set to do the test?

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,060
Ready to go.

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,570
>> Alright.
>> Let's do it.

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,150
>> Let's do it.

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,800
>> Periodically, I'm going to hold this
sign up.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,680
This is procedure to.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,832
>> Sorry, got to [CROSSTALK].

75
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:37,400
[INAUDIBLE]
>> This is it.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,158
I'm going to win that 10,000.

77
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:40,200
Woo!
>> You want that again?

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,140
>> What level are we at now?

79
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,220
>> 2,000 [LAUGH].

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,151
Okay, we're at 4,000.

81
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:48,510
Not even a dent?

82
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,201
>> Not even a dent.

83
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,013
>> Corey, We're at 10,000 feet
>> Yes.

84
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:56,588
>> And we're going to do a maximal oxygen
consumption test exactly as we did it at

85
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:57,155
sea level.

86
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,008
>> Okay.

87
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:01,699
>> And we're going to complete our every
workload, every px like you did last time,

88
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,070
so everything is identical.

89
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,030
So, are you ready for it?

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,690
>> Yeah.

91
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,940
All right.
>> Let's do this.

92
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,182
>> Okay, Corey, we'll start [INAUDIBLE]
right at 50 watts.

93
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,416
>> Okay, 50 watts.

94
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,602
>> Okay, we're only now at 100 watts, been
there for

95
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:18,800
about 20 seconds, and look at this!

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,330
Corey's saturation is falling.

97
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,780
His level has dropped down to about 90%
versus

98
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,563
staying stabilized roughly 97, 98% at low
altitude.

99
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,564
>> Isn't physiology grand?

100
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,590
>> That's science right there.

101
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,546
>> What are we going up to?

102
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:38,240
>> [CROSSTALK] to 150 liters per minute.

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,540
>> The important thing is his oxygen in
his blood is still 98%

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,380
of his hemoglobin is saturated.

105
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,826
>> [CROSSTALK] [CROSSTALK]
>> Burn.

106
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,026

>> Alright, Cory, alright, Cory.

107
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,696
Going up to 250.

That's it Cory.

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,570
>> Bringing it down, okay.

128
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,840

it's probably the best way of describing
it.
