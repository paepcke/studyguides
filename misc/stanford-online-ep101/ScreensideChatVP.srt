00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,420
Our last section, variable pressure.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,520
Kind of a sad moment.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,720
But also a nice moment.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,910
A moment of accomplishment,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,930
a moment when it's almost time to look
back on all we've done together.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,440
We have all sorts of stuff going on in
this module,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,870
sort of threw a bunch of crazy things in
there.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,340
We flew fighter jets.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,780
Something that I never thought I would do,
ever.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,620
We have diving.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,540
We have free diving.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,930
Scuba, micro-gravity.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,526
You're glasses are totally steaming up.

14
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,680
[LAUGH].
Can you you even see me?

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,808
>> Actually, I can't see anything.

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:37,977
>> [LAUGH].

17
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:38,630
Hello?

18
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,240
How many fingers am I holding up?

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,305
>> Got a little nitrogen narcosis going
on.

20
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:42,950
>> [LAUGH].

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,280
That's good.
Good demo.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,302
You going to start acting drunk?

23
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:46,088
[LAUGH]

24
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:46,880
>> [SOUND]

25
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,320
>> Corey's also, he has a little bit of a
head cold.

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,680
So, he's a little delirious.

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,850
So, if he says anything unusual it's
because of that.

28
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,190
How you doing Corey?

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,050
>> I'm doing good.

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,400
I got nothing.
>> [LAUGH] Nothing.

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,650
>> I got nothing.

32
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,920
>> You've been talking at the camera for
six weeks and you've got nothing now?

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,570
The last chance.

34
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,300
>> Yeah, well, okay.

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,200
Let me tell you.

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,155
I've got one last thing to say.

37
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,610
>> [LAUGH] The camera's over there.

38
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,800
This has been a pretty awesome journey
that we've been able to share with you.

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,670
And unfortunately, we're, we're rounding
down to the end.

40
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,880
This is our last section.

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,650
Which is unbelievable.

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,390
It's not our last video, there'll be one
more goodbye video that we'll share with

43
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,540
you guys, but this unbelievable journey is
finally closing in on us, so.

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,620
>> Yeah.

45
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,040
So thank you so much for sharing with us
along the way, we are pretty pumped.

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,770
Has been some highs and

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,550
some lows, and good times and bad times,
>> Yeah.

48
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,515
>> So, So hopefully, you're a little sad
too, and not actually relieved.

49
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:01,670
[LAUGH] One thing, just like in the very
first check in when I

50
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,490
said please fill out the survey, please
fill out the end of the class survey.

51
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,540
This is your last week in the class.

52
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,690
This really helps us move forward.

53
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,210
It helps us do things better next time.

54
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,540
If you have comments on things that we
should add next time,

55
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,730
topics you're interested in,

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,860
things we can do better, Whether you
learned something in the class.

57
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,160
Now that's helpful for us because, you
know,

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,110
we'll need to go forward and try to make
more of these and

59
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,170
we need some support to get additional
funding momentum.

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,650
So if you think this class was a useful
format and

61
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,000
effective,then we'd love to hear about it.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,300
So thank you for that and please do take
the five or

63
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,390
ten minutes to fill in the survey.

64
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,370
>> Yeah, and your positive testimonials
will justify to Nadine and

65
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,290
other funny sources that what we did was,
was worth it.

66
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,130
>> Not that we're trying to bias you or
anything.

67
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,120
[LAUGH] What you feel that.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,860
We want criticism as well.

69
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,215
But the good stuff is really helpful.

70
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:59,250
[LAUGH] So enjoy the last module, we've
got a little bit of everything.

71
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,520
We have, you know, we talk to astronauts,
we fly plans, we go underwater.

72
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,010
And hopefully you'll enjoy that very much.

73
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,050
And then, see you on the other side for a
final check in.

74
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,530
>> Yeah, see you on the physiology of
variable pressure.

75
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,030
>> Take care.

76
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,630
Bye.
