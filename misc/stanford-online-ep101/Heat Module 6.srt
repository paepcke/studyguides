1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,764
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:05,627
We've arrived at the last module for this
section on heat.

3
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:09,872
Risks, Consequences and Practical Tips.

4
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:14,280
Let's start with dehydration, otherwise
known as hypohydration.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,620
We've referred to it throughout our
discussions, but we haven't yet

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,310
talked about it directly.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,248
Dehydration has varied degrees of
severity.

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,410
At about 1% of body weight fluid loss,

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,870
the osmolarity of the blood increases,
which induces a thirst response.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,170
Fluid losses on the order of 2 to 3% of
body waste,

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,950
weight, start to negatively impact
performance.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,100
Then as you can see on the slide beside
me,

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,520
things deteriorate more seriously as the
level of dehydration worsens.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,450
Moving through discomfort and lethargy, to
more dangerous levels and

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,180
eventually death.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,000
If fluids are available throughout an
event, most athletes are pretty good at

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,450
keeping their dehydration levels less than
2% through practice and or thirst.

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,955
Not all performance is effected equally by
dehydration.

19
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:06,210
At a 2 to 3% decrease in body fluids,
single sprints, strengths, or

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,580
ballistic movements, or sport skills are
not measurably impacted.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,090
However, certain activities like
sprinting,

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,740
may be impacted by offsetting effects,
like decrease in

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,490
power countered by a lower body weight
equals the same performance.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,340
On the other hand, aerobic exercise,
repeat sprints, and team sports of

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,080
varying types have been shown in studies
to be impaired by moderate dehydration.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,650
The pattern of activities is similar to
those impacted by hypothermia, so

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,730
some of the mechanisms likely overlap.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,360
Obviously getting dehydrated is not
optimal,

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,770
however the opposite can be worse.

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,100
Given the strong emphasis on drink, drink,

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,920
drink, certain recreational sports
participants and ultra endurance

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,010
athletes are at risk of drinking too much
which can lead to hyponatremia.

33
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,700
Hyponatremia or low sodium causes excess
fluid in the blood to

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,050
be drawn into the extracellular spaces
such as the brain.

35
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,640
Excess fluid in the brain can press on the
brain stem, suppress breathing, and

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,390
can be fatal.

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,560
As more slower marathon runners are taking
to the courses with

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,760
ample opportunity to drink water, their
sweat rates may not exceed their intake.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,460
Thus, runners may actually put on water
weight during an event.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,620
Additional effort should be made to point
out the risks in both directions.

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,430
There are many guidelines out there for

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,680
hydration, but all of them have a common
theme.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,180
Avoid dehydration of more than 2%, and
don't drink so

44
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,960
much that you gain weight in an event.

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,570
In addition to the recommendations listed
to my right, other

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,900
suggestions include choose a drink that is
cold in temperature and tastes good.

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,640
The more palatable it is, the more you
will drink.

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,910
Also, if it includes electrolytes, you
will reduce the risk of hyponatremia.

49
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,770
After prolonged exercise, ingest a
carbohydrate and electrolyte solution.

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,420
In addition, avoid carbonated drinks, as
they make you feel full and

51
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,660
decrease fluid intake.

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,900
Heat cramps.

53
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,650
Heat cramps occur in the large muscles of
the legs, arms, and

54
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,180
abdomen, usually after several hours of
strenuous activity.

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,910
They're common in people that have lost a
large volume of salt and

56
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,840
water through exercise.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,880
It can be delayed a few hours after the
event.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,090
Because they often happen in hot
environments, when people have lost lots

59
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,770
of sweat, the causes were originally
thought to be dehydration and a loss of

60
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,220
electrolytes, resulting in an inability to
control contraction and relaxation.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,060
However, more recent research suggests
that as the muscles tire from

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,470
excess activity and work, they lose their
ability to

63
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,740
regulate contraction due to altered neural
muscular control.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,850
Although heat cramps can be painful,

65
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,210
they usually don't result in any permanent
damage.

66
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,710
Heat acclimatization and possibly
electrolyte beverages may

67
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,999
decrease the risk of experiencing heat
cramps.

68
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,260
Both of these are prudent, regardless of
whether they reduce heat cramps or not.

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,750
If you're experiencing heat cramps, move
to a cool place to rest,

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,350
drink electrolytes, and perform gentle
stretches on the affected muscle groups.

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,730
Heat cramps are considered the first step
on a continuum of heat illness.

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,150
A warning sign of sorts.

73
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,650
The next step on that continuum is heat
exhaustion.

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,410
As the slide to my right indicates, with
heat exhaustion,

75
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,000
you may experience profuse sweating, cool
skin, and goose bumps.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,070
Have you ever felt that?

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,184
Very hot but suddenly you get the chills.

78
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:45,600
That's a sign that you're having some
thermoregulatory issues.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,730
You also may have a rapid weak pulse and
low blood pressure as your body tries to

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,260
compensate for the excessive vasodilat,
vasodilation to the skin.

81
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,740
Dizziness, disorientation,
lightheadedness, nausea, and

82
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,270
headache are also associated with heat
exhaustion.

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,790
This condition should be taken seriously.

84
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,270
The treatment is similar to heat cramps,
but more pressing.

85
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,938
Stop all activity, rest in a cool place,
and drink cool water or sports drink.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,470
If you don't take this seriously, it can
lead to the next stage of heat illness.

87
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,330
Heat stroke.

88
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,620
Heat stroke is a medical emergency and can
kill you.

89
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,030
About half the people with heat stroke
keep sweating, but the other half stop.

90
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,950
Skin will be hot and dry in the latter
group.

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,840
Core temperature can get to be higher than
104 degrees fahrenheit with

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,070
rapid heart rate, confusion, or
unconsciousness.

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,960
Essentially you're at risk of cooking your
organs and your brain.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,350
It is fatal in about 20% of people and
those that survive are predisposed

95
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,330
to heat stroke in the future, partially
because of damaged sweat glands.

96
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,510
If you put all of these illnesses and

97
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,610
symptoms together, it looks something like
this.

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,730
Going from upper, your upper left to your
bottom right,

99
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,300
the symptoms get more and more serious.

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,850
But they're all a continuum of the same
process of overheating.

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,740
Be careful and

102
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,130
interrupt that deterioration before you
get too far along the continuum.

103
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,770
Keep an eye on those you are with as well,

104
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,909
to make sure they are not exhibiting these
symptoms.

105
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,250
We've talked about the initial treatments
and

106
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,750
the context of heat cramps and heat
exhaustion already.

107
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,920
But what about when it gets more serious?

108
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,330
Traditional treatments include lying a
person down and elevating their feet.

109
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,340
That helps return the blood back to the
brain if they're having difficulty coping

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,430
with the excessive peripheral vasodilation
and are feeling faint.

111
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,880
Remove excess clothing and put cold
compresses on the face, neck, armpits and

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,590
groin, those non hairy surfaces.

113
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,200
A recent unpublished study out of Craig
Keller's lab at Stanford suggests that

114
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,370
the face, which is not as commonly used
for

115
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,050
cold compresses, is actually one of the
effective regions for cooling.

116
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,800
You can also mist someone with a fan to
aid evaporation cooling and

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,750
of course, seek medical assistance.

118
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,910
According to the CDC, an average of 675
people

119
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,670
in the United States die of heat-related
complications every year.

120
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,670
That is more than from tornadoes,
hurricanes, floods, lightning, and

121
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,490
any other weather event combined.

122
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,390
The most susceptible are the elderly,
individuals with other illnesses, or

123
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,220
people working or playing sports outside.

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,170
It is not an insignificant problem.

125
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,510
Every year, a number of young football
players succumb to heat stroke.

126
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,750
Be careful out there with yourselves, your
parents, and your kids.

127
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,240
Alright, one last topic before we finish
up.

128
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,670
Hypothermia and pregnancy.

129
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,230
This is important because hypothermia puts
your baby at risk for neural tube defects.

130
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,920
What happens is within the six, first six
weeks of pregnancy,

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,960
a neural tube birth defect is an opening
in the spinal cord or brain of a baby.

132
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,670
The early spinal cord of the embryo begins
as a flat layer of cells,

133
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,530
which rolls into a tube 28 days after the
baby is conceived.

134
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,910
This process can be impacted by high body
temperature and

135
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,930
many women don't even know that they're
pregnant that early.

136
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,650
This is especially problematic for

137
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,600
female endurance athletes like marathon
runners, who frequently get their core

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,460
temperature up to 40 degrees centigrade in
hot environments during competition.

139
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,210
Endurance athletes may have irregular
menstrual cycles,

140
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,239
which makes it harder for them to know
whether they are pregnant.

141
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,570
If you think you might be pregnant, or
trying to get pregnant,

142
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,910
be careful of hot tubs, or hot baths
lasting more than then minutes, and

143
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,040
prolonged, intense exercise that raises
body temperature.

144
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,490
Also if you have a fever,

145
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,850
be sure to seek medical assistance to
manage your symptoms in a safe way.

146
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,840
If you think you've been hyperthermic
during your pregnancy, you should talk

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,460
with your physician to see if they
recommend screening tests for your baby.

148
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,010
Congratulations for finishing the
physiology of heat section.

149
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,050
Hey, I've got a joke for you.

150
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,570
What does a bee do when it's hot?

151
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,210
It takes off its yellow jacket [LAUGH].

152
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,260
Stay cool, thanks for participating.
