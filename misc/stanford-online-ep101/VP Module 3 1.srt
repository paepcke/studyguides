1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,530
When we go up in altitude, we experience
low pressures.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,350
But when we go down underwater, we
experience high pressures.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,270
Of course we increase the pressure a whole
lot faster when we dive underwater,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,250
because water is almost 800 times denser
than air.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,040
Underwater, it can be beautiful and
tranquil, but

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,130
it can also expose us to a whole new set
of challenges, including breathing.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,140
That's a big one.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Temperature control, viability, and
boyensey.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,780
There are are a couple of typical ways to
get under water and

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,170
we'll talk about each of them briefly.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,760
First is scuba diving.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,440
Where you bring your air with you and you
keep breathing under water.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,090
The second is free diving, where you hold
your breath for

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,299
extended periods of time while your under
water.

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,780
Now even though the surrounding
environment can be the same between these

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,790
two types of dives, the stresses on the
body are quite different.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,790
For example, when you scuba dive, you
continue to breathe, so

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,130
your lungs essentially stay the same size
as you go deeper and deeper.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,310
In contrast, when you free dive as you go
down the pressure increases,

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,940
your lungs get squeezed becoming smaller
and

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,950
smaller because' there's no new air coming
in to balance that pressure.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,660
As you can imagine the risks and

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,249
sensations are not the same between the
two sports.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,580
In 1943, Jacques Cousteau and Emile Gagnan
invented the aqua lung, or

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,740
more commonly called the self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,030
Scuba.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,580
Although not the first underwater
breathing device, it was the most popular.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,290
And it revolutionized underwater
exploration.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,940
Since then, there have been many advances
in the equipment but

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,290
even so, a well-equipped diver today can
still carry between 65 and

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,154
70 pounds of gear in the water.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,050
The picture to my right shows the basic
equipment that you

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,860
need to deal with the underwater
challenges.

34
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,320
A wet or dry suit to deal with cold
temperatures, mask for

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,090
visibility, Fins for mobility.

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,860
Weight belt for buoyancy.

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,240
And of course, tanks and regulators for
breathing.

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,140
The tanks can be filled with compressed
ambient air, or

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,710
nitrox, which is a mixture of gas with
higher oxygen and lower nitrogen content.

40
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,380
Nitrox has the advantage of reducing the
risk of nitrogen narcosis, and

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,130
allows a diver to stay under water longer.

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,800
However, nitrox also increases the risk of
oxygen toxicity for given depth.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
We'll talk more about that physiology
later.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,650
Trimix tanks add a third inert gas to the
mix for deeper dives,

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,500
to limit the negative effects of both
nitrogen and oxygen under high pressures.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,590
The breathing devices are usually
open-circuit, meaning the bri, the diver

47
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,890
breathes in from the tank and out into the
water, creating bubbles of the unused gas.

48
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,560
However, there's certain applications like
the military, for

49
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,530
example, where they don't want bubbles.

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,930
And they want to be able to stay down
longer.

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,540
In those situations, they use
closed-circuit breathing.

52
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,900
And that's an area that equipment
regulation is much trickier, and the CO2

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,940
produced by our bodies has to be carefully
scrubbed or removed, otherwise the diver

54
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,420
can start to hyperventilate and get
delirious while they're down underwater.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,740
On the surface of the ocean, the pressure
is one atmosphere, or

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,000
760 millimeters of mercury.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,950
As you descend deeper and deeper your body
experiences the continued pressure of

58
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,210
the one atmosphere plus the pressure of
the additional water above.

59
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,660
When you reach 30 meters or

60
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,220
100 feet the pressure that your body feels
is about four atmospheres.

61
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,440
There are a variety of things that happen
due to these increased pressures.

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,900
First relates to Boyle's Law which says
the volume of gas is

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,390
dependent on the surrounding pressure.

64
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,760
So as you go deeper air in the stasis and

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,870
sinuses and the ear canal get compressed
causing a feeling of pressure and pain.

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,120
Divers must equalize the pressure in these
spaces by variety of

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,639
methods like plugging the nose and blowing
lightly.

68
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,570
The change in pressure is not a problem if
you can equalize,

69
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,550
but if you have a cold or allergies that
prevent equalibration it can result in

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,300
a great deal of discomfort and even a
ruptured ear drum.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,870
Also, air needs to flow freely in and

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,700
out of the lungs when changing depth,
especially when surfacing.

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,850
So never hold your breath.

74
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,630
As the pressure decreases on the way up
the air in the lungs can expand,

75
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,420
if not expel, and can either block
circulation or damage lung tissue.

76
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,540
Henry's Law says that the amount of gas
that dissolves into a solution is

77
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,210
dependent on the pressure of the gas.

78
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,080
Therefore as the pressure increases, more
nitrogen and

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,360
oxygen dissolve into the blood.

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,980
This can be problematic both while you're
underwater and

81
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,270
when you come back up to the surface.

82
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,990
We'll talk more about that on the next
slide.

83
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,650
The underwater environment presents a
variety of challenges.

84
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,560
As we talked about in the cold section,

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,440
cool water can draw heat away from the
body rapidly.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,820
The cooler the water, the more thermal
protection is needed, and or

87
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,940
the shorter the dive should be.

88
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,190
If shivering starts, it's a warning sign
of approaching hypothermia and

89
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,319
the dive should be ended.

90
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,660
Although many people think of SCUBA diving
as a lazy floating activity,

91
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,060
it can be quite physically demanding.

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,900
Between hauling all that equipment around,
fighting possible currents,

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,290
and covering distance against the
increased resistance of water,

94
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,780
a fair amount of work needs to be done.

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,640
Caloric expenditure for recreational
divers has been estimated around 250 to

96
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,130
300 kcals for 30 minutes of a dive time at
let's say, 30 to 60 feet of water.

97
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,320
That's a low to moderate activity level
and

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
should be accounted for in pre and post
dive caloric intake.

99
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,530
Also remember that it's harder to keep
yourself warm if you run out of

100
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,300
calories and become hypoglycemic.

101
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:55,380
Numbers 3 through 5 on the list to my
right result from the increased amount of

102
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,689
gases dissolved in blood and tissue at the
higher pressures.

103
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,860
Oxygen is obviously critical to our
survival, but just like anything else,

104
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,200
water, chocolate cake [LAUGH], too much of
a good thing can cause serious problems.

105
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Even if a diver has normal compressed air
in the tank, so at 20% oxygen,

106
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,560
at 130 feet, she will be breathing the
equivalent number of oxygen mol,

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,059
molecules per breath as 100% oxygen on the
surface.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,120
With normal air is not usually an issue
until a diver reaches about 200 feet.

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,880
But with the higher O2 content of nitrox,

110
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,810
oxygen toxicity can happen at shallower
depths.

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,480
High systemic oxygen levels affects the
central nervous system.

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,860
It can cause tremors, seizures, ringing in
the ears, nausea and tunnel vision.

113
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,690
Can also lead to drowning or decompression
sickness if

114
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,700
a diver tries to ascend too quickly in
response to those uncomfortable symptoms.

115
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,180
Number four, high levels of nitrogen
dissolved in the blood can

116
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,679
interfere with nerve signalling, which can
cause nitrogen narcosis.

117
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,410
Nitrogen narcosis is also called rapture
of

118
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,480
the deep because the symptoms mimic
alcohol intoxication to a certain extent.

119
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,690
Euphoric feelings, lapses in
concentration, loss of good judgment.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
Simply enjoying the feeling is a bad idea
and

121
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,490
can lead to risky decisions that can put
you and others at risk.

122
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,770
If you start feeling the symptoms coming
on, move to shallower water.

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,180
Decompression sickness is the more
dangerous cousin of Nitrogen Narcosis.

124
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,300
As the diver descends nitrogen not only
gets absorbed into the blood, but

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,550
also into the tissues like fat, tendons,
and cartilage.

126
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,200
As the diver goes back up, the nitrogen
reverses its path, and comes back out.

127
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,070
If the ascent is slow enough, nitrogen
comes out in

128
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,960
small bubbles that enter the bloodstream
and are harmlessly excreted by the lungs.

129
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,400
However, if the ascent rate is too fast,
large bubbles form that

130
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,010
can block circulation, compress nerves,
and form dangerous chemical reactions.

131
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,940
Sort of like opening a bottle of
carbonated soda, and

132
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,280
the bubbles suddenly appear.

133
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,920
You've probably heard of divers getting
the bends.

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,610
This is caused by one form of
decompression sickness,

135
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,650
where nitrogen bubbles block the small
vessels of joints causing pain that

136
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,970
can be partially relieved by bending the
affected joints.

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,090
First aid for decompression sickness
ranges from

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,170
breathing 100% oxygen taking aspirin,
drinking fluid and resting for

139
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,395
minor cases to full re-compression in a
chamber for more serious cases.

140
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:42,200
Re-compression causes the bubbles to
redissolve into the blood and

141
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,290
tissues until the person can be
depressurized more slowly.

142
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,480
Clearly the best treatment is prevention.

143
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,530
There are many dive tables and computers
that let divers determine how much

144
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,540
nitrogen is being absorbed, how long it is
safe to stay at certain depths,

145
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,670
how quickly they can come up, and how soon
they can either dive or fly again.

146
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,450
Think for a moment.

147
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,620
Why do you think divers need to be wary of
both subsequent diving and flying?

148
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,480
See if you can figure it out in the check
for understanding questions.

149
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,940
Okay, that's it for scuba.

150
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,660
Take a little mini break if you need it,
and

151
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,430
then come back for the exciting world of
free diving.
