[SOUND]

2
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:10,809
>> Here we are, at our first weekly
check-in.

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:12,861
>> Our first screen-side chat.

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,740
>> Screen-side chat, by the warm fire.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,150
This is the cold section, so we're bundled
up after just coming inside.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,600
And the purpose of these check ins is
really just to check in, with all of you.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,260
Talk about what happened last week.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,850
What's going to happen with the next week.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,490
>> Yeah, it's really it's really our
opportunity to,

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,670
at the beginning of every section, check
in with you, let you

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,310
know where we're headed and give you some
of our reflections on where we've been.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,460
And give you a chance to get to know us a
little bit better.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,530
It's a little bit of a risk because I'm
not sure if you'll like us very much.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,760
>> [LAUGH] Beware.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,310
>> But we figured we'd, we'd give it a
shot.

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,210
>> Yeah, and since it's our first week,

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,780
we don't have a lot to talk about last
week, but one thing I would like to

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,430
emphasize is that right before this weekly
check-in there's a section, with a survey.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,790
And, we would really appreciate if you'd
take the five to ten minutes to

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,670
fill it out.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,620
We offer, this class for free.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,490
A lot of resources have gone into it and

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,260
one of the things that we hope to get out
of it for us is to learn, about you.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,530
And who's taking the class, and how you
like to learn, and what's effective and

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,530
what's not.

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,110
So by taking that little bit of time for
us at the beginning and

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,640
then at the end, for the follow-up server,
survey, you can really help us.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,210
And you can really help us create the next
generation that's even bigger and

29
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,730
better than the last one.

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,630
So please, if you haven't done it already,
go back and do that.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,700
>> And then after you take the survey,

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,660
you can join us on our first journey in
the cold.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,880
And, this was our first, our first video.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,220
That's where we started.

35
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,710
Actually, before we even had a plan for
making a class at all.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,530
Sort of our impromptu first video.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,410
It may not be as good as the rest of the
videos, because we didn't knew,

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,910
know what we were doing at the time.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,210
But we're still pretty excited about it.

40
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,980
And we think you'll like it.

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,830
>> Yeah.

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,260
I'm It's the start of the journey so its
still very exciting.

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,740
>> Well we'll see you in the cold.

44
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,765
>> Take me to your leader.

45
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,267
