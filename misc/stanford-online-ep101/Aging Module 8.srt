1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,890
Welcome to module eight.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,350
I hope you are all still with me.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,040
I realize this is a long section, but

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,760
there's so much to talk about when it
comes to aging.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,352
Only a couple more module's to go and this
should be a good one for

6
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:12,520
all you athletes out there.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,530
Used to be that when an older adult came
into a sports medicine physician office

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,260
complaining about a problem, the physician
would just tell them to stop competing and

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,050
just take time to rest.

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,810
But they can't do that anymore.

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,500
There's currently a much greater
understanding of the benefits of

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,320
physical activity on the mind and body for
people of all ages.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,610
In addition, there's been an explosion of
participation by masters athletes who

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,820
train for competition or just for fun and
health.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,430
For example, in 1987, there were 500
participants in the World Senior Games,

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,830
which requires people to be over 50.

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,370
That event had grown to 9000 participants
in 2007, and in 2013,

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,380
the national senior games, which draws the
top senior athletes from

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,660
around the country had almost 12,000
athletes.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,740
In those games they had to create an 80+
basketball division, and

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,524
records were falling like dominoes in the
new 100+ age categories.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,140
It's estimated now that 50% of all
endurance athletes competing in the US.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,780
are in their middle age.

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,265
Woo hoo, let's hear it for middle age.

25
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:20,890
[LAUGH] There is no denying that amazing
feats are being accomplished by

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,220
older athletes all the time.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,180
We talked in an earlier module about
Sister Madonna Buder,

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,290
who completed an Ironman at age 82.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,390
In addition we have Olga Kotelko, who is
94 and

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,170
has 700 track and field gold medals and 26
world records.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,860
Her favorite event is the hammer throw.

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,390
There's a link to a very sweet video about
her in the resources section.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,050
There are also a lot of middle age
athletes who are competing on par with

34
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,940
younger athletes in open age categories.

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,870
Dara Torres, winning an Olympic silver
medal in swimming at 41.

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,130
Professional baseball players playing into
their late 40s, and many other examples.

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,800
Having said that though, there's
definitely something going on with aging

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,770
even in people who train as hard as they
possibly can throughout their life.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,600
Exercise is the healthy aging pill, but
it's not magic.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,660
An elite 50 or

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,520
70 year old athlete is not going to
compete like an elite 30 year old athlete.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
So what's normal?

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,770
What is an inevitable decline, and

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,780
is there a point where physical activity
can't compensate anymore for aging?

45
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,560
Well, a good way to answer those questions
is by looking at the changes in

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,390
world record times across the lifespan.

47
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,920
People who, in theory, aren't detraining
from lack of effort.

48
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,260
To my right are two graphs that show the
change in world record times with age.

49
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,590
The top panel is for 10 kilometer running
times for men and women.

50
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,760
You can see that initially, values are
pretty stable: 20s, 30s, 40s pretty flat.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,230
50s, 60s, starting to fall off a bit.

52
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,480
70, 80s, start to get an exponential
increase in the time that

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,210
it takes to finish the 10k.

54
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,470
A similar type of thing happens in the
lower graph, representing the swim world

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,470
record times for men and women in the 500
meter and the 1500 meter.

56
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,700
Values gradually fall off until 70 years
old, when times increase dramatically.

57
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,770
The fall off seems to happen a bit later
in swimming than the running graph,

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,640
probably because of fewer muscular
skeletal injuries in

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,020
swimming compared to running.

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,010
So what does this mean?

61
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,010
It means that exercise is pretty good at
compensating for

62
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,820
aging until around 60 or 70 years old.

63
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,970
This applies to strength events like
Olympic weightlifting as well.

64
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,370
But even in these elite older athletes
it's hard to know what is true biology and

65
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,860
what is behavior.

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,430
For example, also at that time.

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,680
Self chosen walk pace declines in humans.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,590
And it's not just humans.

69
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,300
There's also a reduction in spontaneous
physical activity in

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,780
other species like insects and rodents at
that equivalent age range.

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,510
So maybe it's that masters athletes just
don't want to

72
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,870
push themselves as hard anymore.

73
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,710
It's just not worth it.

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,890
The good news is that, life long activity
seems to

75
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,340
push that decline in spontaneous activity
to an older age, at least in rats.

76
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,950
So why will performance go down even if
you're trying to train as hard as

77
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,970
you did when you were younger?

78
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,170
As we talked about earlier, there are
several reasons.

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,840
First, your maximum heart rate will
decline no matter what.

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,340
So even if you're training hard enough to
keep most other things relatively

81
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,260
constant, cardiac output,

82
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,530
which is the amount of blood pumped from
your heart per minute, will fall.

83
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,570
And we know from the Fick equation
earlier, that the fallen cardiac

84
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,300
output will result in the a lower maximum
capacity of the O2 max.

85
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,870
Muscle mass will be maintained better in
masters athletes than

86
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,040
their sedentary counterparts, but it's
still not possible for

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,910
an older adult to keep the same amount of
muscle as a younger person.

88
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,040
Hormones like testosterone, estrogen,
growth hormone, fall with age, so

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,630
the internal environment is less anabolic
or growth promoting.

90
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,440
Next, reaction time and your speed to
develop peak force declines, so

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,040
younger people beat you off the mark and
to the ball.

92
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,830
Your flexibility declines as well because
little cross bridges start to

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,270
form in your connective tissue, which
tighten up the tendons.

94
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,850
The loss of flexibility can reduce your
economy of movement.

95
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,790
For example, older sprinters take smaller
steps.

96
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,540
Steps.

97
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,770
Both because of reduced power and

98
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,830
reduced joint range of motion, causing him
to slow down.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
Sorry, but things that increase with age
aren't so good either.

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,930
You're more likely to get injured acutely
because connective tissue gets stiffer and

101
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,290
decreases in tensile strength.

102
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,730
Therefore, when you pull on it abruptly,
it's more likely to rupture.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,950
I know this from personal experience
because I had a full rupture of my

104
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,655
Achilles tendon a couple years ago,

105
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:11,340
doing a movement that I had done a 1000
times before.

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,980
It was not a pleasant experience.

107
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,689
But I'm fully recovered now, just in case
you're interested.

108
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,130
Overuse injuries become a bigger problem
as well because A,

109
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,750
you've been using that muscle or tendon or
joint for

110
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,290
many years and B, your repair mechanisms
are not as effective as they used to be.

111
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,470
So small problems that would go away
quickly in a young person linger for

112
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,870
longer and get aggravated masters
athletes.

113
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,820
Talk briefly about why repair mechanisms
are slowed in

114
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,470
older tissue in the next module.

115
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,670
It's fascinating stuff and they're working
on some good solutions.

116
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,920
Anyway, as a result, you need more
recovery time between exercise bouts.

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,640
So even if you really really want to train
as much as when you were 20,

118
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,819
your body probably won't cooperate.

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,950
If you're a masters athlete you can expect
to do really well at any age and

120
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,400
you can expect to be much better off than
your couch potato uncle,

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,810
who only watches sports instead of
participating himself.

122
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,790
But you can't expect to be as fast as you
were 20 years ago.

123
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,910
Estimates vary and individuals can prove
general estimates wrong, but

124
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,325
what I've listed here are just a few
examples of expected rates of decline.

125
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:28,830
For example, although master's Ironman
triathletes have been getting faster in

126
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,435
general over the past 25 years, there's
still a decline in performance of about

127
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:38,905
13% per decade for men, and 15% per decade
in women up to age 70.

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,660
With running over a range of distances,
things remain pretty good

129
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,620
through the 40's, but then start to
decline about 1.7% per year after age 50,

130
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,950
and then more like 7% per year after age
70.

131
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,690
Interestingly, biking performance is
thought to stay more stable than running.

132
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,450
It has to due with the mechanical
advantage of the bike and

133
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,370
the reduction of repetitive loading
injuries.

134
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,990
Also when biking you use mainly concentric
contractions, or shortening contractions,

135
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,270
in contrast, running relies more heavily
than biking on eccentric or

136
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,700
lengthening contractions, which decline
more rapidly with age.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,190
A combination of these factors helps
maintain biking performance into

138
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,870
later years.

139
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,650
Good for all you cyclists out there, eh?

140
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,142
And finally, weightlifting generally
decreases more

141
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:38,417
rapidly than others on the list after age
45.

142
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,610
Let's talk about some special
considerations for masters athletes.

143
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,760
Whereas regular physical activity has
clear benefits on cardiac function.

144
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,030
Those that have underlying cardiac disease
can be of greater risk of

145
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,110
a cardiac incident during unaccustomed or
sudden high intensity exercise.

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,270
In general the benefits greatly outweigh
the risks but

147
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,620
before starting a new exercise program,

148
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,499
it's recommended that masters athletes
have a pre-participation evaluation.

149
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,240
Osteoarthritis is common and can make
movements of the joints painful.

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
Although exercise doesn't cause
osteoarthritis, high impact act,

151
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,010
act, activities can make it worse than if
already exists.

152
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,030
Alternative, lower impact forms of
training may need to

153
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,502
be incorporated in to your routines.

154
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,140
Medications of various kinds can interfere
with performance.

155
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,560
There are too many to get list them all,
but here are a couple of common examples.

156
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,710
Beta blockers, taken to lower heart rate
and blood pressure do just that,

157
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,459
lower heart rate and blood pressure, which
is not good for high intensity activities.

158
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,140
Statins that are very common medication in
the US for high cholesterol may cause

159
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,450
muscle pain, muscle damage and impaired
muscle performance in some athletes.

160
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,430
A review article on this topic is linked
in the resources for those,

161
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,680
for those of that, you that are currently
taking statins.

162
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:01,570
Rather dilators like Calcium channel
blockers can lower blood

163
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,220
pressure too far if exercise is stopped
suddenly.

164
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,950
Next issue is hydration.

165
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,780
Hydration status needs to be monitored
more closely in

166
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,590
masters athletes because they have a less
robust thirst mechanism and

167
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,989
dehydration can interact negatively with
many medications.

168
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,880
Injuries.

169
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,805
In one study,

170
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:27,410
89% of athletes over 50 reported having
injuries of various degrees.

171
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,900
Injury is the most common reason athletes
stop competing, so they will happen, but

172
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,380
most of the time they will heal.

173
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,949
But the injuries can't be ignored, and
they need to be given time to repair.

174
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,390
As a result of the considerations
described, it's wise for masters athletes

175
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,440
to consider a pre-participation screen
evaluation if they are taking medications,

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,060
have an ongoing injury, or have any
disease risk factors.

177
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,820
The last thing on the list is team sports.

178
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,970
Now this is an interesting category
because you're not just competing against

179
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,870
the clock, now you're battling younger
players.

180
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,390
Although it's changing a little bit, it's
rare for

181
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,300
athletes to compete in team sports at
elite levels past 40.

182
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,590
Those athletes that do experience more
contraction induce injuries and

183
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:22,100
are at a greater risk of injuries during
collisions because of less elastic fibers.

184
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,820
Also, with fewer power type II muscle
fibers,

185
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,550
older athletes experience more eccentric,
those lengthening contractions, and

186
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,610
they're overpowered by younger, stronger
athletes.

187
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,320
One way to help with this is to integrate
more plyometric training into

188
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,840
your routine.

189
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,220
Plyometric training involves explosive
movements like jumping down from a box and

190
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,100
then quickly up again.

191
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,710
But work up to it slowly, so no injuries
occur while doing the training.

192
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,170
This slide gives a great example of what
happens in team sports with

193
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,800
older athletes.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,390
For those who don't follow U.S.
basketball, and

195
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,600
I actually include myself in that category
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Charles Barkley and

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,020
Michael Jordan are three very famous
players that remained in

197
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,770
the league until their early 40's.

198
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,310
The graph to my left has two measures
expressed as a percentage of

199
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,109
peak performance.

200
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,840
The line with the solid circles shows the
free-throw percentage for

201
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,395
the three athletes over time.

202
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:28,780
Free-throws are uncontested attempts to
get the ball in the hoop from

203
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,180
a particular spot on the court, so no one
is interfering with the shot.

204
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,820
The graph line for those number is
essentially flat.

205
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,950
However, the open circles show the points
per game that they were able to score.

206
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,610
In this case, points per game falls off
dramatically as they got older.

207
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,730
A reasonable conclusion, therefore, is
that accuracy is not lost but

208
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,780
the ability to shoot when being guarded by
ever younger players falls off by

209
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,010
more than 50%, as it becomes harder for
them to become open.

210
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,659
Dang, those pesky young athletes always
getting in the way.

211
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,010
Based on what we've discussed in this
module,

212
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,140
here are some general recommendations for
training as a master's athlete.

213
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,790
These are not sports specific, but they
can be tailored for

214
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,270
many different activities and individuals.

215
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,400
In the end, you need to do what works for
you and or your coach.

216
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,430
These are just a few things to keep in
mind.

217
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,970
First, working on flexibility becomes more
important with age,

218
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,265
because things really start to tighten up
and we start to lose our range of motion,

219
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,310
that can limit our performance.

220
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,390
Doing slow, lengthening contractions
across joints can

221
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,760
help break up the cross bridges and
connective tissue.

222
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,420
An example of this would be to put your
toes on the edge of

223
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,790
a stair Lift yourself up with both feet on
to your tip toes and

224
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,460
then slowly lower your heel down as far as
it will go.

225
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,960
So with one foot.

226
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,070
Then use both feet to push yourself up to
your toes again, and

227
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,160
then lower yourself down, as far as you
can go, with one foot.

228
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,565
That action is thought to break up cross
bridges and

229
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:05,189
re-align collagen fibers in your Achilles
in a more optimal pattern.

230
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,470
Now keep in mind that too much flexibility
can be bad for performance.

231
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,300
For example, in running, those that are
more flexible are actually less

232
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,870
efficient in their running stride because
they have to overcome all that elasticity.

233
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,100
Trying to find that sweet spot right in
the middle of flexible enough to maintain

234
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,339
range of motion, but not too flexible to
impair performance, can be challenging.

235
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,240
Before an event or training do a sport
specific dynamic warm up that involves

236
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,190
slowly doing the movements of the event,
but through an extended range of motion.

237
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,080
This method of functional stretching will
increase blood flow to

238
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,730
the relevant muscles as well as loosen up
tight tissues.

239
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,830
Avoid traditional static stretches like
sit and reach before an event.

240
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,080
This type of stretching has been shown to
decrease measures of performance like

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,680
vertical jump and power for after an hour
after the stretch.

242
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,620
Some athletes, such as gymnasts require
additional flexibility that is enhanced

243
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,870
with static stretching, but the current
consensus is that most sports don't derive

244
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,159
much benefit in terms of performance or
injury prevention from static stretching.

245
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,440
Aerobic conditioning.

246
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,350
In order to keep your aerobic capacity,

247
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,510
it's important to maintain your high level
training.

248
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,910
As you age, you can train smarter by
cutting your amount of training but

249
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,919
continue with some intensity intervals.

250
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,330
Short bouts of High Intensity Interval
Training for

251
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,570
HIIT, have been shown to sustain aerobic
capacity and

252
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,560
even cause changes in the muscle, like
increased mitochondria that were

253
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,730
traditionally associated with high volume,
low intensity endurance training.

254
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,320
HIIT also recruits your type II muscle
fibers that may not get a lot of

255
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,290
action as you get older.

256
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,500
Use them or lose them baby.

257
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,235
Strength, masters athletes should focus on

258
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:58,755
multi-joint compound movements that build
functional strength.

259
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:02,890
Cross-training will allow higher training
loads while reducing the risk of

260
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,109
repetitive use injuries.

261
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,110
Maintaining core strength can improve
performance and reduce risk of injuries.

262
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,750
Then of course, listen to your body and

263
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,580
give it the recovery and rest time that it
needs.

264
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,230
Remember, your body will not heal as
quickly as it did at age 20.

265
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,890
So your performance will actually better,

266
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,529
if you give yourself the necessary time to
recover.

267
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,890
That's all I have time for right now.

268
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,270
I know that this is probably a popular
topic, so I've included some additional

269
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,765
links and references in the resource
section for your viewing pleasure.

270
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:40,290
Huh, that was a fun trip to Boston.

271
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,999
It's a picture of us in the sculpture on
the MIT campus.

272
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,800
Anyway, congratulations.

273
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,850
You can check off another module.

274
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,380
Next up is a short one on general tips for
healthy aging, but

275
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,520
I might throw in a couple science nuggets
about color restrictions, stem cells, and

276
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,770
new strategies to manipulate aging.

277
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,550
You know, just to make things interesting.
