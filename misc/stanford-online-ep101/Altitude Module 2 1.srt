1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,320
Welcome to the Physiology of Altitude
section.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,290
This is one of my personal favourites.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,300
Both, because I love being in the
mountains and

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,570
because I spent several years doing
High-altitude Physiology research, so

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,900
it's near and dear to my heart.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,680
As I mentioned in the introductory story
video, there are so many fascinating

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,980
things that happen when our bodies are
exposed to a low Oxygen environment.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,170
It's amazing how adaptable we really are.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,850
A fun illustration of this concept comes
from the book,

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,520
Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer, about the
1996 Everest expedition,

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,730
where things went terribly wrong, and many
people lost their lives.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,390
Early on in the book, when the author is
flying to Nepal in the Airbus 300,

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,870
he describes a moment of panic.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,170
He looks out the window and

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,510
sees the unmistakable outline of Mount
Everest, at eye level with the plane.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,400
The wind is howling off the top creating a
long train of ice crystals.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,850
His palms suddenly gets sweaty because he
realizes that if the plane were

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,800
to depressurize at that moment, he would
likely pass out or die.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,360
Yet in six to eight weeks he was planning
to be standing on the top of

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,930
that mountain.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,210
Now he climbed the mountain with
supplemental oxygen, as most people do.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,600
But there are a handful of people who have
been able to climb Mount Everest

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
without supplemental oxygen.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,870
A feat that many people thought was beyond
human capability until it was actually

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,260
accomplished in 1978 by Reinhold Messner
and his climbing partner Peter Habeler.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,140
So through a process of going up a little
bit and then back down and

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,910
then up a little bit higher and back down.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,900
Our bodies slowly acclimatize to allow
spectacular feats of physical performance.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,380
That push the limits of human
capabilities.

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,430
Among other things this section will
explain how our

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,110
bodies adapt to allow such a
accomplishments.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,650
So here are your questions to ponder for

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,530
this section as you go through the
material.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,330
First we will address Corey's questions
from the story video.

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,600
We'll also talk about why we care about
altitude research and

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,910
how we actually study it.

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,360
What are the challenges we face at high
altitude and

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,340
how our bodies adapt to high altitude.

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,690
What are the high altitude illnesses we
need to worry about, and what causes them?

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,570
What are ways to decrease our risk to the
illnesses and

41
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,260
increase performance in altitude?

42
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,800
And finally, how do we train at altitude,
and

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,030
will it help our performance both at
altitude and sea level.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,350
Over to my right is an outline of how the
overall section is laid out.

45
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,640
We will work through the topics that will
help address the questions that you had on

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,290
the previous slide.

47
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,720
There are two parts to Module Two because
it was getting a little long, and

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,510
I wanted to give you at least a mental
break.

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,960
The first part will provide background on
why we care about altitude research and

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,490
how we study it.

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,930
The second part will focus more on

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,110
the challenge our bodies experience at
altitude.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,010
You can also see that in module four we
have a bonus story video for you.

54
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,480
Cory and I and the camera crew went up to
the summit of Pike's Peak to

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,590
illustrate what it was like to start the
climatization process at 14,000 feet.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,300
I have to say that it was particularly fun
to watch our hypoxic camera crew

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,970
weaving about trying to film this video.

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,800
We're going to talk about the challenges
you face at altitude in this module,

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,160
and believe me, there are a lot of them.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,139
High altitude really does provide a strong
systemic stimulus to the body.

61
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,300
The low O2 availability impacts your heart
rate and blood pressure.

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,810
You have cardiovascular and

63
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,650
endocrine changes, falls in performance,
and you could experience symptoms of AMS.

64
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,260
But, if you're an athlete there are good
things that happen too,

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,570
like increased red blood cells and
hematocrit.

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,830
But before we talk about the details,
let's put the information in context.

67
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,530
Why do we even care about altitude
physiology?

68
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,090
As the slide to my right says,

69
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,910
35 million people travel per year to
altitude of greater than 8,000 feet.

70
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,560
They do so for

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,750
a variety of reasons that include
recreation, military service and work.

72
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,130
Populations reside permanently at high
altitudes in the Rocky Mountains of North

73
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,280
and Central America, the Andes of South
America, the East African Highlands and

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,080
the Asian Himalayan Plateau.

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,400
But what you may not realize is that even
if you have

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
not been to the mountains recently, you
may have

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,920
experienced a moderate altitude stimulus
simply by flying in a commercial jet.

78
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,780
You see, it takes a lot of fuel to
pressurize the cabin, so as a compromise

79
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,250
to save on fuel, they only pressurize the
cabin to between five and 8,000 feet.

80
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,260
Therefore on those long international
flights, people feeling they get

81
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,550
feelings of jet lag may actually be having
mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness.

82
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,920
There's also clinical relevance to
studying the body's response to hypoxic

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,120
conditions for example, people with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,280
heart disease, experience varying degrees
of hypoxia.

85
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,990
Fetal development is also on the list
because under normal conditions,

86
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,270
the developing fetus en utero exists in a
hypoxic environment.

87
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,820
Fetal arterial Oxygen tension is about one
quarter of a healthy adult.

88
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,540
So, 25 versus a 100 Torr respectively.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,980
That is equivalent to the blood-Oxygen of
a person on the summit of Mount Everest.

90
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,790
This fork is particularly relevant to
pregnancies in which

91
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,690
hypoxia is exacerbated.

92
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,770
Such as, in foetuses of women who smoke,
have heart or lung disease, or anaemic or

93
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,600
malnourished, or for mothers who engage in
strenuous physical activity or heavy work.

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,790
Some theorize that we are able to adapt so
effectively to high altitude because we

95
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,930
spent the first nine months of our lives
in the hypoctic environment of the womb.

96
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,600
Also on the list, tumor treatments.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,150
Researchers and physicians are working on
depriving tumors of their blood supply and

98
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,020
that's oxygen and nutrients to prevent
further growth.

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,610
Understanding how our tissues respond to
the hypoxic environments is

100
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,270
critical to such advancements.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,310
And finally, because hypoxia is a whole
body stressor,

102
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,260
it helps us understand the integration of
the whole body systems.

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,930
We apply a stress to the system, see how
it responds, and

104
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,040
it gives us a stronger understanding of
basic physiology.

105
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,700
So how do we study humans in high altitude
environments?

106
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,230
There are several ways.

107
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,350
First we can use the high altitude chamber
like the one you

108
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,990
say in the Cory story video at the start
of this section.

109
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,610
The Usariem Chamber provides a hypobaric
hypoxias stimulus.

110
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,300
Meaning it lowers the total pressure in
the chamber to achieve hypoxia.

111
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,580
This type of stimulus is similar to what
happens when you actually are,

112
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,630
travel to the mountains.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,630
Studies that are done in these chambers
are both short term,

114
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,000
like the one we did with Cory, or long
term,

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,610
where participants are asked to stay in
the chamber for days or even weeks.

116
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,870
As we mentioned in the story video, one of
the most famous of

117
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,630
these long-term studies was Operation
Everest 2, which was conducted in 1985.

118
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,970
This study simulated a climb by eight
volunteers to the summit of Mount Everest,

119
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,310
about 29,000 feet over the course of 40
days.

120
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,440
During that time an international group of
23 military and civilian scientists,

121
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,760
conducted a series of experiments at
escalating acclimatization plateaus.

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,660
They collected data to determine the
relative importance of various

123
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,180
physiological, biochemical and
physiological responses to the low oxygen.

124
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,320
Can you imagine volunteering to be trapped
and

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,840
watched 24-7 in a little metal box for 40
days?

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,750
To this day, it remains one of the
landmark studies in

127
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,160
the field from which we obtained a huge
amount of valuable information.

128
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,250
Unfortunately, there are not many of these
chambers around.

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,110
They're expensive and complicated to
build, run, and maintain.

130
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,030
For example, can you envision what would
happen if you flushed a normal toilet in

131
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,420
an altitude chamber, where the plumbing on
the outside was at

132
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,688
a significantly higher pressure than the
plumbing inside?

133
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:33,514
Ka-plooey!

134
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:38,400
Ha [LAUGH] there would be a lot of nasty
stuff on the walls of the chamber.

135
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,099
So many things have to be redesigned
within the chamber.

136
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,630
Hypoxic gas can also be used to mimic
altitude for

137
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,620
both research and training purposes.

138
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,950
The gas can be administered through masks,
tents, cubes, hotels, and

139
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,030
even horses' snouts.

140
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,450
The stimulus in this case is normobaric
hypoxia.

141
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,920
Meaning the pressure remains at ambient
levels but the environment is

142
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,440
made hypoxic by reducing the percentage of
Oxygen in the air.

143
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,560
Although originally considered as being
equivalent to hypobaric hypoxia,

144
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
there are some minor but

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,230
critical differences emerging that will
require further research.

146
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,650
We'll talk about a couple of these later.

147
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,580
But as you can see from the slide, people
use the technology in gyms to train, in

148
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,100
labs to do research, and in the bedroom to
improve subsequent exercise performance.

149
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,660
And finally, there's the real thing.

150
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,440
Now this is the best gig if you can get
it.

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,520
Being able to do fieldwork is a fantastic
way to earn a living.

152
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,940
It allows us also to study participants in
more realistic environments and

153
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,510
for longer periods of time.

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,430
The picture to my right is a view of Pikes
Peak from the lower part of

155
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,490
the road that goes to the top.

156
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,050
There is a Usariem altitude research
station on the top where I've spent man,

157
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,320
many summers studying the acclimatization
process with my co-investigators.

158
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,090
The army dudes, as we fondly call them.

159
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,701
You met Chuck and Steve from that group in
the Usariem chamber story video.

160
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:13,220
Later in this section, you'll get a first
hand view of the research station as

161
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,880
Cory and I head up there for a few days
for the chronic altitude story video.

162
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,590
Before we get started,

163
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,740
I thought I should define some of the
altitude ranges for you.

164
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,300
As you can see to my right, I have the
elevations both in meters and in feet.

165
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,770
I try to give both units through out the
section but I may jump back and

166
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,170
forth a bit.

167
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,140
I also have the conversion down at the
bottom of the slide, so

168
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,600
that will help you crossover to your
preferred units if needed.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,710
Low altitude includes cities like Denver,
when you head up to Colorado spring,

170
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,870
springs you're in the moderate altitude
range.

171
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,670
Also, several stages of the Tour de France
and

172
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,000
Giro d'Italia climb up into that range.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Things really start to get dicey when you
reach the high altitude, and

174
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,890
of course extreme altitude ranges.

175
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,480
These include Pikes Peak and Everest
respectively.

176
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,980
We'll spend most of our time talking about
the impact of high altitude.

177
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,770
That's it for the background information.

178
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,500
Let's take a mini break before we get into
the big question.

179
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,680
Why is it so challenging at altitude?

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,710
Take a moment to stand up, jump around and
then come back for some more.

181
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,210
See you soon.
