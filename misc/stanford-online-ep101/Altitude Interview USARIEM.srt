1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,720
We're here at USARIEM, the U.S.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,140
Army Research Institute of Environmental
Medicine.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,990
And that's right outside Boston and
Natick, Massachusetts.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,150
I have the pleasure of talking right now
with Steve Muza,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,650
who is the Acting Chief of the Thermal
Mountain Medicine Division.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,860
And Chuck Fulco, who is a Researcher
Emeritus.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,080
And between the two of them,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,910
they have over 60 years of high altitude
research experience in this unit.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,230
So they, they know everything there is to
know about research,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,770
altitude research in this facility.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,210
So Steve, starting with you,

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,640
can you tell us a little bit about what
you do at this facility.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
>> Thank you for that introduction.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,330
>> [LAUGH] You're welcome.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,630
>> Everything that you need to know, I
don't know.

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,140
Well, the Army Research Institute of
Environmental Medicine

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,040
is here to understand, research, and

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,030
determine the effects of the environment
and the occupations, occupational work,

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,120
that war fighters do, that soldiers,
sailors, airmen,

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,020
Marines when they conduct both peacetime,
wartime, and training activities.

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,800
Most of the military's activities take
place outdoors.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,580
Therefore, they're exposed to the extreme
environments of heat, cold, high altitude,

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,420
even water immersion.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,120
And our job is to identify what risks
those pose to the war fighter and

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,380
how we can mitigate those risks or reduce
them by either acclimating them

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,790
through physiological processes or
improving their nutrition or

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,610
pharmacological interventions that could
sustain and optimize their performance.

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,450
>> Mm-Hm.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,130
And so do the studies that you do, do they
come from the top down or

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,520
do they come from the field up.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,670
Like, needs in the field that generate the
ideas for the research.

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,910
>> It's actually an interaction of both.

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,900
There are needs that are identified by the
folks in the field.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,480
We call those requirements.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,320
They then send up through their chain of
command, and across through, and

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,960
usually through what we call the Training
and Doctrine Command, TRADOC.

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,850
They, they send those over across to the
acquisition research logistics command,

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,000
and which comes down to us.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,840
>> Mm hm.
>> But,

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,380
we also are required and really, we're
looking for what are the state of the art,

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,290
new emerging technology's knowledge, that
we can leverage to improve performance.

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,230
So I would say, it's a mix.

44
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,810
Maybe 60% in fact may come from us.

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,890
>> Mm hm.
>> Because we see how things are moving

46
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,920
along and where there's potential for
making major leaps and capabilities, and

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,330
then there's those folks who tell us we
got a problem, what can we do about it?

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,090
>> Um-hm.

49
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,560
As a researcher myself,

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,320
I suspect that you have more ideas than
you have time to research.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,210
>> Absolutely.
>> There's a lot of stuff going on.

52
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,080
Great.
>> There, there is.

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,149
And, and we in fact frequently will tell
other people.

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,460
Hey, why don't you try this study.

55
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,940
>> Uh-huh.
>> It's not for us to do everything.

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,520
Part of our job is to know what is already
being done in academic laboratories,

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,470
private laboratories, foundations, bring
that, disseminate that information into

58
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,220
the military but then also say, gee, this
looks like a promising area of research.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,170
We don't have the funding or the
capability to do it.

60
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,320
Why not you, you know.

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,030
>> Uh-huh.
>> You suggest to

62
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,940
somebody else that they do it.

63
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,460
>> Yeah, because you have such a unique
setting here with all these chambers and

64
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,960
devices that you must be well setup to do
things that no one else can do,

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
in the world probably.

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,520
>> Well, we like to think that.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,910
>> [LAUGH]
>> There's several things about,

68
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,040
about the capabilities.

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,017
One, we do have as you just witnessed.

70
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,689
A hyperbaric chamber that's not just a low
pressure chamber but

71
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,361
it's also an environmental chamber in
terms of both the range of

72
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:37,834
temperatures from 25 degrees below
freezing, to 125 degrees above.

73
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,369
Yeah.

74
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,420
you know, humidity's running from 10% to
85%.

75
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,305
We've used that chamber to simulate a
cold, dark, damp submerged, submarine.

76
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,710
>> [LAUGH] That's lovely.

77
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,430
>> We've used that chamber to simulate a
cold,

78
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,400
damp winter day or a hot dry summer day.

79
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,350
In addition, we have water immersion
facilities, we have thermal facilities to

80
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,080
study the war fighter human function in,
in these extreme environments.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,340
We also have a regular basic performance
laboratory.

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,600
We can outfit it with virtually any type
of ogometer,

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
treadmill, cyclergometer, rowing machine.

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,860
We can run a wide range of both
noninvasive and invasive studies.

85
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,410
And then on top of that,

86
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,896
we have our Pike's Peak facility at the
summit of Pike's Peak, Colorado.

87
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:33,549
That we've had the pleasure of working
together at, and 114.

88
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,535
[LAUGH] 114,000 feet!

89
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:39,533
>> 114,000, I'm, I'm really going over the
top there.

90
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,322
>> Yeah.

91
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,334
>> But as you know, we can do,

92
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,650
use that facility to study long duration
acclimatization.

93
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,280
>> Yeah.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,410
Then a lot of your studies have to do with
stressing an individual.

95
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,660
Do you find, you have trouble recruiting
subjects, or

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,020
are people jumping at the opportunity to
participate in these fabulous studies?

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,970
>> We really have not had a problem
recruiting test volunteers.

98
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,020
We recruit from both military and
civilian.

99
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,370
We find that the military are very
interested in knowing and

100
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,859
pushing their limits and understanding
both their own personal performance,

101
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,480
whether it's altitude again heat or cold.

102
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,130
And we find that there's,

103
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,420
there's a population of civilians, who as
we all know, I enjoy the outdoors.

104
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,110
Many people enjoy the outdoors.

105
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,410
We have a rich community,

106
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,910
of academic community here in the Boston
metropolitan area.

107
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,980
Many universities with outdoor clubs, with
athletes who

108
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,980
really want to see what it's like to work
either in a high altitude environment or

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,460
a heat, or a cold environment.

110
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,620
>> Yeah.
>> There's also,

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,440
there's also a deep sense of wanting to do
something for

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,200
their fellow soldiers as well.

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,800
That's what motivates a lot of the
soldiers to put up with a lot of the,

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,700
the ill feelings that you might get.

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,390
>> Uh-huh.
>> In high altitude.

116
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,330
And how difficult it is.

117
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,750
>> Yeah.
>> So.

118
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,540
>> Yeah, speaking of that,

119
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,770
you were involved some time ago, in
operation Everest two.

120
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,250
Which is an amazing study.

121
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,890
>> Yeah.

122
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,870
>> And why don't you tell us a little bit
about that?

123
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,210
because, that must really required some
real dedication on the part of

124
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,710
the subjects.

125
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,810
>> Well, well it was an international
study.

126
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,400
We had probably 50, 60 scientists here
from all over the world.

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,860
And because it was such a unique study.

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,670
Unique being that we were going to
simulate a trek up Mt Everest.

129
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,880
So, we had eight volunteers go in that
chamber for 42 days.

130
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,520
And because of the uniqueness of that
study it seemed like,

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,780
every, every scientist wanted to, to
collect every bit of data, every day.

132
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,340
It was a massive study.

133
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,340
We did everything invasive that you could
imagine.

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,330
We took lots of blood.

135
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,596
We did muscle biopsies.

136
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:36,800
We did Swan-Ganz arterial sticks.

137
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,260
>> And explain what that is.

138
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,810
>> Oh.

139
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,800
We went up through the femoral artery up
into the heart.

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,125
And where we can look at pressures in the
heart.

141
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,230
[INAUDIBLE] pressures and so forth.

142
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,930
To see exactly what happens over a period
of 42 days of a climatization.

143
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,210
We did cardiac output studies, respiratory
studies, sleeping studies.

144
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,470
It was absolutely amazing.

145
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,520
And how did the subject survive that?

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,311
So 42 days, in a little box, being watched
24/7.

147
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:06,300
>> They
>> Must have been challenging.

148
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,450
>> Well, they were specifically recruited
by the principal investigator,

149
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,920
which was Charlie Houston.

150
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,320
So, with the idea that they could get
along with each other.

151
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,280
He went through 65 volunteers, and
actually chose ten.

152
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:23,730
Eight started the study and after 20,000
feet, two dropped out.

153
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,492
And we ended up with six.

154
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:30,170
But they, they seemed to all get along,
they didn't have much time at altitude to

155
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,040
do anything other than participate in
studies.

156
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,180
But it was, it was a great study,
absolutely great study.

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,260
>> So, when you got up to the very high
altitudes, 29,000 feet.

158
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,270
What would happen if an investigator
didn't have the oxygen?

159
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,365
Are there any examples.

160
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,244
>> Well, we actually found out,
unfortunately.

161
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,204
It wasn't quite 29,000 feet, but

162
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,930
we were up at about 27,000 feet, if I
remember correctly.

163
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,320
And we were doing an experiment, and
somebody stepped on

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,080
someone else's oxygen hose and actually
pulled it out of the wall.

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,820
And within about 30 seconds or so, that
investigator was on the floor.

166
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,275
So, we plugged him back in,

167
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:15,290
[LAUGH] and the investigator got up, and
continued his experiment.

168
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,320
>> Now, you guys are some fun loving guys,
are you sure that wasn't intentional?

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,170
Like, let's just see what happens, how
long it takes?

170
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,440
How to hit the floor?

171
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,640
>> No, it would have been to another
investigator if it was intentional.

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,800
>> Yeah [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean that, one of
the things that I learned working with

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,510
both of you on Pike's Peak is that it is,
it is really such a bonding experience.

174
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,100
Because there is so much going on in that
little brief period.

175
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,020
And you're working so hard.

176
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,840
And you're exhausted but

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,770
you're all sort of working as a team
toward this common goal.

178
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,210
And it's, a really rewarding way to do
research, as opposed to,

179
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,650
you know, working in your own little lab,
doing your own thing.

180
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,885
Just to have this team of people, that are
helping each other out, and

181
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,810
investigating such interesting questions.

182
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,656
So, I'm sure, in that situation, where it
was brutal, but

183
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:01,220
you were I'm sure you had some life-long
friendships that were made from that.

184
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,520
>> Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.

185
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,370
>> And many of them stayed here.

186
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,820
With you in the facility, and you've
worked with him for almost 30 years.

187
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,680
For both of you, and that's a pretty
unique experience.

188
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,520
It seems like when people come here, they
stay.

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,380
>> Yep.

190
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,090
>> Because it doesn't get much better than
this.

191
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,170
>> No, it doesn't.

192
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,200
It really doesn't.

193
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,010
>> It was, I have to tell you that going
back to my graduate career program, I was

194
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,550
looking at an interest in high altitude
physiology and environmental physiology.

195
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,700
And originally I wanted to be an Air Force
aerospace physiologist.

196
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,460
>> Mm-Hm.
>> That didn't quite work out,

197
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,180
but I knew of this lab and I, I said this
is a great opportunity and

198
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,310
when I went to look for a job,

199
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,850
I sought out individuals who were here
and, and that was the beginning of it all.

200
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,650
>> Yeah.

201
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,700
>> You know, and 1980,

202
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,380
it's actually 30 years ago this month that
I said yes, I'd come here to this.

203
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,881
>> Uh-huh.

204
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:55,840
>> To this research institute.

205
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,570
>> That's amazing.

206
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,450
>> Mm-hm.
>> So, what's the biggest change, if you

207
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,690
had to pick one change over that period
that you've noticed, over the 30 years.

208
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,378
>> He retired.

209
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:11,110
>> [LAUGH] I would, I would have to say,
and I think it's probably true of all

210
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,930
facilities of, of this type, all research
facilities, that the regulatory.

211
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,308
>> Yeah.
>> [LAUGH] Has changed quite a bit,

212
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:18,400
quite a bit.

213
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,560
I don't know that we could've done
Operation Everest two in,

214
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,970
in these times any more.

215
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,470
>> Mm-hm.

216
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,700
Especially with the very invasive studies
that we've, we had done.

217
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,250
Yeah.
>> And, and

218
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,830
the amount of blood that we took from
those fellas,.

219
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,000
>> Mm-hm.
>> I'm not sure that we

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,620
could do that again.

221
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,040
And that's a direct reflection of the, the
regulatory environment that we're in.

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,720
>> Yeah.
So, what is the next thing,

223
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,210
what are you working on right now, for
this year?

224
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,940
Well this year is really a continuation of
the last several years,

225
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,540
what really came out of the last dozen
years,

226
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,930
was a poor understanding of how bad these
extreme environments are.

227
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,222
And, things have gotten much more
quantitative,

228
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:02,190
it's like we know if you go to high
altitude you slow down.

229
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,350
Chuck showed that in 1998.

230
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,840
He, you know, put together a meta-analysis
and showed how the impact of

231
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,670
altitude affects the ability to perform
certain long duration activities.

232
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,780
But what's really been, and we all know
that,

233
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,790
you go to altitude you get the potential
for acute mountain sickness.

234
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,110
But it's really become more quantitative.

235
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,360
What is the percent?

236
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,185
Much like the, when you look at community
flu models.

237
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:24,815
Mm-hm.

238
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,670
>> You want to know that in this
community,

239
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,680
because it maybe have an elderly
population more of,

240
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,490
more of preschool population, what's the
probability of flu.

241
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,120
>> Mm-hm.
>> Mm-hm.

242
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,050
>> With you know, and how I'm going to
deal with it to mitigate or

243
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,250
minimize it, the same thing that goes with
altitude.

244
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,660
How big of a probability and, and also
risk of altitude sickness is.

245
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,980
>> Mm-hm.
>> If I do a mission for

246
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,460
12 hours at 12,000 feet.

247
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,070
>> And that has some planned personnel so
if 30% are going to be out,

248
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,971
then you need to know that.

249
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,370
>> [CROSSTALK] Or in some cases, they
don't even realize it,

250
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,920
just because you're going to 14,000 feet,
if you're doing it for

251
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,700
only four hours, the chances of there
being acute mountain sickness is rare.

252
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,430
>> Mm-hm.

253
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,230
>> And so now we're producing these
models, these dynamic models that

254
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,580
include both time at altitude, the
altitude, plus a lot of other factors.

255
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,740
We're doing the same with work performance
largely based on the initial models that

256
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,580
Chuck developed, as I said back in the
90s.

257
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,010
An interesting thing is that the math is
proving out what he saw back in 1998.

258
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,270
So, you know, validating [LAUGH] Chuck's
original observation.

259
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,130
>> [LAUGH]
>> so.

260
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,730
>> Told you so.

261
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,180
>> [LAUGH] The area of the climatization,
you know,

262
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,470
we knew that sleep high, you know, climb
high, sleep low.

263
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,650
How many days, how many hours, how fast
should you ascend?

264
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,880
There's been general guidance.

265
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,060
>> Mm-hm.
>> For decades.

266
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,760
In fact, Charlie Houston published some of
the first guidance, particularly for

267
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,400
climbing above 12, 14,000 feet.

268
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,410
But it still was very general, very broad
based.

269
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,080
Now we're actually dev, devised, we
actually have a mathematical model for

270
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,910
altitude acclimatization.

271
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,340
Which will then, you know.

272
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,940
We looked at that as a cost benefit
analysis.

273
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,590
>> Mm hmm.

274
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,470
>> What's the, you know, and much more
quantitative.

275
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,080
Where we're going and then, beyond that,

276
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,520
I think we're moving in the area of more
molecular physiology.

277
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,740
We're really involved now.

278
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,490
We're looking at biomarkers that could be
looked at

279
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,930
to assess an individual's susceptibility.

280
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,350
>> Mm-hm.
>> To both work impairments at altitude,

281
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,010
altitude illness, or even the degree of
acclimatization.

282
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,570
>> Mm-hm.

283
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,820
>> I really think that in a few years, we
may have something as simple as

284
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,950
spit on a stick or pee on a stick, much
like a urine pregnancy test where

285
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,265
she says you are acclimated for either
altitude or heat.

286
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:38,765
Uh-huh.
>> Or you're not.

287
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:39,855
>> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. >> And

288
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:46,270
then that will help leaders and unit
commanders devise ways of identifying

289
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,670
not only the best personnel but, personnel
that maybe need more training.

290
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,262
>> Uh-huh.

291
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,180
>> And, and need more time.

292
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,080
Yeah.

293
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,850
So, besides the gene issues which are now
just emerging about who's susceptible.

294
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,260
You know, you, you two.

295
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,270
You are the guys about acclimatization and
getting adapted.

296
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,410
So, if you were going to recommend
something that someone could do if

297
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,990
they were going to 14,000 feet.

298
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,390
To minimize their risk of AMS.

299
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,051
>> Mm-hm.

300
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,010
>> What would that be?

301
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,470
What do you recommend?

302
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,280
>> Well, it's funny you should ask we, we
did a study not to long ago.

303
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,610
Where we took folks from here, brought
them to the Air Force Academy,

304
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,950
then again we do a lot of collaborations
with outside groups.

305
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,610
We welcome it.

306
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,241
>> Mm-hm.

307
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,560
>> And we were at roughly 7,000 feet.

308
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,380
And we stayed there for six days before we
went up to Pike's Peak.

309
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,610
>> Mm-hm.
>> Of course, previous to that we had,

310
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,890
had other volunteers going directly from
sea level directly up Pike's Peak, so

311
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,860
that was sort of our control group.

312
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,790
And what we found was that acute mountain
sickness with just six days being

313
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,830
at 7,000 feet before 14,000.

314
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,965
Was reduced 70, 80% if I remember
correctly.

315
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:54,872
Uh-hm.

316
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:59,130
>> And perhaps more surprisingly is that
exercise performance was actually

317
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,089
improved by above 40 to 50% as well.

318
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:02,966
>> Uh-hm.

319
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:07,630
>> So it, its, it, it's a great way to go
people don't get sick,

320
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,180
at 7,000 feet are not anything worse than
about a mild headache.

321
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,320
>> Mm-hm.
>> For example.

322
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,560
But yet this tremendous acclimatization
that goes on.

323
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,130
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

324
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,010
that can really benefit people before they
go up to high altitude.

325
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,180
>> But, but not everyone has six days.

326
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,570
Like, if you're an athlete and you have a
job.

327
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,676
>> That, that's right [CROSSTALK]

328
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,482
>> And you want to, you, you going to go
up and climb a mountain.

329
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:26,448
You don't have the six days.

330
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:28,830
So, what are some things people can do in
the short term?

331
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,080
Well, one of the things that we're looking
at this year is that prior to going out to

332
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,205
Pike's Peak we have several groups that
are going to different altitudes for

333
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,520
two days, before they go up to Pike's
Peak.

334
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,560
So we, we know that long term
acclimatization works,

335
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,330
we know that shorter term acclimatization,
six or seven days works very well.

336
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,010
So, now we're looking at two days.

337
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,150
And I think the preliminary data indicate
that it does work.

338
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,310
Doesn't work as well as seven days, but it
certainly, certainly is a benefit.

339
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,390
>> Other things that you can do, is if you
don't have the benefit of acclimization,

340
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,860
this laboratory was one of many back in
the 1970's and 80's

341
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,100
that established diomox or cedazolymyde
for prevention of acute mountain sickness.

342
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,710
>> This lab has also just ten years ago
and jointly with you,

343
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,410
as you recall [LAUGH] Chuck established
the fact that in unacclimatized individual

344
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,380
supplementing, you know, their, their,
their hydration with carbohydrate,

345
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,640
improved their performance acutely at
altitude.

346
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,220
>> Mm-hm.
>> Yep.

347
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,370
>> So, we've been

348
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,580
strongly suggesting that, you know, munch
as you go as a way of

349
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,400
sustaining your physical activity at least
at altitude.

350
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,570
>> Mm-hm.
>> It may not have an impact on

351
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,950
acute mountain sickness, but it certainly
allows you to increase your performance.

352
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,310
I certainly have learned two things.

353
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,130
You know, keep hydrated and keep eating
carbs.

354
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,500
>> Mm-hm.

355
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,670
>> and, and just keep, you know.

356
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,790
You can move out.

357
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,640
So, those are some things that can be
done.

358
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,700
I was going to say that sometimes what you
learned is what doesn't work.

359
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,660
And we've done a number of studies in the
last dozen years where we've

360
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,740
tested what we thought may be beneficial
and

361
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,800
it resolved it in no real substantial
improvement.

362
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,330
We've published work earlier on that Luke
Utrinin's have been,

363
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,910
were thought to be involved in acute
mountain sickness.

364
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:28,000
These were inflammatory in, inflammatory
biochemical processes.

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
When we block them, they didn't, that
didn't prevent acute mountain sickness.

366
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,740
So, that sort of went down the tubes.

367
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,580
>> Antioxidants.

368
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,230
>> Antioxidants, we tested together.

369
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,220
>> Down the tubes.

370
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,040
>> That went down the tubes.

371
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,720
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] At the carbohydrate.

372
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,840
We've looked at the use of these
artificial altitude tents,

373
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,100
these normal baric hypoxic tents, or
altitude tents, or

374
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,110
chambers, that you can purchase
commercially.

375
00:17:53,110 --> 00:18:00,270
They're widely used by some athletes,
they're said to simulate altitude.

376
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,350
We said, okay, let's see if we can use
those here at low altitude, have either

377
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,150
our test volunteers exercise or, or spend
hours in them, or even sleep in them.

378
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,750
>> Uh-huh.

379
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,760
>> And what we found was some very
interesting physiological adaptations that

380
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,040
you would expect within the hypoxia room,
but then when you went to

381
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,930
the actual true altitude environment,
whether in the hyperbaric chamber or

382
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,290
on Pike's Peak, there's little or no
carryover effect.

383
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,390
He essentially had minimal to negligible
acclimatization value.

384
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,030
>> And is that in performance or in acute
mountain sickness?

385
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,840
>> Both.

386
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,430
>> Really.

387
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,080
>> Yeah.
>> And so there's something

388
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,170
about the hypobaria per se,

389
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,350
the low pressure that's impacting that
>> Yes.

390
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,950
Yes.
And that has driven

391
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,240
a whole new area of research.

392
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,130
In your research.

393
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,990
>> Mm-hm.
>> How is hyperbaria, per se you know,

394
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,420
impacting our, our, our, our where is it?

395
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,550
What's the receptor for it?

396
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,670
What's the molecular pathways which are
adapting to the hyperbaria?

397
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,690
And there's some interesting work that's
coming out of that.

398
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,680
Not just from this lab, but other
laboratories,

399
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,580
showing that body fluid regulation is
different between the two environments.

400
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,640
>> Mm-hm.
>> For example.

401
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,490
We are currently looking with jointly with
our college from

402
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,050
Mas General Hospital Neuroscience Group,
we're now currently looking at changes in

403
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,640
cerebral blood flow regulation between the
normal barric and

404
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,271
the hypobarric [INAUDIBLE] environments.

405
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:15,790
>> Hm.
So,

406
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,450
if you were going to put together a list,

407
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,330
I'm going to 14,000 feet tomorrow, don't
bother to get in the altitude tent.

408
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,653
But stay hydrated.

409
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,770
Mm-hm.
>> Have carbohydrates,

410
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,180
maybe back off on the exercise a little
bit on the first couple days.

411
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,700
>> Absolutely.

412
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,590
>> And, and how many days do you need
before you can start going at full,

413
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,310
do you know full intensity?

414
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,194
>> Well, I would add,

415
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:41,376
if you're going straight to 14,000 feet,
probably some moderate dose of, of diamox.

416
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,220
Diamox.
Okay.

417
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,730
>> Especially if you know that you're
susceptible, but

418
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,950
I would think Diamox is probably
beneficial for

419
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,648
anybody above 3,000 meters to 3500 meters
or 14,000 feet.

420
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,874
And you probably want to stay on the
Diamox for two or

421
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:57,478
three days, and you can generally over the
course, if, if you're, you know,

422
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,870
you gotta [INAUDIBLE] look at it, if your
symptoms permit you to increase your

423
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,188
physical activity, increase your physical
activity, increase your physical activity.

424
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:08,209
If you feel the headache coming on and,
and the light headedness and

425
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,500
particularly the nausea.

426
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,220
You need to back off.

427
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,380
It can be adjusted.

428
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,604
>> And does the Diamox impact exercise
performance at all?

429
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:16,370
>> Yup, it can.

430
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,450
These men are, are studied not by us but
ironically, at,

431
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,610
at approximately the same altitude as
Pike's Peak.

432
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,400
>> Mm-hm.

433
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,740
>> When they gave it at sea level and

434
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,500
looked at endurance, there was about a 20
or 25% reduction in endurance performance.

435
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,270
And they took the same folks up to
approximately 14,000 feet.

436
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,335
And they again found about a 14, I'm
sorry, about a 20,

437
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:40,020
25% reduction endurance performance.

438
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,680
So, in some situations and some MOS's in
the Army it's,

439
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,680
it's a wonderful thing in terms of it'll
help a lot of people not to get sick.

440
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,190
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

441
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,770
also it will help them sleep a little bit
better.

442
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,110
>> Mm-hm.
>> Perhaps.

443
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,860
But in terms of exercise performance not
so good.

444
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,540
Nothing, nothing is really as good as, as
natural acclimatization.

445
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,420
>> Yeah.
>> That's, that's the key thing.

446
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,170
>> The one thing that's always confused me
and, and then we can sort of wrap up but

447
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,930
why do you want to hydrate so much when
you go to altitude when one of the first

448
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,221
adaptations that generally occurs is that
you lose your plasma volume.

449
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,470
Well, I would, first of all, I would
caution, say hydrate too much.

450
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,790
I, when we say maintain hydration
depending upon the situation you're in,

451
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,540
remember, you, you you are correct in that
you do

452
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,430
generally urinate out a good chunk of your
body fluid, but there are other ways.

453
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,150
You know, you tend to sweat more and it
evaporates faster at altitude.

454
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,410
You also lose fluid through exhaled air.

455
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,730
But it's really relative to maybe a,

456
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,690
a modest 5 or 10% increase in hydration,
because that's about all you.

457
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,381
>> Mm-hm.

458
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,060
>> Really are losing.

459
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,770
I, I caution that overhydration has, you
know, shown no benefit.

460
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,380
>> Mm-hm.

461
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,260
>> To preventing altitude illness or, or
improving performance.

462
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,390
You need to just maintain adequate
hydration.

463
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,980
Probably 5 or 10% over what you normally
do under the conditions.

464
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,080
so, but, but, but if, you, you, you do,
you're right,

465
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,570
you're going to lose that plasma volume as
you well know, but you do still main,

466
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,580
you need, need to maintain adequate,
adequate tissue hydration.

467
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Also, coupled with the diuresis that comes
with altitude is the bicarbonate loss.

468
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,354
>> Mm-hmm.

469
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:27,870
>> Losing bicarbonate through the kidney
is an important

470
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,640
adaptive function for ventilation.

471
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,150
Because you're basically, as you know,
when you go to altitude you create and,

472
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,030
and hyperventilation, that causes a
respiratory alkolosis,

473
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,150
driving the pH up slightly.

474
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,190
In order for the body to readjust the pH
back down towards normal,

475
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,840
you have to get rid of bicarbonate.

476
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,400
You get rid of bicarbonate largely by,
through the kidney.

477
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,180
And so is not going to leave the kidney if
you don't have enough water to

478
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,850
flush it out.

479
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,350
>> To flush it out.

480
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,660
>> Anything else you'd like to add?

481
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,280
>> No.

482
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,670
>> There's no one single discipline that.

483
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,490
That's right.
>> You know, is appropriate for

484
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,746
a mountain of medicine.

485
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:12,140
I mean, I came from a neurophysiological
discipline of control breathing.

486
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,450
Chuck is an exercise physiologist.

487
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,620
We've worked with people who are metabolic
and endroconologists.

488
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,310
Cardiovascular people.

489
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,100
So, you can come from a wide range of
disciplines and

490
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,270
still make your career mark in mount
medicine or high altitude medicine.

491
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,360
But I, I echo what Chuck said, and that is
especially if you're going to be

492
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,780
doing human studies you've gotta be
willing to get out of the lab.

493
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,670
You've gotta be willing to work, you know,

494
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,440
some cases 24 hours a day
>> Yep.

495
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,170
>> Because once you go into that altitude
environment, you're, you're,

496
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,250
you're typically stuck up in there along
with your test volunteers.

497
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,800
>> Um-hm.
>> That's the other aspect of it,

498
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,270
we get exposed to the same stresses that
we expose our test volunteers to.

499
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,020
And, you know, and, and, and

500
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,010
so unlike many research studies where the
investigator is,

501
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,880
is in a cocoon, you know, or protected
from that, that's not the case.

502
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,670
Yeah.
>> With mountain medicine.

503
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,330
>> No.

504
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,850
That's very true.

505
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,916
>> It makes it exciting, too.

506
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:13,660
>> Yeah.
And, and

507
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,560
further reason why people come all these
different disciplines is because

508
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
hypoxia is such a strong stress.

509
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,170
>> That's right.
>> And impacts so

510
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,480
many systems in the body.

511
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,217
>> Yeah.
Mm-hm.

512
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,618
>> Good.
>> [LAUGH]

513
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:24,118
>> Are.

514
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:24,618
>> Yeah.

515
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:25,118
>> Right.

516
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:26,287
>> It's a powerful stressor.

517
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,478
>> [LAUGH] Yeah.

518
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:28,127
>> Yes, it is.

519
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:29,087
>> [LAUGH] Well,

520
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,787
thank you both so much for your time.

521
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:31,307
>> Well, thank you.
This

522
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,097
really wonderful.

523
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:32,917
It's been a pleasure, Ann.

524
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:33,537
Oh, it's always a pleasure.

525
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:34,137
It really has.
Good to see you.

526
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:34,647
Good to see you

527
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:35,217
also.
I'll see

528
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:35,727
you on the peak

529
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:36,810
>> Yay!
>> Absolutely.

530
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,360
Great.
Thank you.

531
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,460
