1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,660
Thanks for coming back to part two.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,230
Let's move on with our introduction to
aging,.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,860
There's so much good stuff to talk about,
79 years old can look very different.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,950
You can be like Cory, pictured here in the
Agnes suit or worse, in a nursing home,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,248
dependent on others for most of your
activities of daily living.

6
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:21,390
Or you could look more like Bill Caspari,
who you saw in the intro video,

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,160
as a very fast 79 year old sprinter.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,580
Or like Joan Calmay picking up a new sport
at age 85.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,060
Who would you rather be like at age 79?

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,210
Stupid question, right?

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,350
I bring it up because you have control
over which way you go.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,700
There are always exceptions and situations
beyond your control.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,770
There are genetic differences, injuries,
bad luck, and

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,480
some diseases we can't influence.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,020
And there really is no way to stop aging
at this point.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,170
But, the bottom line is that we all have
some control over

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,150
the trajectory our lives will take in
regards to health and aging.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,310
Even small lifestyle changes can make a
big difference in that

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,570
trajectory over time.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,870
Let's look at what we have these days to
manipulate either longevity or

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,350
healthy lifespan.

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,510
Unfortunately, there aren't to many
options right now.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,920
Theres caloric restriction.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,170
This isn't just cutting back on your
sweets.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,196
This is caloric restriction in the range
of 25 to 50% decrement below what

26
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:21,090
would keep you weight stable for life.

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,150
This technique has consistently been shown
in species from worms, to mice,

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,020
to monkeys to affectively reduce the risk
for disease and prolong maximum life span.

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,000
In humans, it's hard to study because we
live so long, but

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,960
there's no reason to think it doesn't work
for us as well.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,860
In fact, there are a group of people out
there doing it right now.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,640
You can probably spot them because they're
hungry and cranky and cold.

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,930
But they're probably also pretty healthy.

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,790
I expect that most people wouldn't think
it's worth it.

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,500
We'll talk a bit more about caloric
restriction in Module nine.

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,980
Genetic and stem cell manipulation.

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,340
We talked about this already in the C
elegans experiment by Cynthia Kenyon.

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,200
Change in particular gene made the worm
live twice as long.

39
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,050
This genetic manipulations to be done in
other animal models as well, but

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,066
it's far more complex in human, and we are
ways off from making this work for us.

41
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:18,080
A more likely possibility, in the short
term, is stem cell manipulation.

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,440
Stem cells can repair and become new
healthy tissues in our bodies, but

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,660
they become less responsive and active as
we age.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,900
Scientists are now working on making old
stem cells behave more

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,390
like young stem cells, but the capacity to
repair tissues more readily.

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,889
There's a lot of exciting, award winning
research going on in this area right now.

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,940
The next option is my personal favorite.

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,070
Drink red wine.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,520
There's a compound they have isolated in
red wine and

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,540
other dark berries called Resveratrol.

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,460
And it seems to have some anti-aging
properties similar to caloric restriction.

52
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,110
One small problem though.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,980
You need a lot of it.

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,920
In fact, if you look at the mice studies,
for their size,

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,600
they were getting the equivalent of
between 50 and 300 glasses per day.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm still giving it a try though.

57
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,230
In fact, I'm about 2 3rds the way through
my 50 glass allotment today.

58
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,410
I'm still feeling pretty good.

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,400
You probably didn't even notice, right?

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,970
Okay, I'm really not drinking that much.

61
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,350
You can actually buy concentrated res,
Resveratrol supplements in the drug store,

62
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,540
but it's unclear, at this point, whether
they actually work.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,610
So that leaves us with lifestyle behaviors
like eating a healthy diet and

64
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,470
regular physical activity.

65
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,480
As an exercise physiologist, I'm a big fan
of this option.

66
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,330
It's hard to separate out aging from
sedentary lifestyle because there's

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,650
a lot of overlap in what happens in
response to the two.

68
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,830
For example, common elements include
sarcopenia, which is muscle wasting or

69
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,160
loss, increased fat mass, and

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,680
atherosclerosis, which is plaque formation
in the arteries.

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,260
WIth aging per se, there's def, there are
definitely things that happen.

72
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,250
You slow down.

73
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,390
You become less resistant to disease and

74
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,080
your body structures become less
resilient.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,680
Underlying a lot of the changes you see
with aging,

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,000
that you have less robust repair
mechanisms.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,880
This gets back to the quote by George
Williams.

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,100
Why can't we just maintain what we already
have?

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,890
Younger people also experience damage to
their body systems at the macro and

80
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,110
micro level, but they're much better and
faster at repairing that damage.

81
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,230
It's almost as if our bodies give up after
a certain point.

82
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,100
Interestingly, new data coming out
suggests that physical activity may even

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,880
enhance the repair mechanisms as we age,
especially in the critical mitochondria,

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,400
which are the powerhouses of the cell that
sustain a lot of damage over time.

85
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,010
There is no doubt that functional
capacity, or your ability to

86
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,910
do physical work, goes down with age
because of a combination of aging and

87
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,830
per se and inactivity.

88
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,850
But most of what people thing of as aging,
slowing down, losing strength,

89
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,780
getting sick, can at least be slowed with
good health behaviors.

90
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,790
The figure to my right is a typical

91
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,100
depiction in the literature of what
happens to physical function with aging.

92
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,538
This particular one was modified from a
paper by Nair, et al from 2004.

93
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:13,080
It suggests that aging leads to muscle
weakness,

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,630
decreased endurance capacity and muscle
wasting.

95
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,690
That, in turn, causes a decrease in
physical activity.

96
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,350
The fall in physical activity then
increases diseases and risk factors such

97
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,830
as high blood pressure, abnormal lipo,
lipids, and type two diabetes.

98
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,510
And finally, those problems can lead to
cardiovascular disease.

99
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,740
Genetics and obesity can play a role in
the process as well.

100
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,710
Wow.

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,290
That seems pretty depressing.

102
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,420
But I actually look at this figure with a
great deal of optimism.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,860
Because right in the middle of the whole
shebang is physical activity.

104
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,520
By reversing that one arrow, you can
reverse all the others.

105
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's take a look.

106
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,340
Here we go.

107
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,460
Flip all those babies the other direction.

108
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,824
With increased phys, physical activity,
you slow the decrement in

109
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,130
muscle weakness and wasting, you increase
endurance capacity and

110
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,950
lower the disease risk factors for type
two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

111
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,180
Because physical activity modulates so
many different systems in your body,

112
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,310
you have control of a powerful way to
impact your aging.

113
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,230
And it doesn't just stop at your body.

114
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,720
Physical activity can improve brain
function as well, through direct and

115
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,300
indirect mechanisms that we will talk
about in a later module.

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,530
We'll look more closely at all of the
individual elements in this figure,

117
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,390
as we move through the upcoming modules.

118
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,810
Hopefully, module two helped lay the
foundation for

119
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,740
the upcoming sections, by discussing why
we age.

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,660
In the upcoming modules, we will focus
more on how we age and

121
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,110
what happens to our bodies, brains, and
functional capacity.

122
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,160
Is it all inevitable?

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,500
Or can we do something about it?

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,460
Let's find out.

125
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,960
See you soon.
