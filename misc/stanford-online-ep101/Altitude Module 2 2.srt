00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,920
Welcome back to the Physiology of
Altitude.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,920
I hope you enjoyed your break.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,300
Let's get right to it.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,710
What is the primary challenge at high
altitude?

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,540
No real surprises here.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,120
The primary physiologic challenge at
altitude is the low oxygen pressure.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,769
But it's what our bodies do in response to
the low oxygen that's so interesting.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,700
As you can see from the numbers on my
right, as you go up an elevation,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,960
the percentage of oxygen in the
surrounding air stays the same at 20.93%.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
But the barometric pressure falls,

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,980
therefore the partial pressure of oxygen
falls too.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,120
If you trace the numbers in the pressure
of Oxygen row on the bottom of the slide,

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,230
you'll see the pressure of oxygen on the
summit of Everest is

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,400
about one third that of sea level.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,090
As the barometric pressure falls, the air
expands to take up a larger volume.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,830
You may have experienced a classic
illustration of this when

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,538
you're in the mountains.

18
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,282
Increased farting?

19
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,730
[LAUGH] The gas in your gut expands and
wants out.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,850
Anyhow, the lower pressure also means that
there are fewer molecules of oxygen and

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,800
air, in a given space, which causes the
temperature to fall.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,290
Typical temperatures can range from well
above 100 degrees Fahrenheit at

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,950
sea level to as low as 76 below zero
Fahrenheit on Mount Everest,

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,870
obviously dependent on time of year,
weather, et cetera.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,090
The falling oxygen pressure is felt
throughout the whole body and

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,720
can greatly affect your physical and
cognitive performance.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,520
On my right is a graph of oxygen transport
cascade for three different elevations.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,450
The graph starts where the previous table
left off,

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,610
at the oxygen pressure of the surrounding
or inspired air.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,320
What happens next?

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,480
The air that you breathe into your lungs,
first mixes with the water vapor and

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,960
the carbon dioxide, coming from
metabolism, that is already in your lungs.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,590
So by the time the, that oxygen gets into
the alveolar spaces, which are the gas

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,180
exchanging areas of the lungs, it is now a
smaller percentage of the total air mix.

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,370
So like with the altitude tents, the
partial pressure of oxygen is less,

36
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,650
because it makes up a smaller portion of
their overall gas.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,724
If you're confused by partial pressures,

38
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,810
that is explained more fully in the
glossary.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,125
Looking at the purple sea level line on
the graph,

40
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:29,370
you can see that the alveolar gas has an
oxygen partial pressure of about 105.

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,800
From there, the gas diffuses into the
arterial blood rather efficiently,

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,790
so there's not much loss of pressure
there.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,150
Gases move from high pressure to low
pressure, and the higher the pressure,

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,020
the more the driving force is to send that
gas to the other compartments.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,620
The arterial blood that circulates around
the body to the tissues where

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,060
the oxygen extract, is extracted as
needed.

47
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,690
Whatever oxygen is not extracted returns
to

48
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,809
the lungs in the mixed venous blood as
illustrated on the graph.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,770
Now look at the blue line, which
represents an altitude of 4300 meters, or

50
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,920
equivalent to Pikes Peak, you can see that
the whole cascade is impacted.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,990
You start lower with the inspired air,
therefore when

52
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,929
the oxygen mixes with the water and the
carbon dioxide, it is again lower.

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,270
You get good transfer still into the
arterial blood, but your levels are so

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,270
much lower to start that there is much
less oxygen available for

55
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,460
your tissues to extract.

56
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,750
When you look at the green Everest line,
it is even flatter,

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,990
meaning there is almost no oxygen
available for your tissues to extract.

58
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,380
We all know that our tissues can't
survive,

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,780
much less exercise, without oxygen.

60
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,160
Here is our friendly Fick equation
describing the components of

61
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,190
the oxygen consumption.

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,980
The volume of oxygen consumed equal the
cardio output, Q, blood pumped

63
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,099
from the heart per minute times the
arterial venus oxygen difference.

64
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,470
With acute exposure, it is the a component
of the equation that is most impacted.

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,356
As the arterial oxygen pressure gets lower
and

66
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:15,410
lower, the a minus v O2 difference
approaches 0.

67
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,020
So that on the summit of Mount Everest,

68
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,150
even if your heart is racing, you can't
get enough oxygen to the tissues.

69
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,090
Without acclimatization, you would die.

70
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,160
The result of this decreasing oxygen
cascade is that your

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,075
maximum work capacity, your VO2 max,
falls.

72
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:38,490
There's some variability, but the general
rule is that VO2 max will fall off 1% for

73
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,850
each 100 meters over 1500 meters.

74
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,240
So on the summit of Pikes Peak,

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,862
that means a falloff in maximum oxygen
consumption of about 27%.

76
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:52,680
On Everest, 75%, which means someone with
a VO2 max of 60,

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,620
which is quite good at sea level, would
fall to less than 15 on Everest.

78
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,570
That is equivalent to walking slowly on
the flat with a light pack.

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,178
Can you imagine trying to climb Everest
with that kind of work capacity?

80
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,750
From descriptions by climbers and
scientific studies from the 60s,

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,020
we know that in order to move in that
situation,

82
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,210
you need to take about six to eight
breaths per step.

83
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,420
And you still need to rest every 20 to 30
yards,

84
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,940
which is why most people use supplemental
oxygen when they climb Everest.

85
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,490
The limited oxygen availability doesn't
just affect maximum performance, but

86
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,710
affects sub-maximum performance as well.

87
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,560
Let's give Corey a hypothetical challenge
at 4500 meters,

88
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,160
where he tries to exercise to maximum and
compare it to sea level.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,011
His VO2 max falls about 30%.

90
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,490
But now, a set task, say riding the bike
at 125 watts, which is depicted

91
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,790
in the red on the graph, represents a
higher percentage of his maximum.

92
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,210
Therefore, everything he does will seem
harder at altitude.

93
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,890
Climbing, making camp, competing in a
cycling event will all be harder and

94
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,490
it won't be able to sustain that same
absolute workload as long at altitude.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,192
Since we spend most of our time performing
sub-maximal tasks,

96
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:17,650
the sub-maximal impact will be more
noticeable decrement in performance.

97
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,030
It is logical that being more fit should
help you do better at altitude.

98
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,960
And it's certainly does in some ways,
requires great strength and

99
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
stamina to climb mountains.

100
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,240
But interestingly, some of the advantage
that fit people have at

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,550
sea level relative to less fit people is
lost at altitude,

102
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,870
because the fall in VO2 max is a
percentage.

103
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,280
So a recreational athlete with a VO2 max
of 45 at

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,580
sea level will drop to about 12 on
Everest.

105
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,730
Similarly, a much fitter guy with a sea
level VO2 max of 60 will drop to 15.

106
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,280
So there's a convergence of these values
at altitude.

107
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,830
Why is that?

108
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,260
It has to do with the concept of transit
time.

109
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,440
Transit time is the amount of time that
blood is in contact with

110
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,810
the exchanging tissues.

111
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,890
In this case, the lungs.

112
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,030
Highly fit people have very high cardiac
outputs,

113
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,110
meaning that their hearts are pumping
larger volumes of blood at

114
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,259
a very rapid rate through the heart and
lungs.

115
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,080
So the blood has less time to fully
saturate with oxygen as it

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,220
passes through the lungs.

117
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,120
Remember how I said earlier that the
higher the gas pressure,

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,700
the greater the driving force of movement
for that gas?

119
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,680
Therefore, at sea level, the high cardiac
output in athletes is less problematic,

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,430
because the gas diffuses into the blood
more rapidly with the higher pressures.

121
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,610
However at altitude, the diffusion rate
slows, so the arterial

122
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,840
oxygen saturation falls as cardiac output
increases at the higher work loads.

123
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,660
Thus, VO2 max declines to a greater extent
in fit versus unfit people.

124
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,010
In summary, more fit equals higher Q
equals lower transit time.

125
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,840
Shorter transit time in fit means less
oxygen in the blood at

126
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,380
higher workloads and greater falloff in
VO2 max.

127
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,310
The bad news is that we are challenged to
perform at altitude,

128
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,150
even if we are highly fit.

129
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,940
However, the good news is that our bodies
respond to

130
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,729
the low oxygen right away to try to help
us cope.

131
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,220
We've spent this last rather extended
module talking about the challenges to

132
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,360
performance at high altitude.

133
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,300
Next we'll move on to what our bodies
actually do about it.

134
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,650
Congratulations.

135
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,950
You survived Module 2.

136
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,860
Take the practice quiz for this module,
and

137
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,760
then go on to Module 3 to learn about the
initial physiologic responses to altitude,

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,490
and see how Corey actually performed in
the chamber relative to what was expected.

139
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,990
Thank you.
