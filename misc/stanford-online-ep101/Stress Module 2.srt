1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,340
Welcome to the Physiology of Stress.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,770
If you're looking for a place to learn
about what science says about stress, and

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,450
for ways to improve your relationship with
stress for

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,960
the better then you're in the right spot.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,600
I feel honored and really excited to talk
to you about such an important topic.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,690
As a matter of fact, how we live with
stress is so

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,150
important that I really believe that this
material has the potential to not

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,610
only improve, but perhaps to really
transform your life.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,530
The truth is, you love stress, you thrive
on stress.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,670
And you wouldn't survive without it.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,728
Stress often gets a bad rap, and make no
mistake, it's for a good reason.

12
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:49,888
But in the right amount, at the right
time, in the right way,

13
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:54,870
stress is a part of what makes our lives
so rich, and makes us feel alive.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,129
Beside me is a road map outlining the
journey we will take together.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,570
After the storytelling video we will
understand the stress response in

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,420
the human body through the lenses of the
heart, brain, hormones, and immune system.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,340
We will gain an appreciation about how, at
its best,

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,400
the stress response prepares our bodies to
deal with life's greatest challenges, and

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,900
at its worst, puts us at risk for chronic
disease and illness.

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,470
This knowledge will allow us to build a
science-based model that guides us, that

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,160
teaches us how to optimize good stress and
reduce bad stress in our own lives.

22
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,730
The final module will be jam packed full
of practical tools that can

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,740
help you to actively develop a better
relationship with stress.

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,218
My own personal goal is to inspire you,

25
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:57,580
to make stress more of your friend, and
less of your enemy.

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,960
I've distilled elements of academic stress
physiology so

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,238
that it's more digestible, and sprinkled
the material with practical tools and

28
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:08,790
information that will be relevant to your
life.

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,830
I genuinely and

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,700
sincerely hope that it can serve you in
your journey of making your life better.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,650
So let's start with Module Two.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,990
You just watched an awesome video story
where Dr. Friedlander launched herself out

33
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,980
of an airplane while we measured what was
happening to her body.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,060
Now it's time to unpack the data and bring
it to life using Dr.

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,160
Friedlander's experience to teach us about
the stress response.

36
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,380
So now we're going to begin our journey
understanding stress.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,600
Each video module in this stress section
will begin with a road map,

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,550
like this one right behind me, giving you
a quick glimpse at where we are headed.

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,910
But you guys can read faster than I can
speak, so

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,229
let's cut to the chase and get to the good
stuff.

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,210
In his lab at Harvard University studying
animals,

42
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,770
Walter B Cannon famously discovered the
stress response.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,520
He found that an amazingly complex network
of nerves worked together to help animals,

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,400
and us humans deal with stressful
situations.

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,430
What Cannon, and many researchers who
followed found, was that there seemed to

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,630
be some sort of coordinated activity in
response to a stressor,

47
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,450
which they called the stress response, or
the ergotropic system.

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,950
Ergotropic, meaning work system,

49
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,730
because these researchers theorized that
the stress response prepared the body

50
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,705
to do something, to do work on the
external world.

51
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:46,830
Scientists also found an additional system
that seemed to

52
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,300
be the opposite of this work system which
they called the trophotropic system,

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,070
a fancy way of describing a growth or a
restorative system.

54
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,740
We will gain a deep understanding of both
of these systems in this section.

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,070
Starting with this work system more
commonly referred to

56
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,210
as the stress response.

57
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,910
So what is stress?

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,100
Walter Cannon, who was a renaissance man,
and a great researcher and athlete,

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,050
described the stress response with a
metaphor that compared the regulation in

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,860
the body, that occurs during stress, to
players on a sports team.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,240
Each player has a separate job that they
have to

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,550
do to keep the team functioning as a
whole.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,610
The goal for the stress team in the body,
he explained, was a fight or

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,370
flight response.

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,550
A preparation of the body to either fight
with, or flee from something dangerous.

66
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,840
The stress response they found was turned
on by the sympathetic nervous system,

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,800
this complex network of nerves.

68
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,240
So being scientists, and doing what they
do,

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
they set out to find out just how
important this network of nerves was.

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,010
And develop surgical techniques to remove
sympathetic nerves

71
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,790
in research animals like cats.

72
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,250
With nerves reaching out to nearly every
major organ in the body,

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,320
it's no surprise that it's often claimed,

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,560
that the sympathetic nervous system is
necessary for survival.

75
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,470
After all, most animals that underwent
these extensive procedures to

76
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,080
remove the sympathetic system actually
died.

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,040
However, once the surgical techniques
became good enough some cats actually did

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,120
survive, but barely.

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,490
They were never really quite the same.

80
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,590
They were no longer chasing mice, and
seemed to be perpetually lounging around.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,250
They were able to live only within the
safety of the lab.

82
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,940
It seems that somehow that this system,
this, this work-stress system

83
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,790
is absolutely crucial for us animals to
survive in the real world.

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
So thanks to the work done by Walter
Cannon and

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,410
countless other researchers, we have come
to a pretty good understanding of

86
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,370
what this work system is and how it
functions in the body.

87
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,860
So let's take a quick step backwards
before we dive into the stress response.

88
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,710
Here we are looking at a bird's eye view
of the nervous system in each of

89
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,890
its various components.

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,420
The nervous system is academically at
least divided into two parts.

91
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,940
The central nervous system which includes
the brain and

92
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,610
the spinal cord, and the peripheral
nervous system which includes all of

93
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,910
those nerves below the neck.

94
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,730
Within the peripheral nervous system we
further distinguish between the somatic

95
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,139
nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system.

96
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,650
Generally speaking you can think of the
somatic system as the nerves that

97
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,940
control the muscles you have voluntary
control over, and

98
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,570
the autonomic nervous system controls
things in your body that more or

99
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,900
less you don't really have to think about,
like your internal organ functioning.

100
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,025
We'll be honing in on the autonomic
nervous system and

101
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:57,910
its two component parts, the sympathetic
system and the parasympathetic system.

102
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,930
The autonomic nervous system is charged
with the task

103
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,390
of managing the internal balance of the
body.

104
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,270
And the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems are often presented

105
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,200
as opposing systems that keep the body in
balance.

106
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,200
When the sympathetic branch of the nervous
system is turned on,

107
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,420
it's called an increase in sympathetic
tone.

108
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,470
And your body mobilizes resources,
prepping access to energy, and

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,320
preparing bile tissues to fight or to
flee.

110
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,160
In contrast, when the parasympathetic
branch of the nervous system is turned on,

111
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,620
it's called an increase in parasympathetic
tone.

112
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,680
And your body turns on the rest and digest
system, which is what it sounds like.

113
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,220
It allows the body to rest, restore, and
prepare for the future.

114
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,190
You've been practicing for

115
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,040
your big music recital or for your big
sporting event for many months.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,180
And the time has finally come for

117
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,010
you to step onto the stage, step onto the
field and perform.

118
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,770
Thousands of eyes are on you.

119
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,880
Everyone you know and care about is there.

120
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,500
You feel nervous, stressed, anxious.

121
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,660
What if you fall apart?

122
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,650
What if your body doesn't remember what to
do?

123
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,430
What, what if you fail?

124
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,050
In these types of moments, you'll have
activated your stress response.

125
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,950
Your heart rate and your breathing rate
goes up.

126
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,610
You start getting goosebumps, your pupils
dilate, and

127
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,060
you start shaking, sweating and you get
tunnel vision.

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,650
The body has set off a cascade of
responses to prepare for the stressor.

129
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,640
Many other things that you can't see are
also happening, like the release of stress

130
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,670
hormones, increase in blood pressure, and
an increase in metabolic rate.

131
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,260
Stress will also turn on your brain
systems in a different way,

132
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,030
increasing access to memories from the
past where you felt the same type of

133
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,410
stressful feeling before.

134
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,070
At the same time that all of these
responses are turning on,

135
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,090
there is a cascade of body functions being
turned off.

136
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,650
The general theme here is that,

137
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,420
whatever isn't absolutely necessary to
deal with the stressor, is turned off.

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,759
In other, more scientific words, systemic
restorative functioning is turned off.

139
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,720
So what does that mean?

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,470
Well digesting food, for example, is
really an energetically costly process.

141
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,420
And being chased by a lion is probably a
bad time to use energy to

142
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,400
break down that food.

143
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,830
Activating the stress response decreases
things like digestion, and

144
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,140
tightens sphincters to decrease your need
to poop or to pee, and

145
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,630
inhibits unnecessary or momentarily
unnecessary functions like sexual arousal.

146
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,100
Slow thought, or energy intensive rational
thought is also inhibited.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,340
But really, stress needs no introduction.

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,720
As a human being, you are already very
familiar with the stress response.

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,790
You've been dealing with stress and how it
feels in your body for your entire life.

150
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,710
Behind me is a road map of where we are
going to head in

151
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,890
the next four mini lectures.

152
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,190
We're going to talk about how each of
these systems plays a major role

153
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,090
in getting you stressed, sprinkling in
some practical tips along the way.

154
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,920
When it's all said and done, you will have
a comprehensive understanding of how

155
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,830
the brain and the systems of the body work
together to create this stress response.

156
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,700
Let's take our deep dive into stress and
see what we find.
