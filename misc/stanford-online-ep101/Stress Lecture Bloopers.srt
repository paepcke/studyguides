Stress one.

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,660
And real quickly, just because I haven't
been in here for a while.

Lights, on.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,880
Overhead lights are on.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,738
The camera's on.

9
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:27,675
[SOUND] Exposure is on.

10
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,987
Sound looks good.

11
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,968
Coordinate is good.

12
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:36,462
Two lights [INAUDIBLE].

13
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,510
Alright, Anne.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,130
Here goes nothing.

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,370
Alright, dance, monkey, dance.

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,930
Are there any boogers in my nose?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,940
Mobilizing energy, inhibiting pain and
leaving, even looking out for

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,490
you, and your best interest.

19
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,782
Let's try this over.

20
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:57,290
[LAUGH] It was almost there.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,720
Flowing.
Okay.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,810
I woke up this morning.

23
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,680
I've got a pimple right here.

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,950
I never get pimples.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,910
I was a little nervous, for today.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,540
>> I can't see it.

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,470
>> You can't see it?

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,895
I was going to touch it up anyway.

29
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:18,111
>> [LAUGH] When the peripheral nervous
system, refurther it.

30
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,454
Hm.
[LAUGH]

31
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:22,300
My mouth is dry.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,376
I need some water, and start over on that
slide.

33
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,239
>> [SOUND] Duh!

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,740
[SOUND] First module is done!

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,560
>> That's awesome!

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,408
That's a keeper.

37
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:40,000
>> [LAUGH] How does it look, Dr.
Friedlander?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,466
>> [LAUGH] Oh, man!

39
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:50,270
Welcome back, to the, physiology, of
stress,

40
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:58,468
today stress gets, hormonal and we're
going to [INAUDIBLE].

41
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,150
[LAUGH] The brain plays a vital role in
the stress response, initiating chemical

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,110
and electrical signals that alert the body
systems to respond appropriately.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,950
It can improve our chances of forming
memories, and also sometimes impair some

44
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,616
of our inabilities to fucktion, to
[LAUGH].

45
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,250
>> That was good.

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,884
>> But It does.
It impairs our ability to [SOUND] Jesus.
