00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,944
I'm so stressed.

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:08,430
[NOISE]
This week, we're halfway through

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,560
the class, it's so stressful and this next
module is on stress.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,950
>> The physiology of stress.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,560
Something that we are all experts on.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,040
>> Yes, and not only the physiology of
stress.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,370
The physiology.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,400
How to calm yourself down in stressful
situations.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,250
>> And how to make stress work for you
instead of against you when you need it.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,470
>> Yes.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,100
>> But before we go toward stress,

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,660
let's take a look backwards at physiology
ageing.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,700
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,790
So we've got a lot of great comments from
people who have really been

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,540
enjoying the ageing.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,830
Section and that's wonderful for us, we
really appreciate it, people have been

17
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,470
talking about how it's changing their life
and they're being motivated to,

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,660
to exercise more and be healthier and
that's wonderful.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,215
We did get a couple comments that people
thought we might be making fun of

20
00:00:56,215 --> 00:01:00,340
ageing with our initial story video when
we had Corey in the Agnes suit and

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,810
we really apologize if we gave that
impression.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,485
We were trying to make.

23
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,160
It light and

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,110
have a positive message about ageing mixed
in with a very serious information.

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,660
And as river coachman said, you know,

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,350
it's one of the great challenges in life
is to bring balance to all things.

27
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,850
So thank you for that river coachman.

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,970
That's very well said.

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,755
And thank you for all your other posts as
well.

30
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:23,960
Mm-hm.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,590
Absolutely.

32
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,320
It's it's always really important to us to

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,720
learn to create some space to get some
feedback from you guys.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,860
We can learn how to teach better and
create a better experience.

35
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,600
And also, at the same time we have to that
some of the, the positive feedback and

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,820
encouragement has really been
heart-warming for us.

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,210
because that's why, really why we're here.

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,318
And so we thought we've give a little
shout out to a couple who have been

39
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:55,570
involved in, in the posts and

40
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:02,500
actively engaging [UNKNOWN] are just a, a
handful of people who have really engaged.

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,821
And really made this experience rich.

42
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:06,050
For us.

43
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,540
>> There are a lot of you out there.

44
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,906
>> [CROSSTALK] Classmates, but that's just
the short list, because there are,

45
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,430
there are so many of you.

46
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,590
And we're grateful to have you here, we're
excited about it.

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,030
>> We're still enjoying the forum so much,
and hearing your discussion points.

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,230
>> Mm-hm.

49
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,750
Absolutely.

50
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,620
>> So we're on to stress.

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,010
Anything else you want to say about
stress?

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,600
>> Physiology of stress, yeah.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,270
>> Big surprise.

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,800
>> It is a big surprise, and so regardless
of whatever surprise comes your way,

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,090
try not to get too stressed out about it.

56
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,830
And we just want you to know that that
there's going to be some changes,

57
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,900
and know that along with those changes the
content of the material

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,860
will continue to be high quality just like
all the previous sections have

59
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,360
been peer-reviewed by multiple experts in
the field.

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,620
The physiology of stress is no different.

61
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,370
And we we really hope that the quality of
the material and the way that

62
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,200
its presented will be presented in such a
way that it really could change your life.

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
>> I hope so.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,370
Stick with it, and see you on the other
side.

65
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,870
>> Ciao.

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,370
>> Take care.
