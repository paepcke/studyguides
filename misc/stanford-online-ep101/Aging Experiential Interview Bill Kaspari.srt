1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,470
Today we are interviewing Bill Kaspari,
who is our expert in aging.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,970
Or I should say our expert in healthy
aging.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,250
Bill is 79 years old, has a running form
and speed that

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,260
would put people decades younger to shame,
and I include myself in that category.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,380
And he's an international sprint
competitor.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,200
He's been active for most of his life, but
didn't start sprinting until age 72.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,740
Recently, he's come in first in the 100
meter and

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,340
second in the 200 meter sprint at the bay
area senior games, and

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,190
he came in third in the 400 meter at the
world championships in Sydney in 2009.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,910
Bill, thank you for

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,470
agreeing to join us today, and share your
wisdom with our students.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,740
>> You're welcome.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,860
>> It's a pleasure to be here today with
you.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,640
>> Thank you.
>> So

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,810
I'm going to start perhaps with a most
obvious question, and that is that

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,130
sprinting seems like a pretty aggressive
sport for someone who's almost 80.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,300
What got you into sprinting, and what
drives you to continue?

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,130
>> I ask myself that same question in
terms of

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,170
sprinting because I didn't have any
background.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,980
I didn't sprint when I was younger,

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,440
I didn't even compete in any kind of team
sports.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,120
What I did do, my dad made me work all the
time, which kept me fit.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,070
And then When I was 14, I started smoking.

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,750
One of the, you know, one of the guys.

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,360
And I told myself, I'll never get hooked
on this, and about 20 years later,

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,630
I was still smoking a cigarette.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,490
And I remember the day well because I was
sitting in front of my TV,

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,199
watching the 1968 Olympics.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,080
And I had a cigarette in one hand and a
beer in the other and

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,020
I'm watching all these outstanding
athletes and I just, I got mad at myself.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,996
And so I put the cigarette out and I
crumpled up the pack and

32
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:48,080
threw' em away and I told myself, okay,
you're going to go down to the track.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,720
I lived by the San Carlos High School
track at the time.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,020
And you're going to go down there every
day for two weeks.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,430
You're going to make yourself run four
laps.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,360
And at the end of that two weeks you can
quit.

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,980
And I did that and I, I never stopped.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,100
And so for the next 37 years or so I did a
lot of trail running and

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,520
a lot of road running, but I always had
this love of the sprints.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,390
I don't know, I don't quite understand it.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,340
So one day I came down to Stanford track
here,

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,810
and I was doing what I thought was kind of
a sprint workout, and

43
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,540
this young lady came flying by me, like,
wow, she was really fast; and

44
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,550
then she stopped me and she said are you
going to be in the senior games?

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,150
I said, me, a senior?

46
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,872
You know?
>> [LAUGH]

47
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,190
>> And.

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,860
And I said, no, I don't know anything
about it and

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,870
she said, well they're having the senior
games in a few weeks and I said, oh,

50
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,740
I'm not, I'm not, you know, anywheres near
that kind of shape.

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,020
She said, no, I was watching you, you, you
look like you're in pretty good shape.

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,930
So I came down and I watched those senior
games.

53
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,710
I got to know a few of the guys, just
talking to people and

54
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,680
it was one of the most relaxed, you know,
competitive ar, atmospheres I'd ever seen.

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,350
And so I came down a couple of days later
to the track again and

56
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,970
there was Joy with all these little kids.

57
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,370
And what she calls her jack rabbits track
team.

58
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,085
>> Mm-hm.

59
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,810
>> So, I went over and I said, do you ever
coach old guys?

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,020
And she said, well, okay.

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,480
And so she started coaching me and I told
her what I want to do.

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,340
That I love sprinting and, that's, you
know, the rest is sort of history.

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,260
>> huh.

64
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,905
>> By the end of that year.

65
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:25,590
So, that was I was 71 at the time, and

66
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,020
right after I turned 72 I went to the
Huntsman's Senior Games.

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,320
Surprised myself, I was 3rd in the 100 and

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,870
4th in the 200 and that was a pretty
competitive meet.

69
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,680
And by the end of that year, I was in
Italy, leading off the 4 by 100, U.S.A.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,800
4 by 100 relay team, and it was just like,
that was a dream come true,

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,670
and it really was.

72
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,870
>> So some people will hear that story,
and think that you have a genetic

73
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,760
predisposition to be an athlete, and that,
you know, they couldn't do the same thing,

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,450
and it wouldn't necessarily have a
positive impact on their health.

75
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,290
Do you agree with that statement?

76
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,980
>> No, not, not, not exactly.

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,450
I mean the, the, there clearly are, some
people that have you know,

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,800
are predisposed to certain diseases and
that sort of thing.

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,710
And you can't expect them to go out and do
some vigorous sport like track and field.

80
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,200
But, what everybody can do is find
something that works for them.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,100
It might be swimming, it may just be going
for

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,040
a walk every evening if you can do that,
you know?

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,130
But it's it's up to the individual to find
something that works for them.

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,000
To me it's, it's, the difficult part is
how you think about it.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,570
And what your mental attitude is about it.

86
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,410
>> And you have other people in you family
who aren't as active and

87
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,599
have had different histories?

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,870
>> Oh boy, I'm may get into trouble for
this one.

89
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,800
I have a younger brother and

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,770
an older brother and my younger brother
started jogging around the same time I did

91
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,340
my older brother just thought it was
ridiculous.

92
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,600
And the years went by and I said some day
we'll find out and my

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,120
older brother ended up having a quadruple
bypass and to his credit he changed.

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,930
You know, he quit the smoking, he starts,
he walks every day, he's a better,

95
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,200
eater than I am now, he's a virtual vegan,
so you know, vegan - vagen [LAUGH].

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,560
And so from a genetic standpoint, you
know,

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,210
we have pretty close to the same genetics.

98
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,880
So I think that's an indication that
there's more to it than just genetics.

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,430
>> Um-hm.
So he started pretty late then,

100
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,140
and have you seen a change in his health
since he's started exercising?

101
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,770
>> Oh, definitely.
He's,

102
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,440
he been, yeah, he's been healthier and you
know, obviously quitting smoking,

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,580
that's not good for you but, just the, I
can, I can tell.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,005
I was just went back to his 80th birthday
a month ago or something and.

105
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:35,490
He's out walking now and he just looks
better and

106
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,140
he, you know, to me, he's just healthier
than I've seen him for a long time.

107
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,611
And its all the change in diet, change in
attitude, and.

108
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:49,430
>> They say its the ultimate healthy aging
pill and it will give you 14 years back.

109
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,170
So someone who is 74 functionally can be
60 years old if

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,049
they have healthy diet and exercise.

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,740
But getting back to your training.

112
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,300
So what's your current training regimen
like?

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,430
So what do you to, to be some of the,

114
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,285
the best sprinter in the world of your age
group?

115
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:08,175
>> Well I'm, I'm trying to get to be one
of the best.

116
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:11,930
[LAUGH] I, I work out regularly.

117
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,292
I do still have Coach Joy as my coach.

118
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,128
And I have her give me work outs,

119
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,930
which typically are maybe two days on the
track sometimes three.

120
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,568
A couple of speed workouts where I'm doing
some really fast stuff.

121
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:30,412
Another day might be some more endurance
training where I'm doing what we

122
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:34,168
call [UNKNOWN] 500, 400, 300 meter kind of
intervals.

123
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,970
On the weekend I'll do like an easy jog.

124
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,420
And then, fill in work, I'll go to the gym
and do some workouts, you know?

125
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,220
Especially if I have like, an injury of
some kind or other.

126
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,720
Then I'll go down to the gym, and get on
the exercise bike, or that sort of thing.

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
But even without I go to the gym anyway
because

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,270
if having a strong core is important and
you know and having it you know.

129
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,020
Your entire body should be fit not just
your legs.

130
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,830
>> And have you found that the strength
training you do in

131
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,510
the gym contributes to other activities of
daily living,

132
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,649
that makes things easier compared to other
people your age?

133
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,740
Yeah I think so especially if you just to
the general public.

134
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,210
Yeah no, the other thing that I do, and
this is a personal thing with me, is.

135
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,300
One of the things that, that I've noticed
as I've gotten older is that

136
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,500
people seen to think that easier is
better.

137
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,150
And they'll go out and

138
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,650
they'll buy this machine to do something
that they could do, you know.

139
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,470
I still, when, if I want to dig a ditch, I
don't go get a machine.

140
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll get out my pick and shovel.

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,860
I still cut up my own firewood and I do
that, because I,

142
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,440
I actually enjoy it, It makes me feel
good, you know.

143
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,930
When I'm finished, I get to go in and have
a cold beer or something.

144
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,529
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] You know.

145
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,350
But it's, it's, that's the attitude part
of it, I think.

146
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:50,850
You know.

147
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,270
Some people just maybe aren't willing to
do that.

148
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,880
I don't know why.

149
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,110
>> Yeah.

150
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,230
And if you cut those things out of your
life, you lose that physical ability and

151
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,670
you sort of watch it deteriorate and it
becomes a rapid slope.

152
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,230
So pushing that envelope and keeping that
intensity up

153
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,470
over time may very effective in
maintaining your functional capacity.

154
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,500
>> Right.

155
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,560
I, I and a lot of people and I hear it all
the time.

156
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,200
They think oh, they'll say well you know I
just turned 65, so I,

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,150
you know, I can't do that anymore.

158
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,330
Well but I know guys that are 80 that are
doing it.

159
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,900
So I don't think the number has anything
to do with it.

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,620
I think it's what you do yourself.

161
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,990
You know I'm just talking about some
fairly simple things like I can't jog to

162
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,500
the corner or something and back.

163
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,430
They just, they just develop bad habits.

164
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,355
[COUGH]

165
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:39,690
>> I know there a lot of people out there
who would like to be as active as you are,

166
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,960
and they just can't get themselves to do
it.

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,340
So they wake up in the morning, they say
today is going to be the day and

168
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,640
another day goes by and they don't do
anything about it.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,570
So, how do you do it?

170
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,465
How do you make yourself stay active,
whether it's chopping wood or

171
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,120
coming to the track.

172
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,990
>> Well, part of it is I know that if I
get in shape and if I

173
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,890
train the way I know I should train, then
I'll do well when I go to a competition.

174
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,680
And, I want to do well, and, and, and that
makes it easier.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,530
It does require a certain amount of self
discipline.

176
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,100
But, but just having a goal, I guess, you
know,

177
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,280
something that you want to accomplish,
make,

178
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,210
you know, I want to do this, so this is
what I have to do to get to my goal.

179
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,870
>> And that goal, that goal can be playing
with your grandchildren, or.

180
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,055
>> It can be anything [CROSSTALK]

181
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:27,090
>> Going on a trip to Europe, something
like that.

182
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,610
>> Exactly, it's, it's finding something
that you enjoy doing.

183
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,670
You know, now a lot of people might say,
well I enjoy watching TV.

184
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,950
Well, so maybe I should say, enjoying
some,

185
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,270
finding something you enjoy doing that's
good for you, that's healthy, you know.

186
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,680
It's okay to watch TV, but you should do
something besides that.

187
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,960
>> Yeah, pick up that tennis racket you
haven't played in a long time.

188
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,870
>> Yeah, sure.
>> And get back out on the court.

189
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,900
I, I, I don't want people to think that
oh, if you don't go out and, and

190
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,890
get involved in some, you know, world
competition or

191
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,930
something, that's no, not many people can
do that.

192
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,860
People can't even afford it, you know,
many people.

193
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,840
But if you just go out and do something
that you find that you enjoy doing,

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,550
that keeps your heart pumping, you know.

195
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,320
One of the things that I had to do that,
nutrition wise,

196
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,380
my wife would give me a piece of apple pie
and

197
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,000
say, wait a minute Bill, I'm going to get
the ice cream.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,420
And I finally told her, I said, wait a
minute.

199
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,350
I'm not allowed to have two desserts at
the same time anymore, you know?

200
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,210
Just the pie and I'll have the ice cream
tomorrow.

201
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,470
>> Mm-hm.

202
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,680
So how has your training changed as you've
gotten older?

203
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,050
Have you had to give up some things?

204
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,150
Have you had to have longer recovery
times?

205
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,430
>> I haven't had to give anything up, but
I definitely have longer recovery times.

206
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,670
You know, and I have to be careful.

207
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,900
I can't, I can't get out there in, in the
heat and beat myself to death.

208
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,471
>> Mm-hm.

209
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,430
>> Because I get lightheaded, that sort of
thing.

210
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,930
But at the same time it's important to

211
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,010
maintain conditioning just because it's
painful, if you get out of shape,

212
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,280
you have to work harder to get back in
shape and I don't like that.

213
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,320
So I try to stay in shape just to, you
know, just to maintain good conditioning.

214
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,730
And earlier you were talking about how you
were forming a relay team with some of

215
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,470
your friends, some of the best sprinters
around, and so what are some of the social

216
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,005
aspects of athletics, and being part of a
team, and playing in the Senior Games?

217
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:22,700
>> That's the best part of it.

218
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,280
I've met some really nice people since
I've been involved in this, I mean,

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,430
just coming down to the track here, or
someplace else.

220
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,970
You run into people like,

221
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,020
you know who have the same kind of common
interest and you become friends with them.

222
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,390
And you find there's some very, very nice
people and, and when I've gone to

223
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,590
some of the, you know lucky enough to go
to a couple of international track meets,

224
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,720
I now have friends there's a guy in
Australia that's regularly emails me and

225
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,940
tells me what he's doing.

226
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,200
He just turned 80.

227
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,390
He's breaking records over there, you
know.

228
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,700
And so, it, you make not just new friends
but

229
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,180
new friends who understand the importance
of being healthy.

230
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,230
>> Mm-hm.
>> And that you can be healthy.

231
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,760
So it's, you know, it's an attitude again.

232
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,136
>> Yeah.

233
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:12,360
And they, we know that exercise increases
cognitive function so it keeps

234
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,170
the brain fresh and keeps people on task
and improves executive task functioning.

235
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,790
Oh, do you feel that that has an impact on
your brain function as well,

236
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,370
what do you do to keep yourself sharp and
alive in daily activities?

237
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,350
>> Probably the most fun thing I do is
spend time with my grand kids.

238
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,030
Spend a lot of time with them, and they
keep me hopping.

239
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,280
I've got in fact result of the track
thing,

240
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,050
is my grand, my older granddaughter who's
12 went out for

241
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,350
track this past season, and I got to help
coach that team, you know?

242
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,750
And that was just a lot of fun, and

243
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,150
I got closer to her, and she kind of
opened up with grandpa.

244
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,930
And that sort of thing.

245
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,580
And the same with the younger her younger
sister and

246
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,720
my other daughter has a little boy that,
we go down the creek.

247
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,190
We hike up and down the cr, we just do
those things.

248
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,820
That I would say, that's, that's the best
thing for, for Grandpa, you know.

249
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,860
But also, I just wrote a book and it's
very stimulating.

250
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,680
I, something that was important to me.

251
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,330
I decided to write a book about it.

252
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,540
And now I'm getting involved in a very
steep learning curve again on not just,

253
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,570
you know, I got it published.

254
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,850
Now I have to figure out how to promote it
and, and get involved in that.

255
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,580
But it does give me something to do every
day that I enjoy.

256
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,150
>> So this was just as in this past year,
when you?

257
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,870
>> Yes, it was just published in April.

258
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,930
>> Wow, congratulations.

259
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,130
>> Yeah, well thank you.

260
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,480
And it's, it's exciting.

261
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,900
And I'm getting a lot of good feedback.

262
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,030
And the result from this particular book
is, is what I was hoping I would get.

263
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,530
You know, I'm starting to hear back from
people.

264
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,030
And I started a website.

265
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,066
You talk about a learning curve.

266
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:40,943
Oh, man.

267
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,500
[LAUGH]

268
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,390
>> But, your grandkids can help with that
as well.

269
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,470
>> Well, I'm sure, yeah.

270
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,130
Well, actually, my oldest boy put it
together and

271
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,820
so, you know, working with him.

272
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,070
And, again, there's another positive.

273
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,460
Just you know, it's better than sitting
around doing nothing.

274
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,030
>> So, what did you do in real life?

275
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,710
What were you doing before you were out
running every day?

276
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,060
For work.

277
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,590
>> Well I'm an engineer in business
background.

278
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,580
You know, electrical engineer.

279
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,130
Did a little graduate work at Stanford
here but never completed it.

280
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,460
And I ended up.

281
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,450
Well, I lost my first son and

282
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,580
I ended up deciding I wanted to get into
the medical product business, and

283
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,139
so I came out with one of the first
automated blood pressure machines.

284
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,610
And set up a company.

285
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,400
Was very lucky to get a couple of people
here to, to, you know,

286
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,060
put up some money for it.

287
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,110
And I really enjoyed going out and

288
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,310
setting up distribution and that sort of
thing.

289
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,470
But again, so now you're traveling, but
you don't want to get out of shape.

290
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,430
I would get up in the morning and try to
find a place to go run if nothing else

291
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,690
they might have a gym in the hotel, just
something to keep me active.

292
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,300
And when I came home, it was the same
thing.

293
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,210
Sure, you're very busy, but there's always
time in the day for, if nothing else,

294
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,860
a ten minute run, you know, you can always
find 10 or 20 minutes.

295
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,180
>> So, if you had one take home message
for

296
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,270
our students, and the students could be
college age students, they could

297
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,300
just be middle aged people, living their
lives, or they could be masters, athletes,

298
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,150
what would you want them to understand
about aging and health, and exercise.

299
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,000
>> I think the biggest thing for me is to
is,

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,030
when I realized that the reason I wanted
to keep doing it was it became enjoyable.

301
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,860
I no longer viewed it as oh I've got to go
out and do this work out.

302
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,680
It was that, boy if I get in shape I'm
going to go to this track meet, and

303
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm going to do well, and I'm going to be
with some good guys you know,

304
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,550
some good people, ladies and guys.

305
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,050
And.

306
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,740
It's turned out that I look forward to it,
like I'm going to the U.S.

307
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,680
Championships, and I know that my friends
are there, and I know we're going to

308
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,960
put together some relays, and we'll go
out, and we'll have a nice dinner.

309
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,300
So that's, it's a fun thing, it can be a
very, very positive thing, and

310
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,340
it requires a positive attitude toward it,
you know you've got to think about it as

311
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,390
something good, not something you have to
do, but as something you like to do.

312
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,280
Do you think you'll ever stop?

313
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,950
>> I hope not.

314
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,770
>> How many more age categories do you get
to jump into?

315
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,570
>> There's no limit.

316
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,760
I am getting close to the next one, where
I get to be the young guy again.

317
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,078
>> So you're saying they're five year
increments.

318
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,100
>> Yeah.
75-79.

319
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,270
Getting close to the, another year, and
then I get to be the young guy again.

320
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,280
And, I already know guys in that age group
that are pretty fast.

321
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,310
You know, and their friends and it's, it's
just something that keeps you going.

322
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,000
And I asked myself, you know,

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,010
is it worth all this workout, and the
answer clearly is yes.

324
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,570
Because if I, if I have to stop once in
awhile, I start feeling kind of sluggish.

325
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,530
I prefer feeling good.

326
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,060
And you do feel good all the time, and you
know, you don't have trouble walking.

327
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,660
One of the, one of the things that I do
now regularly is I do a lot of stretching.

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,156
I was telling Corey earlier this is the
part where I,

329
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,910
where I think of it as thinking old.

330
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,320
For example I was talking to a lady in an
insurance office and

331
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,900
she was telling me how, yeah, she'd backed
her car into this pole a couple of times.

332
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,060
And she said because I, I can't turn she
says.

333
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,270
It's just hard for me to turn.

334
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:30,130
Well, I, I know she wasn't close to my age
and so I said to her, I said well.

335
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,950
You know, every evening I just do this
back twisting.

336
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,830
I said, it takes me five or ten seconds,
that's all.

337
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,460
>> Mm-hm.
>> Just, just a little bit like that, and

338
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,690
she kind of looked at me all,

339
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,980
I don't do that stuff, and all I could
think was, keep backing into the pole.

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,000
[LAUGH] You know, I didn't know what else
to say.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,140
Or you know it's, it's, it's the attitude.

342
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,590
It's, not giving yourself a chance or,

343
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,270
yesterday a friend of mine introduced me a
guy.

344
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,160
Told him I, you know, I'm still sprinting.

345
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
And this guy was really excited.

346
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,810
He said oh, yeah, he, I ran a 9-700, yards
in high school.

347
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,640
I said that's great, you would, why don't
you come out for

348
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,520
track, that's real, that's fast, you know.

349
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,410
You'd, you know, I have to lose 60 or 80
pounds.

350
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,800
I said, well why not?

351
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,430
So he continued to tell me how he did in
high school.

352
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,956
You know, I don't know.

353
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:22,320
Hopefully he'll go home and think about it
and think, maybe I can do that.

354
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,310
That's what I hope happens from your
class.

355
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,780
That people will realize, you know, I can
make myself feel better and

356
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,410
I can enjoy life more.

357
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,630
As a, as a result that not to mention that
you are not going to get diabetes as

358
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,961
easily in all the rest of the health parts
of it.

359
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:37,817
>> Great.

360
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:43,100
So one question going back to the training
what have you learned about your

361
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,990
body being a high end athlete as you are?

362
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,600
>> You have to be smart.

363
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,220
You better you're better in,

364
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,560
in terms of the workouts, you better make
sure you're warmed up, you're stretching.

365
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,080
You know.

366
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,100
And I do a stretching before and after the
workout.

367
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,746
And that sort of thing, and I learned that
from my coach and

368
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,860
from other, you know, competitors.

369
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,950
That's just very important.

370
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:13,250
The other think one incident that happened
was that after running that 400 meters.

371
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,330
I was warming up for the 200 and my legs
started spasming and I found out later

372
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,379
that was due to me not putting the right
kind of nutrients into my body.

373
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,490
You know, I had a blood test and they said
oh you're low on biotin and

374
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,960
you're low on these vitamin B6 and so,
they gave me a better diet, you know,

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,850
eat more vegetables, and that sort of
thing, and

376
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,490
also, you know, eat, go ahead and eat more
meat if you want, you know?

377
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,100
But make sure that you learn how to take
care of your body and

378
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,370
you're smart about it.

379
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,750
You know, how to, how to take care of your
body also.

380
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,990
>> How to read the changes in your body,
>> Yes.

381
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,240
>> So you sense a problem coming up before
it actually turns into something serious.

382
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,820
>> Sure, and the other thing that's hard
for somebody like me is so

383
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,910
you've got a minor injury, but you want to
get to that competition, you got to

384
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,390
listen to your body and say guess what,
you have to stop today, you can't.

385
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,560
If you, if you continue, you're going to
injure yourself worse so, you know,

386
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,840
you, you learn a lot of things like that.

387
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,930
>> I've got news for you, that's not just
older athletes, that's everybody.

388
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,810
It's, it's hard to get off the track, or
wherever, with a, with slight injury.

389
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,840
>> That's right yeah, right, right.

390
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,900
No, I mean, that again to the point is,
people say well yeah you're older so

391
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,690
you're going to get injured.

392
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,680
Well, there's an awful lot of Olympic
athletes that get injured and

393
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,390
have all the same problems, so it's not
just an age thing.

394
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,900
It's all.
It's all attitude.

395
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,860
>> So, how old do you feel?

396
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,513
>> [LAUGH] About 79.

397
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:42,940
[LAUGH] No, it's again it's like I don't
think of it as old.

398
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,540
It's like I like when I started learning,

399
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,080
I learned a couple of European languages,
and they don't say, how old are you?

400
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,310
They say, how many years do you have now?

401
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,920
And I thought that was really interesting.

402
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,790
Again, it's a different way to think about
it, you know?

403
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,310
We think, oh, you're, I'm old now, because
of this or that, and

404
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,200
we put a number on it.

405
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,460
My dad was when he turned 65, he was
designing a power plant in Korea and

406
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,870
they walked up to him on his birthday 65th
and

407
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,040
said sorry John, we have to take you off
the project.

408
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,550
You're too old now.

409
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,110
And he, what do you mean?

410
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,300
Yesterday, I wasn't, today I am.

411
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,840
And it's that, that's,

412
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,540
that's that whole attitude, I think that's
part of what should change in our culture.

413
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,820
Is that attitude that old is, means you
can't do anything anymore.

414
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,680
>> I think that's a perfect place to stop.

415
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,670
Thank you so much.

416
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,280
>> Thank you.
>> For your wisdom and your thoughts.

417
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,060
>> Thank you.

418
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,920
Thank you for giving me an opportunity.
