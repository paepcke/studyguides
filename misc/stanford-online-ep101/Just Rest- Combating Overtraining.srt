1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:07,012
You stay up all night, thinking about how
you should be exercising.

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,080
You obsess.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,260
You can't think about anything else except
how you should be on the field,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,715
in the gym, on the rock wall, on the road.

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:24,710
[SOUND]
Exercise is consuming you.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,690
Or running in circles.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,580
Trying harder and harder, and getting
smaller and

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,230
smaller gains, if any gains at all.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,440
All of a sudden, you start going
backwards, you're getting worse.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,790
You have nightmares late at night about
your decreasing performance.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,715
You start to get sick.

12
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:57,200
You, my friend, are overtraining.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,240
Don't fall asleep to the dangers of
overtraining.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,600
Take a rest day now.
