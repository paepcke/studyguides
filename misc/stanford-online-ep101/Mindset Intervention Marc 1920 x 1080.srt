00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,040
As you go through this class, one thing to
remember is that sometimes,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,630
students might feel unmotivated or
discouraged during an online course.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,620
Sometimes, this is because they believe
that their ability is more or

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,990
less fixed, and can't be changed much.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,840
At other times, people recognize that
abilities and skills can be changed,

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,330
with effort And by figuring out what
learning strategies work.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,180
It seems simple, but when you encounter
challenges in this online course, it could

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,710
help to notice if you are responding with
the attitude that your ability is fixed,

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,780
or the attitude that your skills can
change.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,110
For example,

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,775
you can remind yourself that believing
ability is fixed can hold you back.

12
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:47,040
While believing that abilities are
malleable can motivate you to

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,180
put an effort to focus on how you can
effectively learn and solve problems.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,690
One way you can practice this is by
attempting to answer questions even when

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,940
you don't know the answers or might get
them wrong.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,830
If you think your ability is fixed, it's
embarrassing to be unsuccessful.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,000
But, if you believe your ability is
changeable, then even when you think you

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,770
can't provide right answers, putting in
the effort to brainstorm answers is just

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,020
part of the reflection process, and can
prepare you to learn more later.

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,450
Taking a course online may be a novel
experience for you.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,270
We believe that if you put in the effort
you will get what you

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,940
want out of this course.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,680
And we're excited to see the growth that
you experience along the way.
