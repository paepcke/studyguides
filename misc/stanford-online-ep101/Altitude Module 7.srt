00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,740
Welcome to the Physiology of Altitude
Module 7, Risks, Consequences, and

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,310
Practical Tips.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,380
As the title implies, we have several
different areas to cover, and

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,690
so an outline is more useful for this
particular module.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,470
You can see on my right that we will be
talking about the impact of

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,762
altitude on your cognitive function, and
then the causes and

7
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:22,660
symptoms of altitude-related illnesses.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,520
We will then move on to

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,770
strategies to make your time in the
mountains healthy and happy.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,820
Finally, we will address topics related to
altitude competition and training.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,600
If low oxygen availability impacts your
body so

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,490
profoundly, it only makes sense that it'll
impact your brain as well.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,070
Sure enough, on the right is a summary of
years of research investigating

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,610
the cognitive function deficits that occur
with increasing elevation.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,040
Light sensitivity is the first to be
impaired.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,780
Then visual acuity.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,390
Postural stability, meaning balance.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,160
Cognition, coding, reaction time.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,570
All of these critical functions are
impacted at the time when you are in

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,740
highly risky situations and really need to
be thinking clearly.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,120
For example, when climbing Everest,
impaired cognition makes even simple math

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,200
like how much time do I have left before
my oxygen runs out, nearly impossible.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,090
So you need to be prepared for that and

24
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,020
make as many decisions as possible, prior
to reaching the higher elevations.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,230
Remember, you're not at the top of your
game when you're at the top of a mountain.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,750
There are some other goodies you need to
worry about when heading to high altitude.

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,770
And those include the altitude related
illnesses of acute mountain sickness.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,420
High altitude pulmonary edema and high
altitude cerebral edema.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,360
We will stat with AMS.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,490
On my right are a series of locations of
increasing elevation.

31
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,900
The upper limit of permanent residence is
thought to be around 17,000 feet.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,800
Above that your body can never quite adapt
and you remain in a catabolic state where

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,980
you're essentially breaking yourself down
and getting weaker and sicker.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,430
Apparently, some gold miners in Chile
lived above 19,000 feet for

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,530
about two years in the mid 80s.

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,040
Although they were never officially
studied, John West,

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,810
an altitude researcher, described them as
a little bit blue.

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,110
So that didn't sound very promising.

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,840
Anyway, the symptoms of AMS start as mild
and get worse and worse as you go up.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,170
Risk of AMS is thought to start, for most
people, at around 9,000 feet.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,840
But even at that, even at the elevation of
Denver,

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
some people can experience lightheadedness
and headache.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,610
As you go higher you might experience more
discomfort that includes

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,880
the digestive tract, the lungs and sleep
patterns, then problems breathing,

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,900
anorexia or lack of appetite and G.I.
issues.

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,260
As you approach upper limit of permanent
residence, you may feel weak and

47
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,409
tired and above that you only have limited
time to survive.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's take a look at how many people get
AMS, and

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,100
when it usually develops, to see how big
of a problem it really is.

50
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,920
First of all, it takes about six to 12
hours to kick in.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,020
When I was involved with the Pikes Peak
studies, we used to fly people from

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,740
Stanford out to Colorado, the night before
taking them to the peak.

53
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,295
They would sleep in Colorado Springs in

54
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,850
our apartments breathing supplemental
oxygen.

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,430
So it still felt like they were at sea
level.

56
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,190
Then we'd drive them up the mountain at
5:00 am the next morning when they

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,180
arrived on the peak we would take off
their oxygen masks and

58
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,575
boom sea level to 4300 meters
instantaneously.

59
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:30,140
It's funny because all the participants
would do the same thing.

60
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,730
They take a couple deep breaths [SOUND]
and

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,880
then say, this isn't so bad, I think I'm
going to be okay.

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,220
We'd all nod and say well hope so, and
then 12 hours later quarter of them or

63
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,380
so would be pretty uncomfortable, which
brings us to the percentages,

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,850
above 2500 meters about 25% will
experience AMS.

65
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,540
Between 4500 meters and 5500 meters 50 to
85% will be impacted.

66
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,300
Above 5500 meters pretty much everyone
will have some type of symptoms with

67
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,809
mild and moderate AMS that usually takes
one to three days to resolve.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,380
In our story videos we gave Corey a
questionnaire to monitor his AMS symptoms.

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,730
Of course, in the chamber his exposure was
too short to develop any symptoms.

70
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,790
But, on the peak he did have some minor
symptoms listed on the slide.

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,669
He did pretty well, though.

72
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,800
What are the risk factors for developing
AMS?

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,170
How come some people get it and others
don't?

74
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,210
And are you at risk?

75
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,020
Well, here are the risk factors outlined
by Bartsch & Swenson

76
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,520
in the recent New England Journal of
Medicine article.

77
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,800
First.

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,010
A previous history of AMS.

79
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,240
If you've had it before you are more
likely to get it again because it's

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,430
an indication that you are less able to
buffer the normal brain swelling that

81
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,490
occurs at altitude.

82
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,060
Interestingly younger than 46 is a risk
factor.

83
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,480
This is one of the few physical things
that I know of

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,940
that actually gets better with age.

85
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,410
Maybe it's behavioral, for example
climbing less rapidly and aggressively.

86
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,780
Maybe it's wisdom, making smarter choices.

87
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,790
Or maybe it's physical.

88
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,260
Some have theorized that the slight brain
shrinkage that occurs with

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,210
age allows more room in the skull for the
brain edema that occurs at altitude,

90
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,830
thus reducing pressure on the brain and
reducing symptoms of AMS.

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,410
At this time, the reason is unclear, but
they are still looking for reasons.

92
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,040
History of migraines also disposes people
to AMS.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,840
And as with many things,

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,580
there is thought to be a genetic component
that makes some people more susceptible.

95
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,220
Scientists are doing gene array
experiments to try to

96
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,015
figure out whether they can predict who
will get AMS, but it is not clear-cut.

97
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,110
One test that has been somewhat successful
is the Hypoxic Ventilatory Response.

98
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,980
In this test a person breathes gases of
lower and

99
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,970
lower oxygen levels and their ventilatory
response is measured.

100
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,550
The point at which they start increasing
the ventilation tells us how they

101
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,169
will probably respond at altitude.

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Those people in the upper percentages who
start increasing their

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,120
breathing right away, were probably would
not be as susceptible to AMS at altitude.

104
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,360
Those people are not very responsive to
the low oxygen, will likely do poorly.

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,090
The problem is, that there's this whole
middle range, where most people fall, and

106
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,329
the test is not predictive.

107
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,720
What's next?

108
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,300
Women are more at risk than men.

109
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,830
It is unclear why but women are also more
susceptible to migraines.

110
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,710
So perhaps there's some type of
neurological connection there.

111
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,280
And finally it has been well established
that fitness is not protective.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,900
That is not to say that fitness isn't
important.

113
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,310
Being fitter will definitely help you get
up the mountain, but

114
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,090
it won't protect you from AMS.

115
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,280
There are behavioral risk factors as well.

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,970
Essentially, anything that lowers the
oxygen content of

117
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,520
your blood will increase the risk.

118
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,420
For example, a rapid rate of ascent.

119
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,730
The faster you go, the less time you have
to acclimatize No pre-acclimatization and

120
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,500
early hard exercise can lower arterial
oxygen levels.

121
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,630
In Cory's data, we showed that he dropped
his

122
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,290
saturations into the 60s during that first
day one exercise test.

123
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,380
The cause of AMS related to brain
swelling.

124
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,210
In response to low oxygen, the linings of
the blood vessels release signalling

125
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,170
molecules that cause the blood vessels to
expand within the brain.

126
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,160
The permeability of those vessels and
brain blood pressure also increases,

127
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,550
causing leakage of fluid into the
surrounding tissue.

128
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,490
Brain swelling is a universal response to
altitude.

129
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,460
So it is the degree of swelling, and how
the body deals with that swelling,

130
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,660
that differentiates Someone with AMS.

131
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,080
AMS may be just the lower end of a
continuum that leads to

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,690
a high altitude cerebral edema in the
unfortunate.

133
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,010
High altitude cerebral edema takes your
swollen head to the next step.

134
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,600
The first indication is a headache that
does not respond to typical painkillers.

135
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,020
Other symptoms include, mental confusion,
ataxia, or

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,950
uncoordinated movements, and poor
cognition, cognition decision making.

137
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,990
For example, not making sense, removing
gloves when it's freezing out,

138
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,080
passing up food, taking excessive risks,
etcetera.

139
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,979
If untreated it could very rapidly lead to
unconsciousness and death.

140
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:45,520
High altitude pul, pulmonary edema has a
similar pathology but

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,520
involves the lungs rather than the brain.

142
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,100
Symptoms usually appear between days two
and four of exposure and

143
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,459
are proceeded by pulmonary hypertension
and patchy vasoconstriction in the lungs.

144
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,120
Symptoms are listed on the slide but
coughing, labored breathing, gurgling,

145
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,590
turning blue or cyanosis are classic
indications.

146
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,450
Both HACE and

147
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,500
HAPE occur much less frequently than AMS
but they are much more deadly.

148
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,420
Let's move on to some practical
information.

149
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,060
Perhaps you would like to climb Mt
Kilimanjaro for

150
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,470
your 50th birthday, but you are afraid of
getting altitude illness.

151
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,450
How should you prepare?

152
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,590
First you want to make sure you are in
optimal physical shape, not because it

153
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,600
will protect you from AMS but because it
will help you reach the top successfully.

154
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,150
Independent of illness.

155
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,010
So keep training.

156
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,780
What about the illness part?

157
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,230
If you have some flexibility, consider the
following.

158
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,650
Figure out a way to get some prior
exposure.

159
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,540
Ideally, stay a week between 2,000 and
3,000 meters prior to any higher ascent.

160
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,920
While there, take day hikes to higher
elevations.

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,490
If you can't stay up at altitude,

162
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,720
take intermittent trips above 3000 meters
in the weeks or

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,480
months leading up to the trip .The 3000
meter is start on the slide as a caveat.

164
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Recent research by scientists at Usarum
have shown that normal baric hypoxia

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,290
may not help the acclimatization process
the same way as hyperbaric hypoxia.

166
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,530
This is important for two reasons.

167
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,850
First using altitude tents in your bedroom
is not a good way to prepare for

168
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,040
your climb.

169
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,650
And second, there may be bigger
differences in

170
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,700
the two modalities than we had originally
thought and

171
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,340
more research is needed to determine the
foundation of those differences.

172
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:42,740
Ascent slowly if you want to reduce your
risk of illness.

173
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,400
It is recommended that if you are climbing
above 3,000 meters that you do not exceed

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,110
300 to 500 meters per day and that you
take a rest day every three to four days.

175
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,870
Those two things alone can reduce your
risk of AMS by 50%.

176
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,550
Especially at the beginning take it easy.

177
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,570
As we've discussed,

178
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,250
the higher your intensity the lower your
blood oxygen saturation.

179
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,310
Make sure you are getting enough fluid and

180
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,750
calories especially carbohydrate to match
your higher rate of energy expenditure.

181
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,060
You will be burning extra calories not
just from exercise, but

182
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,380
from the elevated basal metabolic rate
that occurs as altitude as well.

183
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,320
About 200 k cho's per day at 4300 meters.

184
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,470
Also, you can't make new red blood cells
without iron.

185
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,800
So, make sure your ferritin stores are
sufficient.

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,350
Based on your previous experience in the
mountains, and

187
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,930
the prior list in this module, you can
determine whether you're at high risk.

188
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,480
If so consider talking with your physician
about getting Acetazolamide,

189
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,230
brand named Diamox, to start taking before
you go.

190
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,670
Diamox is well established prophylactic
for altitude illness.

191
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,720
There are some minor risks such as tingly
fingers, bad tasting carbonated beverages,

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,280
reduced exercise performance, and nausea.

193
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,630
So it's best to test the drug in dosing at
sea level before you go to

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,890
make sure you can tolerate it.

195
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,770
If your elaborate preparation doesn't work
and

196
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,250
you end up with some degree of altitude
illness, you have several options.

197
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,840
Over the counter pain medications can help
reduce your headache from AMS.

198
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,980
For a temporary fix, you can try breathing
supplemental oxygen,

199
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,940
which could reduce the severity of your
AMS symptoms and

200
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,710
may, in some cases, stop and reverse the
progression of HAPE.

201
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,690
Various drug options that reduce
inflammation, lower blood pressure, or

202
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,960
reduce pulmonary pressure can be taken
either as prevention or treatment.

203
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,350
However without symptom amelioration
Pressurization in

204
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,860
a portable hyperbaric chamber, and descent
as soon as possible is required.

205
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,400
Enough about illnesses.

206
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,280
Let's talk about competition at altitude.

207
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,070
The second bit of practical information is
which track and

208
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,489
field events would be most affected when
competing at moderate altitude?

209
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,070
If you think about it, it makes sense that
those events that are dependent on

210
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,344
oxygen based fuel sources would be most
negatively impacted.

211
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,370
Long distance and

212
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,830
dirt events are the ones that use oxygen
based fuel sources the most.

213
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,190
your oxygen based fuel sources are not the
quickest source of energy.

214
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,440
But they represent a large reserve of
energy within your body that can

215
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,350
sustain you for prolonged events.

216
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,770
In contrast, events that are performed at
high intensities for

217
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,940
a short period of time rely on non
oxidative energy sources.

218
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,710
These events like sprinting, may actually
benefit from the lower air

219
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,420
density altitude which lowers the air
resistance to forward movement.

220
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,440
Throwing events are mixed.

221
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,050
Those events that require air buoyancy
like the discus are negatively impacted.

222
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,620
Whereas those that overcome air resistance
like the shot-put are improved

223
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,309
at altitude.

224
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,060
A great illustration of this difference is
the comparison in results between

225
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,160
the Mexico City Olympics in 1968 versus
the Tokyo Olympics four years earlier.

226
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,430
Runners in all distances shorter than 800
meters did better in Mexico City than in

227
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,600
Tokyo four years earlier.

228
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,390
In contrast, runners in all distances of
1500 meters and

229
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,070
up did worse than in previous Olympics.

230
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,590
In Tokyo.

231
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,010
Mexico City turned out to be a personal
best for many sprinters.

232
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,608
So if you're a sprinter and you want to
break your own record, go up.

233
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:37,550
Practical information three,

234
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,410
does altitude training improve performance
at A, altitude or B, sea level.

235
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,400
The first part is easy.

236
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,230
Yes, unless you stay too high or too long
so that you can't train hard enough and

237
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,760
you start to de-train over time.

238
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,400
The second part is not as easy.

239
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,160
It depends on a lot of factors.

240
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,490
Whose doing it?

241
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,080
How hard you're training?

242
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,980
How high?

243
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,780
How long?

244
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,330
What type?

245
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,335
Et cetera.

246
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,450
Let's explore these mixed results a bit
further.

247
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,110
There are two basic types of altitude
training,

248
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,320
classic which is when you go to a moderate
altitude, stay and train at that altitude.

249
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,040
The US olympic training center in colorado
springs has been using this strategy to

250
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
train its athletes for more than a decade.

251
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,260
The other more recent strategy is the live
high, train low paradigm.

252
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,410
As the name implies, the stimulus is
intermittent.

253
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,930
With sometimes spent living at altitude,
but

254
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,140
with the training under normal sea-level
conditions.

255
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,540
There are certain environments where that
that is possible in the field, but

256
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,564
the usual method for this type of training
is done with altitude tents or chambers.

257
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,830
The ladder strategy is supposed to
overcome some of the drawbacks of

258
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,270
the classic altitude training.

259
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,930
We will discuss in a moment.

260
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,150
Let's talk first about classic altitude
training and

261
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,670
sea level performance, there are some
great things about it,

262
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,500
most people experience and increase in red
blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin Maybe

263
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,790
even an increased vascularization,
although that probably takes too long.

264
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,500
On the other hand, we talked about how
plasma volume,

265
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,600
cardiac output, buffering capacity all
decrease.

266
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:21,230
And the increased blood viscosity that
occurs with the elevated hematocrit,

267
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,620
means that the heart has to work harder to
move the blood around your system.

268
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,280
In fact it can be quite dangerous to
undergo altitude training if you

269
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,030
are then going to be competing in a hot
environment where dehydration is a risk.

270
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,900
On occasion cyclists have died during long
races from cardiac issues that may have

271
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,640
been compounded by excessive blood doping
and dehydration.

272
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,090
And the ugly.

273
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,710
As we talked about before, there is an
increase in relative intensity in

274
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,420
altitude, meaning every sub-maximum work
load feels harder.

275
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,515
Therefore you can't train as hard.

276
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:56,570
Although, some think that the relative
intensity is more important than

277
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,990
the absolute intensity for training, there
are likely some high-end neurological and

278
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,740
metabolic pathways that are not optimally
used.

279
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Overall then, it's kind of a mixed bag.

280
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,010
The good and the bad balance out
differently in different people.

281
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,810
So what about live high, train low?

282
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,750
Well, this method overcomes some of the
drawbacks of classic training.

283
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,740
You can train at your normal intensity,
and

284
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,250
there will be less of a negative response
in plasma volume because you

285
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,759
spend some of every day in a normoxic
state.

286
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,970
The bad part is it is not nearly as strong
of a stimulus.

287
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,220
Much debate still exists on how long of an
exposure is needed to be effective.

288
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,510
Although there is a great deal of
variability in noise and

289
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,260
the data, a recent meta analysis suggests
that approximately nine and

290
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,600
a half hours per day, and between 2500 and

291
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,290
3500 meters For at least two weeks, is
required for Optimal performance benefit.

292
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,410
However, it should also be noted, that a
followup commentary on that same paper.

293
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,970
Suggested that a far greater exposure is
needed on the order of 20 hours per day,

294
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,789
at 2,000 to 2,500 meters for no less than
28 days.

295
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,770
Links to both of those papers are provided
in the glossaries and

296
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,190
resource section, if you'd like to read
more details on that topic.

297
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,500
As you can tell from the last few
sentences on the previous slide,

298
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,000
the debate on altitude training continues
after decades of study.

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,330
And it's not just how much exposure is
needed, but whether it works at all.

300
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,690
Some argue that any improvement that is
seen in response to

301
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,540
altitude training is actually a placebo or
training camp affect.

302
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,860
The studies pick these athletes,

303
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,090
put them in a very motivating, isolated
camps with expert trainers and

304
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,390
of course they're going to do better when
they come back down.

305
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,610
Only one study thus far has actually been
controlled with

306
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,360
a comparable sea level training camp.

307
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,840
But, even that control is not enough to
resolve that issue.

308
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,110
Because, just believing it works, ie, the
placebo effect, may be enough.

309
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,200
Another thing to consider though,

310
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,670
is that many studies don't show us
statistically significant improvement.

311
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,710
But sports performance does not rely on
statistics.

312
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,474
The difference between a gold medal and an
also ran may only be 0.5%,

313
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:24,940
a concept known as the smallest worthwhile
change.

314
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,600
The problem is when looking at differences
that small, there's a lot of noise in

315
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,679
the data collection so it's hard to make
any definitive statement.

316
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,430
One consistent thing that comes up is all
the papers,

317
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,630
in all the papers is individual
variability.

318
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,540
In every study, some people do better,
some people do worse.

319
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,650
And, some people stay the same.

320
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,260
When I asked the Stanford athletes in my
class who've gone to an Olympic training

321
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,220
center, whether they thought it worked for
them, I'd get answers across the board.

322
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,710
It may be that those people who have a
strong EPO response, and

323
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,190
that's an increase in red blood cells,
benefit and the others do not.

324
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,620
Whatever the mechanism, physiologic,
placebo or

325
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,200
other, if it works for you, go for it.

We hope you enjoyed this high-altitude
section and

327
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,450
found the information useful and relevant.

328
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,260
Remember, treat the mountains with respect
because they are a powerful force to

329
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,030
be reckoned with.

330
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,610
And we didn't even talk about the extreme
weather and variable conditions.

331
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,190
Be careful out there.

332
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,690
Thank you.
