1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,660
>> We need oxygen.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:08,350
The oxygen levels achieved are in the
range of

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,650
20 to 30% of what they would be at sea
level.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,130
And are way below that which would ever be
tolerated by any doc

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,880
in any emergency room, sitting and seeing
those numbers.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,135
They're truly frightening.

7
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:28,230
>> Dr. Stephen Ruoss is the Clinical Chief
of Pulmonary and

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,370
Critical Care Medicine Division and the
Medical Director of

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,280
the Transfer Center and Respiratory Care
Services at Stanford Medical Center.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,830
His research primarily focuses on the
optimal diagnosis and

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,599
treatment of lung-related infections.

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,190
However impressive his achievements are as
a physician, Dr. Rouss' expertise and

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,575
experience isn't limited to just the
hospital.

14
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:53,910
Dr. Rouss is an avid and accomplished
mountaineer with

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,660
a climbing career that has included
multiple expeditions to the Himalaya's.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,765
Among the Halee-,

17
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:04,670
Himalayan climbing experiences was an
expedition to Mount Everest in 1988.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,090
Which included as another member of the
team the first American woman to

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,900
summit on Everest.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,470
His medical expertise and mountain
adventures have brought him in direct

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,038
contact with some of the most severe
environmental stressors in the world.

22
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:21,520
For those reasons and many others it's a
great pleasure to now turn to our

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,170
experiential interviewee in altitude
physiology, Doctor Stephen Ruoss.

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,850
Thank you for agreeing to talk with us.

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,160
>> And thanks Ann, it's good to be here.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,520
>> So, how did you first get involved in
mountaineering and

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,290
did you always have Everest as a goal in
sight?

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,490
>> The Everest thing was only a much later
evolved aspect, but

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,850
as a kid growing up outside of Seattle the
mountains were close and

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,560
my family was very outdoor oriented.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,500
And although my mother cringed about it
later, part of the original exposure was,

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,300
and this would not be an invite invitation
for parents to do it now.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,240
But they would, my parents, would take my
two younger brothers and

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,600
I out into the Cascades and drop us off on
a Friday afternoon or

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,450
evening and come get us on a Sunday
afternoon.

36
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,350
And I was probably 13 at the time and they
were a year and

37
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,760
a half and three years younger.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,510
So we were, sort of, thrown into the
wilds, not quite like wolves.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,850
But it was, hiking became, oh, I want to
be up there,

40
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,040
became a growing interest in climbing and
I collected myself,

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,340
friends who are climbers and off went my
climbing experience.

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,790
So I've been doing it for a while.

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,500
>> That's amazing.

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,910
Did you look forward to those experiences
where you're just left in the woods, or

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,440
was it something you kind of dreaded and
had to look out for your younger brothers?

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,420
>> Oh, no, no, no, it was, it was the, the
sort of

47
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,270
wonderful thing of the wide-eyed kid
getting to know the mountains and

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,240
getting to know being out in the
wilderness, which is really one of

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,330
those sort of enduring great qualities
about doing this stuff even now.

50
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,360
It's just fun to be out there.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
And it wasn't anything that was
uncomfortable or threatening about it,

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,170
which was a great initial introduction to
being in the mountains.

53
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,620
I had more na-, na-, enough opportunity to
get scared later.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,250
But for initial exposure, it was
wonderful.

55
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,450
It's fine.

56
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,238
>> So, in 1988 you were on expedition that
had Stacey Allison on it,

57
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,660
who was the first American women to summit
Everest.

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,570
How did you get involved in that
expedition?

59
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,780
>> That was also a little bit of
serendipity much like growing up in

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,470
Seattle was serendipity.

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,840
I had been on a number of climbing trips
in a variety of places and happened to be

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,650
on a separate climbing expedition in Nepal
and ran into some Seattle

63
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,290
climbing buddies on a trail up in the
Khumbu region which neighbors Everest.

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,680
They on a different expedition and I and

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,740
another climbing buddy were on a small
expedition to do first ascent on a peak.

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,840
And we ended up in a tea house chatting
about climbing projects.

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,580
And, they thought that it'd be fun to have
me along and

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,050
invited me and, there it, evolved.

69
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,820
And it was, then a collection of people,
largely from Seattle.

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,480
But, a group of friends, and it assembled
itself really as a nice group effort.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,830
And it was in contrast to what oftentimes
happens on Everest now.

72
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,300
A very grass roots sort of thing.

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,140
There was no commercial enterprise to it
at all.

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,240
And it was, it turns out, not only fun,
but relatively inexpensive.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,220
Certainly by today's comparisons with
these commercial trips,

76
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,030
those are big tens of thousands of
dollars.

77
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,400
And I think I was out of it, maybe $2,500
out of pocket.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,440
>> So, it's obviously the highest mountain
around.

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,850
So you were going to be higher than you'd
ever been before.

80
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,560
So how did you prepare for this particular
trip?

81
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,090
And, being a physician and

82
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,630
a pulmonologist, did that impact how you
prepared for that trip?

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,870
>> It did, but it's probably worth, as I
did,

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,110
reflecting on my track record which had
been a climber growing up and

85
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,080
doing progressive climbing activities and
including at higher elevation.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,250
And only later became a physician, so

87
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,490
the fact that I was a doc was sort of an
incidental feature.

88
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,530
I was asked to come along as a climber.

89
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:40,690
And just happened to be a physician at the
time and a pulmonary physician at that.

90
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,470
So my perspective was, knowing a lot about
all those funny things that

91
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,950
happen to you when you're on big
mountains.

92
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,120
And now sort of introduced to the, the
physiology and the revelations about

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,572
what's truly going on as these intricate
and quite remarkable adaptation responses.

94
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:06,140
And it helped, I think, for perspective of
knowing what was going on,

95
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:13,180
but it was still, as it had been before,
an incredible experience to,

96
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,200
to be in a situation where it's so
marginal as a physiologic exposure.

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
>> Mm-hm.
>> I don't think there's,

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,890
I mean, knowing a lot about the medicine,
I don't think would really prepare me

99
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,360
any better than simply trooping up a bunch
of mountains to get that exposure, but.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,090
>> Yeah, except maybe on the treatment
side.

101
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,940
So knowing what medications could
[CROSSTALK].

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,320
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

103
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,190
>> Yeah.
>> Treating problems when they arose?

104
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,950
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, it was.

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,015
>> Definitely.
>> It was much nicer to be a doc.

106
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,304
>> [LAUGH] And have, have instant
familiarity with a lot of those concepts.

107
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,450
>> Yeah.

108
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,326
>> When people got sick, and indeed they
did knowing how to,

109
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,270
how to manage those sorts of things and

110
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,450
how to anticipate what might happen and
keep it all sorted out.

111
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,080
Yeah, it was, it was very handy and I'm
sure, sorry,

112
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,670
I know our expedition benefited from
having a doc along and

113
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,840
multiple other expeditions who were on
Everest at the time definitely did.

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,880
>> Sure.

115
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,610
So, let's talk a little bit about the
process once you get to Nepal and

116
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,110
you're preparing to go up the mountain and
you are acclimatizing your body as

117
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,850
you move up the mountain up to that fourth
camp.

118
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,130
What do you do and how do you go through
that process?

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:33,300
>> It's, it's a lot of what, what ends up
being some degree of drudgery.

120
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,100
And those who aren't climbers oftentimes
find

121
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,870
themselves saying to people who are
climbers, how can you do that?

122
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,670
That is such a slog.

123
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,230
Why do you put yourself through all of
that?

124
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,510
Because the all of that,

125
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,170
is really progressive, sometimes
sequentially up and down.

126
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:01,680
But progressive exposure to and slow
adaptation to that greater

127
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,120
elevation and lower barometric pressure
and lower net oxygen level.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,820
And the time span for

129
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,680
that exposure, and adaptation, is days
becoming a couple of weeks.

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,385
To do it faster invites all sorts of messy
circumstances and bad physiology.

131
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,620
>> Mm-hm.

132
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,892
So, it's a long period of time,

133
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,810
were you you ready to get off the mountain
by the time you actually get to the fourth

134
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,440
camp, or you just so excited to be up that
high?

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,980
>> It, it's always fun.

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,457
It's just even the, even the hauling loads
and setting up camps and

137
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:36,990
getting back down and hauling some more
gear up.

138
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,610
It's an amazing place to be.

139
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,360
And whether it's Everest or

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,910
somewhere else, the, the, the tasks are
actually part of the entertainment.

141
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,720
So, humping a big load up a hill is, it
always seems like a task and

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,800
indeed it is, but sometimes they're
exquisitely pretty hills and

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,908
the view off of those hills is amazing.

144
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,863
So, it's, it's never,

145
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:06,570
it's never quite like emptying your
garage, I'd have to say.

146
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,240
>> [LAUGH] It's not that kind of task.

147
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,380
So, in your case, in your expedition, when
you got up to that fourth camp, and

148
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,460
you were preparing to ascend to the
summit,

149
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,960
your team had to make some very difficult
decisions.

150
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,100
Can you talk a little bit about that?

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,040
>> Yeah, the, a little bit of back drop
which is that the,

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,020
in the usual organization and logistics of
climbing Everest.

153
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,480
That fourth and last camp is that, is that
a pass between,

154
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,780
let's say the neighboring and also quite
high peak and Everest and

155
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,164
that passage is about 26,000 feet.

156
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:54,770
So, we hauled loads to that pass without
using supplementary oxygen.

157
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:01,180
And then used supplementary oxygen above
that 20,000, 26,000 foot pass.

158
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,950
It's not always done, Everest has of
course,

159
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,040
been climbed without supplementary oxygen.

160
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,930
A lot of people still use supplementary
oxygen.

161
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:16,140
So, some of it was simply to get to that
point and get sufficient material,

162
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,730
tents and logistical support to then,
climb up higher.

163
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,310
And by that point we sorted ourselves out

164
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,750
into groups of people who were climbing
together and in rotation.

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,100
And it then turned out that I and

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,770
two other American climbers, including
Stacey Allison and

167
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,130
the climbing leader Jim Frush, were then
in position to climb up to the summit.

168
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,420
Which indeed we tried to do, and got high
on

169
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,700
the mountain to around 27,000, just short
of 28,000 feet.

170
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,600
And Sherpa's who were with us, who we'd
split up the loads with and who

171
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,830
had some spare oxygen bottles, they became
concerned, never having been up there.

172
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,470
And fearful of the environment and the
unknown, and with their uncertainty,

173
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,840
they without discussion with us, up and
bolted, they were well below us.

174
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,400
And what they didn't do was,

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,970
explain that they wanted to go down, they
just turned and left.

176
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,090
The other thing they didn't do was drop
their load, which included oxygen bottles.

177
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,550
They took it all with them and went down.

178
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,719
So then there were, we three U.S. climbers
and one other Sherpa who had been with us.

179
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,230
And we had a single other spare oxygen
bottle,

180
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,750
and we had to then determine who would get
that oxygen bottle.

181
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,840
And we held a lottery and I've never been
particularly good at winning lotteries and

182
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,590
Stacey won the the short straw, as it
were.

183
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,290
And continued on to the summit with the
Sherpa and

184
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,450
that single spare oxygen bottle.

185
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,080
To that point it had been a bit of a slog
working at that, at that elevation.

186
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,830
And then there was a period where we were
working through probably 45 degree

187
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,420
slope climbing up and it was knee to thigh
deep unconsolidated snow.

188
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,480
And it's, it's an amazing experience to
have to go as slowly as we were.

189
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,510
Knowing that we're going to be short on
oxygen, I was just turning off my

190
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,130
oxygen supply for a while, and climbing
without oxygen, and breaking trail for

191
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,340
stretches and it was an amazing taxing
experience.

192
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,300
I mean, it's many, many breaths, 10 or 12
breaths, take a step,

193
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,810
another 10 or 12 breaths, take a step and
try to count down and

194
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,070
do enough breaths and steps and then say,
okay I'll give myself a break.

195
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,830
Well, you could argue that you're taking a
break all the time, but it just was a,

196
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,530
an immense slog to be able to keep moving.

197
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,040
And without supplementary oxygen it was
just made that much worse.

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,860
>> And, let's go along those lines a
little bit.

199
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,790
So what else are you feeling?

200
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,010
Are you in pain?

201
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,100
Or is your mind clear or is your mind
muddled because of the hypoxia?

202
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,070
What else are you feeling at that
elevation, 27,000 feet?

203
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,980
Which is incredible.

204
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,130
>> It's a good question and

205
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:33,360
it's I, I'd call it a contextually
deprived circumstance.

206
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,625
So, all you have is a mountain.

207
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,480
>> [LAUGH]
>> The mountains going to be

208
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,130
there whether I'm there or not.

209
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,470
And then, if you want to cross check with
another individual,

210
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,120
they're going to be as hypoxic and maybe
brain damaged as you are.

211
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,650
And short of them being less responsive or

212
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:56,300
unconscious or not able to move, there's
not much of a great comparator.

213
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,235
Everything seemed to be okay.

214
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,020
>> Mm-hm.

215
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,800
>> And, you know, there was color vision
and I could look and

216
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,880
think, including that my feet were both
numb from the cold.

217
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,500
And that I did not want to, and I've been
doing a bunch of climbing before.

218
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,990
I had no interest in freezing my toes or
feet off and

219
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,550
climbing without the supplementary oxygen,
I was clearly getting my feet cold.

220
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,360
So, I could keep up with the other people
using oxygen, but I had cold feet.

221
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,050
And thought for a while, well, I can look
over on the summit ridge and

222
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,680
it's not that far to the summit.

223
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,400
I ought to be able to this, but I did not
want to freeze my feet.

224
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,050
And, made the decision, quite it seemed,
conscious and appropriate, to not

225
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,950
run the risk of freezing my feet and turn
back rather than continue to the summit.

226
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,200
An amazing experience which I had not
anticipated but did a number of times was,

227
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,450
climbing with the oxygen off and then
turning the oxygen supply on.

228
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,170
And it was to two liters per minute flow
rate, which is very modest.

229
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,380
I mean, it's a low, a low oxygen
supplementation flow rate.

230
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,650
The only way to describe it was, this is
like, the sensation which I'd never

231
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,040
imagined I'd be able to have, which is of,
the, the sensation of aerobic metabolism.

232
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,710
The equivalent would be as if somebody
took a perfect,

233
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,820
like 100 degree bucket of water and poured
it in into one's belly.

234
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,920
This sensation of warmth emanating from my
core when

235
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,760
I would turn the oxygen back on, it was
very interesting.

236
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,495
Which of course made me, the physician,
shut it off.

237
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:52,180
>> [LAUGH].
>> And then turn it back on [CROSSTALK] to

238
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,340
get that cool sensation and

239
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,330
I mentioned it to co-climbers of, how
amazing it was that you can actually feel

240
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,749
the improvement of aerobic metabolism and
generation of body heat.

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,700
Which I'd never thought and I've
subsequently learned, yeah of course,

242
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,000
people have noticed this before doing
exactly that at extremes of altitude.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,510
But it's an amazing sensation which it'd
be really hard to duplicate down

244
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,930
here except in like the Army labs
environment, where the Operation Everest.

245
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,320
I don't know whether they tried it,

246
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,795
but I suspect if they had, they probably
had the same experience.

247
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:30,440
>> Mm-hm.

248
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,050
Yeah, and also knowing it and experiencing
it are two different things.

249
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,170
So, intellectually you could know that's
going to happen, but

250
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,680
to feel that flush, that must be amazing.

251
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,370
>> Yeah the, you know, when you're hand-,
you're out, you know,

252
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,280
throwing snowballs as a kid, and you go
back in, and your hands warm up,

253
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,650
and they tingle, and then they feel so
nice and glowing warm, kind of like that.

254
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,710
But it was in your core.

255
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,260
I mean, it's an amazing experience.

256
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,430
>> So, can you share what some of those
catastrophic things were

257
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,900
that prevented you from getting a second
shot at the summit?

258
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,510
>> There were, yeah, some of, it kind of
fell into three categories.

259
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,360
There were some storms that brewed up
where it's blowing like crazy and

260
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,320
we retreated down.

261
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:18,068
There was a period of about 10 days, where
I spent as the only person up at a camp

262
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:23,464
at the base of the Lhotse face, which is,
it's a little short of 21,000 feet.

263
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:25,530
And we had a bunch of tents there and
gear.

264
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,939
And there were multiple expeditions,

265
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,640
including some New Zealanders who
subsequently didn't fare well.

266
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,430
Rob Hall among them.

267
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,920
And, so I spent a little while in storms
hanging out with the Kiwis,

268
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,680
eating some nice tasty treats and holding
the tents down.

269
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,150
And that, that blew through and

270
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,470
we then were back in a bit, a bit of a
better weather window.

271
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,250
And then had a problem where a member of a
Spanish expedition got sick, again,

272
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,420
well above the south call, in the range of
20, probably 27 to 28,000 feet.

273
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,010
He became sick with some dehydration,

274
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,560
and probably evolution of high altitude
cerebral edema.

275
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,768
Like a, a brain related hypoxic injury
circumstance can be devastating and

276
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:25,600
fatal, including in a fairly short period
of time.

277
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,480
Which actually was what killed Rob Hall's

278
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,050
climbing partner and ultimately guiding
partner, a guy named Gary Ball,

279
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,030
who died on Gashiram Four, in Pakistan of
acute cerebral edema.

280
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,370
He was sick, didn't feel so good.

281
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,170
And when the sun went down, and he was
dead by the time the sun came up.

282
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,256
So the Spanish climber got sick, was
stumbling, and had cerebral edema, and

283
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:56,010
I had to spend a lot of time helping him
get down and ultimately off the mountain.

284
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,900
So that chewed up a, a fair bit of time.

285
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:06,150
And then the other full-sail absolute
disaster was a Slovak

286
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:13,360
climbing team came up and set off to do a
fast alpine, oxygen free

287
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,910
ascent of the southwest face of Everest,
which takes off right above this camp.

288
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,460
And we loaned them a radio so

289
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,249
that they could be in contact with people
including base camp.

290
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,230
And, unfortunately what we were able then
to witness was the slow disintegration and

291
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,090
ultimately death of all four of them.

292
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,560
Initially getting sick on the very upper
edges of the southwest face.

293
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,360
One, then two behind, one finally went to
the summit.

294
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,610
And they all four then were going to try
to descend and they were asking for

295
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,770
us to help to find them because they were
going to be coming down the route

296
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,936
that we would try to ascend that night.

297
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:02,590
And bad storms and they were, you know,
making radio

298
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,820
calls to try to get us to help them saying
they'll leave their head lamps on.

299
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,990
And they probably got blown off the ridge
later, but none of them were recovered.

300
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,330
>> It must be so

301
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,540
hard to listen to that from afar, and hear
everything going wrong and be so helpless.

302
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,080
>> And here the voice, and hear the voice
of a dying person.

303
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,160
>> Yeah.
>> They were,

304
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,140
they were definitely in dire straights.

305
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,500
It was, it was quite clear even before
they said they were in dire straights,

306
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,530
that they were in, in a deep bit of
disaster.

307
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,320
And that was, between them, they had over
20 ascents of

308
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,540
peaks of 8,000 meters and they were, they
were very experienced climbers.

309
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,105
And they were just in the wrong
circumstance, at the wrong time.

310
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,150
>> Mm-hm.

311
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,330
>> And the margins, again it's, it's a
very big peak.

312
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,470
It's not technically that tricky to climb,
particularly by those routes but it's,

313
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,720
it's very high and it's the hypoxia that,
that leaves really no margins.

314
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,720
>> So on Everest, were there people that
you encountered either in the camps or

315
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,280
in your own team, that you looked at and
talked with and

316
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,760
thought, ooh, you know, they, they're on
their way to being in trouble.

317
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,830
Either because of their problems with
cognitive function or symptoms and

318
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,685
you thought that they should, really
should be going down and

319
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:21,700
you, have you had to make a call for
anyone else like that?

320
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,040
>> No, with one exception.

321
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:34,850
So my time on Everest was before the era
of commercial expeditions to Everest.

322
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:41,080
As a doc, I don't think I'd want to find
myself remotely close to Everest Base Camp

323
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,540
now, because I might be frightened at the
broad range, much broader range of

324
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,210
experience, and climbing skill, and time
in the mountains.

325
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,350
And might be much more frightened by some
people who have relatively less experience

326
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,610
and are thus, maybe unwittingly, at the
mercy of the elements and

327
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,480
a guide much more than I would ever want
to find myself.

328
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,210
So I, it's nice to go to the mountains,

329
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,170
I would choose to go to anything except
Everest again.

330
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,850
>> No business being there at this point,
yeah.

331
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,270
>> Yeah.
We did have one, one interesting

332
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,658
experience, which is sort of a nice little
physiologic quirk.

333
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:30,460
Which is a, a really terrific ranked long
distance runner

334
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,990
accompanied our expedition because he
wanted to be there, not because he had

335
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,450
a lot of climbing experience, but wanted
to go to Everest Base Camp.

336
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,740
And along the, and he also happened to be
a doc and

337
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,050
along the way, in talking, I said, well,
this is really interesting.

338
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,970
because, you know, marathon runners have
fairly blunted ventilatory drives,

339
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:02,360
they tend in general not to breathe so
rapidly in response to hypercapnia,

340
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,020
CO2 going up, or hypoxia, O2 going down,
and you're one of those.

341
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,970
You're an elite athlete in a different
field and your breathing response

342
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,115
might well be the thing that wouldn't be
so good if you encounter extreme

343
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:23,920
sulp-hypoxia because what you really want
to do is breathe like crazy.

344
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,920
And he didn't really like the implication
that I might find that

345
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,120
he was going to not do well.

346
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,110
But in fact, at progressive elevation, he
just felt terrible.

347
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,390
Probably because in part,

348
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,450
not because he isn't a great athlete, but
because his ventilatory

349
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,730
response probably makes him much more
suitable to be a marathon runner.

350
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,700
Where we're clearly coming from different
flavors and, and

351
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,710
our physiologic backdrop context probably
does have bearing.

352
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,510
As I oftentimes say in these physiology
lectures, we are ourselves,

353
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,005
and we do well that which we do well.

354
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:06,240
>> [LAUGH]
>> You can't make me be a high speed,

355
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,610
100 meter runner because I am all about
slow twitch fibers.

356
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,380
And I do very well, because I pant like a
dog when I'm hypoxic.

357
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,870
And that's probably why I like going to
elevation.

358
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,632
because it works.

359
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:20,430
>> Mm-hm.

360
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:25,920
>> Whereas somebody who doesn't have that
very exquisite adaptive ventilatory

361
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,270
response doesn't tend to do so well.

362
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,217
>> It's fun to watch that physiology play
out in real life [LAUGH]

363
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:32,120
>> Yeah, yeah, but my other,

364
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,095
my other statement is choose your parents
wisely.

365
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,200
>> [LAUGH] Exactly.

366
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,430
And so what is it like when you come back
from being at altitude for

367
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,280
that long of a time?

368
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,660
Do you notice things in your daily
existence that's different,

369
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,770
in your physiology I should say?

370
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,248
>> Yeah, one of the things one notices is
people saying, my god you're a skeleton.

371
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,190
>> [LAUGH]
>> So I, I weigh probably 165 now.

372
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,560
I weighed probably 175 pounds going to
Everest.

373
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,190
And I lost 12 kilos of weight.

374
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,160
>> That's a lot of weight.

375
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,588
>> So I look like a stick figure coming
back.

376
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:18,190
the, the muscle, just fuel wasting.

377
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,780
You burn up lots and lots and lots of
calories, and it's just,

378
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:29,120
it's impressively difficult to eat that
much to keep the weight on.

379
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,072
One's appetite suffers greatly.

380
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:36,390
So the, the weight loss is, is an amazing
feature right up front, and

381
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,120
it makes you feel incredibly weak doing
that.

382
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,569
At lesser elevations, where you don't tend
to lose so much muscle mass.

383
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,640
One of the amazing features is how that
adaptation of

384
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,710
higher elevation exposure makes your body
run really well.

385
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,890
I mean, you get a, a beneficial adaptive
response,

386
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:05,580
which is why so many category one cyclists
now live in Boulder, Colorado.

387
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,400
Because they get to spend some time at, at
relatively modest elevations, but

388
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,970
they get that higher altitude modest
hypoxia adaptation response.

389
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,370
So there's some of that, and

390
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,060
I've certainly noticed on other trips
coming back feeling va-va-voom.

391
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,980
Being able to out-ride my cycling buddies
here by easy strides.

392
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,060
I mean, I can just run away from them.

393
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,110
From that adaptive response.

394
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,930
The other thing that, that I've noticed
which actually was fairly carefully cat-,

395
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:44,910
categorized on our Everest trip was, we
had some funding from NASA to,

396
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:50,570
to do some neurologic evaluation.

397
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,898
So this is learning and memory.

398
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:59,010
So psycho-motor evaluation.

399
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:04,650
And the interesting and frightening things
were that fine motor,

400
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:10,570
like finger, literally, simple little
finger tap tests suffers greatly.

401
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:17,740
You don't do it so well during and after
extreme hypoxia exposure.

402
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,320
>> How long after?

403
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,730
>> Mm.
Sometimes fairly scary amounts.

404
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,630
>> Like forever [LAUGH]?

405
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,840
>> The work studied, the sixth month

406
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,290
post exposure data are getting back to but
not fully back to the baseline state.

407
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,270
The other thing that flies apart is,

408
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,850
learning of new knowledge under profound
hypoxia is appalling.

409
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,980
I mean, you're back to, fairly rudimentary
skills.

410
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,950
When it, when it comes to just learning
new information.

411
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,170
And this is sort of rote recollection of
number sequence, word sequence, and

412
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,870
then to regurgitate it in a test
circumstance.

413
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,940
And the test circumstance happened to be,
you know,

414
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,842
like sitting in a tent at 24,000 feet
going through these damn NASA test reels.

415
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,616
But the ability to remember is, is really
impaired.

416
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:18,730
And I find my, found myself back as an
academic in the hallways of my parent

417
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:24,855
institution, seeing people and not quite
being able to pull out their names.

418
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:25,840
>> Uh-oh.

419
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,775
I do that anyway.

420
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:27,310
[LAUGH]

421
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,120
>> It was, it was profoundly, noticeably
worse.

422
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,600
On arrival back in Kathmandu, I wanted to
call my wife when we were back,

423
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,580
you know, around the telephone.

424
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,050
I wanted to call her and say hi, you know,
back to civilization, doing well.

425
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:48,720
I could not remember my own phone number,
but I could remember, sort of, deep back

426
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,580
cobwebs, my parent's phone number, which
had not changed for 25 years.

427
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,700
So I called them to find out what my own
phone number was so

428
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,380
I could call my wife and tell her.

429
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,050
>> Did that worry them [LAUGH] that you
couldn't remember your own phone number?

430
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,300
>> No, I found it a little disconcerting,
but they seemed to be okay with it.

431
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,040
>> Just a couple more questions.

432
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,350
So are there any life lessons that you
took away from the mountain that you've

433
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,310
brought back to either your work or your
personal life?

434
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,580
>> I think, yeah.

435
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,340
And the, the short answer is, yes.

436
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,720
I think the slightly longer answer is that
I think climbing,

437
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,410
however radically different from being a
doc,

438
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,165
including an intensive care medicine
doctor.

439
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:38,740
That the circumstances of climbing in the
mountain and

440
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,660
being responsible for lots of things.

441
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,300
And having, having to sort out problems
from

442
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:53,510
little to suddenly massively large
problems without the,

443
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,800
the immediate recourse to somebody that,
for somebody to come in and save the ship.

444
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,680
Makes, either calls from all of us in
humanity, a subset of people

445
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,080
who don't mind that stress circumstance
and can sort their way through it.

446
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,360
Or helps those of us who get in that
circumstance,

447
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,150
adapt our way into thinking more clearly
in problem solving sorts of ways.

448
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:26,960
So I think there's, there's a nice
bi-directional help of my medicine

449
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,028
exposure and my alpine climbing exposure
to, I think make each of them better.

450
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:36,440
>> Sort of self-sufficiency that comes
with that.

451
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,930
>> Yeah, and, and need to problem solve
and not lose grasp of the situation.

452
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,786
>> Good and what kind of advice would you
give to young students who may be

453
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:50,334
watching this or older students who may be
watching this,

454
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:52,699
who want to get into mountaineering and
climbing?

455
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,575
>> Get yourself out there and get exposed.

456
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:03,160
I, I think it's, if there's not a love for

457
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:10,240
being out there, then I think the rest
will just seem overly, drudgery.

458
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,440
but, but if you, if you like being out in
the mountains then,

459
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,320
then a lot of the rest of it really fills
in, in due course.

460
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,940
And spend time out, out in the sticks
alone and

461
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,730
get used to that sense of being out there
because it's incredibly beautiful and

462
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,750
it's fun to be out there and it's great to
not have people be around.

463
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,280
So long as that's comfortable and

464
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,060
if that's uncomfortable, then you're
probably in the wrong place.

465
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:44,630
But I think as you develop increasing
comfort simply being in, in a solitary

466
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,620
circumstance, then the details of climbing
skills and exposure and

467
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,321
technique and experience, I think will
fill themselves in quite handily.

468
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,150
>> Good.
>> Yeah.

469
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,150
>> And the last question.

470
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,690
Do you have some take home message from
your experience in the mountains or

471
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,360
climbing or life that you'd like to share
with our audience?

472
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,459
>> yeah, I guess, since we were talking
before we got online about a recent

473
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,370
accident of breaking my legs and getting
them patched back together climbing.

474
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,410
There are, there are risks, but I think
the rewards are so

475
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:28,140
vastly greater that it's, it's, in the
analysis, a great thing to do.

476
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,030
I, I, I love the exposure and I think
people ought to try to get more of that.

477
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,920
>> Alright.

478
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,550
We'll end it there.

479
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,440
Thank you so much.
