00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,470
Our environmental physiology class is
about how your body response and

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,025
adapts to the world around you.

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,540

experiences of

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,060
your TA who will be placed in extreme
environments we will be discussing.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,380
[SOUND] You'll be traveling to these
environments, observing his responses, and

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,020
listening to discussions by top scientists
in the field.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,900
Through this process, you'll be engaged in
a journey of discovery about your body.

hot, you can fry an egg on the pavement.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,700
So cold, your spit freezes before it hits
the ground.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,270
And so high, most people would die without
supplemental oxygen.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,858
Our power of survival is awesome.

13
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:52,654
