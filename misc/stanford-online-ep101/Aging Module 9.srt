1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,822
Many people don't want to age at all and
certainly don't want to die prematurely.

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:10,810
The anti-aging, aging market is estimated
to be $50 billion annually.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,630
People are looking for a quick fix that
doesn't require any behavioral changes,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,350
which are too much work.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,900
In a sense we're all already part of a
huge anti-aging network.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,380
We have medicines that people take
regularly to combat diabetes,

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,180
high blood pressure, cardiovascular
disease and high cholesterol.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,070
All of which are conditions that are known
to be associated with aging and

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,320
to shorten healthy lifespan.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,848
But consumers, and thus drug companies,
are looking behind standard medicines for

11
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:41,790
a magic bullet that doesn't just treat the
diseases associated with aging, but

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,805
targets the aging process itself.

13
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:48,060
Anti-aging clinics and therapies abound.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,530
The clinics range from well-meaning
physicians promoting what they believe,

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,140
through research or personal experience,
will help their patients, to opportunistic

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,149
snake oil salesmen, who only wish to
profit from people's fears and vanities.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,870
Many of the popular treatments at clinics
involve hormone therapy such as

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,420
human growth hormone, testosterone, and a
sex steroid hormone precursor DHEA.

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,470
These hormones are anabolic or
growth-promoting and normally decline with

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,810
age, making it hard for us to maintain our
strength function and vitality.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,560
Although each of these hormones I just
listed have been associated research

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,080
studies with positive benefits such as
increased strength, libido, bone density

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,910
and more, there are also many studies that
show minimal benefit, negative side

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,000
effects and a substantially increased risk
for diseases, including cancer.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,350
If you think about it,

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,670
if you give a growth promoting agent to
cells that may have

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,800
accumulated damage over your lifetime, you
do risk stimulating tumor growth.

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,850
The anti-aging properties of these
hormones remain debatable.

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,490
In fact, debatable, unconfirmed, needs
further study, are phrases frequently

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,960
associated with drugs, hormones,
interventions in the anti-aging field.

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,540
What follows in this module is information
on what we do know so far.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,660
I've spent eight previous modules talking
about

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,790
the benefits of physical activity on
healthy aging.

34
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,140
I think you get the idea.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,800
So on this slide I just want to give a
couple of

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,410
examples that quantify the information for
you.

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,800
A 2008 study by Khaw et al demonstrated
that combined positive behaviors,

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,290
regular physical activity, lots of fruits
and

39
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,530
vegetables, moderate to low alcohol
consumption and

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,700
not smoking, made people functionally
equivalent to 14 years younger.

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,300
Think about that a moment, 14 years.

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,210
So if you're currently 74, it would be
more like you're 60.

43
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,340
If you're currently 60, you could feel
like you're 46.

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,379
Those are big difference and could mean a
lot more play time with your grandkids.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,750
In another example,

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,580
a 2011 report by Wenitall on over 400,000
Taiwanese adults suggested that as little

47
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,910
15 minutes a day of activity could
increase life expectancy by three years.

48
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,710
Do you have a spare 15 minutes today to
lengthen your life?

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,170
On this slide, I say proven and doable.

50
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,680
I didn't say proven and easy.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,100
Because long-term behavior change is not
easy for most of us but it is possible.

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,810
With physical activity, ideally you should
meet the recommended minimum guidelines of

53
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,420
30 minutes per day, five days a week, of
moderate intensity activity.

54
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,660
I've posted the full American College of
Sports Medicine guidelines in

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,560
the Resource section.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,720
But if you're not active at all right now
and

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,630
that seems overly ambitious, just start
doing something.

58
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,120
Any small amount, even that 15
minutes-a-day walk, can help.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,470
Oh, and limit your prolonged sitting
whenever possible.

60
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,930
I have good nutrition on the slide as
well.

61
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,870
In the context of healthy aging, good
nutrition is simple.

62
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,370
Lots of fruits and vegetables, whole
grains and

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,350
healthy fats, real non-processed foods,
lean protein sources and

64
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,330
minimal saturated fats and simple sugars.

65
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,180
Pretty standard stuff that you hear about
over and over again.

66
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,780
Not complicated but not necessarily easy
either.

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,490
Moderate alcohol consumption for

68
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,706
this study was considered between one and
14 drinks per day.

69
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:30,250
I mean, no [LAUGH] I mean during, per
week, not per day.

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,390
And no smoking is, well, no smoking.

71
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,430
In addition to physical activity improving
healthy lifespan,

72
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,309
there's also some indication it may impact
the aging process itself.

73
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,390
Telomeres are the little protective caps
on the ends of our

74
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,140
chromosomes within our cells.

75
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,880
They're involved with the cell replication
process and get shorter over time.

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,620
The length of telomeres is thought to be
an indication of cell age and

77
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,560
once they get too short the cell dies.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,940
Although the relationship between telomere
length and

79
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,960
aging may be more nuanced than originally
thought, it is generally agreed that

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,880
longer telomeres are better in terms of
health and aging.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,110
Observations have been made that people
who exercise regularly have

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,830
longer telomeres than those who don't,
even within identical twins, so

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,159
the same genetic make up.

84
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,300
Further, a recent 2013 pilot study
published in Lancet demonstrated that

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,970
five years of healthy behaviors that
included regular walking exercise,

86
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,580
a plant-based diet, relaxation techniques
and social support groups

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,810
actually lengthened telomeres in a group
of men with early stage prostate cancer.

88
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,190
In contrast, the telomeres in a control
group continued to shorten over that time.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,160
Larger studies will need to be completed,
but

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,170
information on this topic looks promising.

91
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Another factor involved with aging is
accumulative damage in the mitochondria.

92
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,970
Throughout much of our lives we have
mechanisms that repair this damage, but

93
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,460
the repair mechanisms start to weaken over
time.

94
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,460
A study comparing muscle of sedentary and
resistance trained old and

95
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,170
young men showed that with resistance
training both the appearance of

96
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,250
the mitochondria and the transcription
signatures, sort of the gene activity,

97
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,660
in older men looked more like those of
younger men.

98
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,490
This suggests that resistance training not
only increases strength but

99
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,080
may have a rejuvenating affect on muscle
structure as well.

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,360
A more recent study investigated the
effects of endurance exercise on mice that

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,120
were genetically designed to lack the
mitochondrial repair mechanisms.

102
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,000
These knockout mice age twice as fast as
the normal mice.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,710
However, half of them were put on a
regular running routine which

104
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,970
essentially eliminated the premature
aging.

105
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,250
It's amazing.

106
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,880
Here's a picture of two of the mice from
that knockout study.

107
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,570
The mouse on your right didn't exercise.

108
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,800
The mouse on the left did.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,220
They're both the same chronological age.

110
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,700
The group of mice that didn't exercise had
all sorts of problems,

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,290
including increased disease risk,
oxidative stress damage,

112
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:20,030
body composition change, enlarged heart,
even gray and thinning hair.

113
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,120
In contrast, the running mice appeared
much more normal for their age.

114
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,310
Keep in mind that these mice are not a
perfect model for

115
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,710
aging, because it's so extreme.

116
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,650
Still, it does suggest that physical
activity may improve that key element of

117
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,610
cellular repair.

118
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,410
So if the previous lifestyle factors were
doable but difficult,

119
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,070
this next one is actually really
difficult, [LAUGH] caloric restriction.

120
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,100
Caloric restriction, as I mentioned
earlier,

121
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,320
refers to a 30 to 60% reduction from
normal weight-stable caloric intake.

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,490
But without malnutrition, so meaning you
get all your micro nutrients and vitamins.

123
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,730
Caloric restriction has been shown to
reduce age associated diseases,

124
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,150
median lifespan and

125
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,665
maximal lifespan in many species from
worms all the way up to monkeys.

126
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:17,460
However, a recent 2012 long-term primate
studies showed that

127
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,970
caloric restriction didn't extend lifespan
in that group of monkeys.

128
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,630
So now people are confused as to whether
it will actually work in humans.

129
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,150
Even so, a lot of work has been done to
figure out why this works in so

130
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,180
many different species.

131
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,260
One possible explanation is that
under-eating causes metabolic rate to

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,800
slow which in turn causes reduction in the
mechanism of living and

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,500
a reduction in oxidative stress, which can
cause cellular damage.

134
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,520
Another theory suggests that a little low
grade stress brought on by

135
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,940
caloric restriction actually strengthens
an organism's defenses,

136
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,770
a phenomenon referred to as hormesis.

137
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,970
There's also an important new finding that
the reduction in insulin that

138
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,530
comes from caloric restriction leads to
increased activity in the FoxO pathway,

139
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,534
that then improves repair mechanisms
within the cell.

140
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:14,870
Incidentally, the insulin FoxO pathway is

141
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,890
also involved in that original gene
experiment by Cynthia Kenyon that

142
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,065
doubled the lifespan of worms that I
mentioned way back in Module Two.

143
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:25,460
[SOUND] Seems like a long time ago.

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,070
And finally, there are a number of
signalling molecules that seem to

145
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,470
be altered either up or down in the cell
in response to caloric restriction,

146
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,690
like the sirtuins, AMPK, and TOR.

147
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,480
Those signaling molecules are important
because they have led to a better

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,930
understanding of why substances like
resveratrol and rapamycin can mimic some

149
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,389
of the effects of caloric restriction, in
terms of longevity and disease prevention.

150
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,740
Since it is so hard to maintain caloric
restriction throughout one's lifetime,

151
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,397
these mimetics may end up being our best
possibilities to improve health and

152
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,420
longevity, although we don't have any
definitive answers yet.

153
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,540
Incidentally, resveratrol first gained
attention as

154
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,370
the first possible explanation to the
French paradox.

155
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,920
A little shout-out to all of you watching
from France.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,675
The French paradox describes the
unexpected finding of the French

157
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:26,360
population's good health and vitality,
despite drinking lots of wine and eating

158
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,230
foods that aren't considered optimally
healthy such as lots of bread and cheese.

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,540
It was thought that perhaps the
resveratrol found in grape skins, and

160
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,490
thus wine, was counteracting the negative
effects of an unhealthy diet.

161
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,380
However, as I mentioned earlier in Module
Two, it would take a lot of wine for

162
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,980
it to have such a beneficial effect.

163
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,890
So maybe it's all of that walking, slow
food, as opposed to our fast food here,

164
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,789
and good genes that actually explains the
good health in France.

165
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,090
The last thing I'd like to talk about is
the possibility of

166
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,040
increasing our repair mechanisms
especially in muscle.

167
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,070
As I've said before, part of the loss of
function and increased recovery time that

168
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,480
we experience with age is due to poor
repair mechanisms in our cells.

169
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,080
For example, when we damage muscle tissue
during exercise, stem or

170
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,550
satellite cells will jump into action to
repair the damage and or

171
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,880
replace destroyed cells with new ones.

172
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,450
This is true whether the injury is big,
like a muscle tear, or

173
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,240
small, like micro damage that results in
delayed onset muscles soreness, or

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,510
DOMS, that we feel 24 to 48 hours after
vigorous or unusual activity.

175
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,990
Older tissue has stem cells like younger
tissue, but

176
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,670
they're not as responsive as the stem
cells in younger tissue.

177
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,860
Are they worn out?

178
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,010
Are they damaged?

179
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,380
What's going on?

180
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,070
How can we get them to perk back up?

181
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,590
Well, it turns out that the stem cells are
actually in pretty good shape.

182
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,990
It's the surrounding environment that's a
bit problematic.

183
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,750
Tom Rando, who we interview at the end of
this section by the way, and

184
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,405
others in the field have found that if you
put old stem cells in

185
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:13,175
young tissue environments, they start to
behave like young stem cells.

186
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:17,830
Dr. Rando first discovered this by
connecting the circulations of

187
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,910
two mice together that had damaged
muscles.

188
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,260
One was young and one was old.

189
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,440
What they found was that the older mouse
recovered faster than other mice it's

190
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,070
age and ended up with less scar tissue in
it's repaired muscle.

191
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,840
The experiment showed that there was
something circulating in

192
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,989
the blood of younger animals that could
make older stem cells behave younger.

193
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,320
His lab and others have since identified
several substances involved with aging and

194
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,550
stem cell regulation.

195
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,278
This is potentially huge.

196
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,250
It means that maybe down the road we can
use those substances to regenerate old or

197
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,670
damaged tissue in a way that resembles
young, healthy tissue.

198
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,490
Master's athletes, muscle wasting with
aging,

199
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,230
disease states like muscle dystrophy, even
young athletes facing a major

200
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,590
injury could all derive huge benefits from
this type of research, very exciting.

201
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,210
Watch Tom Rando's interview at the end of
this section for

202
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,715
more details on his exciting aging
research.

203
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,279
Wow, you did it.

204
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,330
[LAUGH]

205
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,680
If your watching this, you made it through
the monster aging section.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,790
There is the one bonus module on exercise
and

207
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,430
the common cold at the end, but that's an
optional bit of information.

208
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,970
There's no quiz questions on it, but

209
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,710
I think you'll find it as relevent and
interesting.

210
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,490
So check it out.

211
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,170
But of course, I think all of this
physiology is relevant and interesting, so

212
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,905
I'm a bit biased.

213
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,250
Anyway, thank you for sticking with it.

214
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,260
I really hope you learn things that will
help you as you move forward in your life,

215
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,710
no matter how old or how active you are
right now.

216
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,310
Next week, you get the physiology of
stress.

217
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,690
We have a big surprise for you in that
one, so stayed tuned.

218
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,190
Thank you.
