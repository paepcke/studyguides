1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,530
Alright?
>> Alright.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,070
>> Take her away.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,570
>> Oky doky.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,270
In this module, we're going to look at how
your muscles change with age and

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,670
what strength training can do for you in
your later years.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,050
One point of clarification before I start.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,200
I will use weight training, resistance
training and

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
strength training interchangeably in this
section.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,040
When I do, I mean the same thing.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,340
Muscle training against some type of
resistance such as free weights,

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,990
machines, stretchy bands, or the wall in
order to increase our strength.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,090
Strength is the force your muscles can
generate.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,640
On average, there is about an 8% decrease
in strength per decade starting at

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,260
around 45 years old.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,740
The 8% can vary depending on where you
start in terms of strength,

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,550
whether you remain active, you genes, and
I'm not talking about your Levis, and

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,400
whether you are measuring your upper or
lower body strength.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,700
As you might expect, lower body strength
is maintained better because you

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,390
tend to use your legs moving about more in
everyday life.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,000
The losses will accelerate in later years
as well.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,900
As you get older, you experience
Sarcopenia, or muscle loss,

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,070
that comes both from a decrease in muscle
fiber size, and a decrease in fiber and

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,035
motor unit number.

24
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,250
Do you remember what a motor unit is?

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,870
It is a grouping of muscle fibers that is
innervated by a single nerve,

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,910
the alpha motor neuron.

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,880
The loss of fiber number is called
Hypoplasia.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,380
It frequently happens with your type two
muscle fibers that you tend to

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,830
under use as you get older.

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,530
Remember that your type two fibers are
your big high intensity strength fibers.

31
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,500
Throughout your life, they are denervated
and

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,850
then renervated to keep that neuron fresh.

33
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,220
If you don't use them as you age, your
body won't bother to renovate them and

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,020
that process and they will eventually fade
away from lack of recruitment or use.

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,860
Doing high resistance strength training,
training to fatigue, or things like

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,509
spring training will help maintain those
bigger, stronger Type II fibers.

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,260
To my right, is a sample graph of what
knee extension strength might typically

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,090
look like in untrained men, versus men who
weight trained throughout their lives.

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,210
Weight trained men, represented by the
blue line, are stronger to begin with.

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,440
They start to decline in strength later,
and

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,590
they do not fall off as rapidly as
untrained men.

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,210
Again, there could be a lot of variability
in these curves for

43
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,240
different people, but you get the general
idea.

44
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,700
Muscle power becomes an issue as we get
older as well.

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,660
Aging muscle has decreased velocity of
shortening.

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,030
That means we can't contract our muscles
as quickly,

47
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,480
because of a variety of neural factors
such as Decreased neural drive,

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,730
poor fiber recruitment, and slowed nerve
firing rates.

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,720
Power is equal to force times velocity, or

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,110
in other words, a combination of force and
speed.

51
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,180
So small reductions in both force and

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,810
velocity, can result in larger losses of
power.

53
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,510
We need power for many of our activities
of daily living, like climbing stairs.

54
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,680
Standing up out of a chair, or catching
yourself to prevent falls.

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,560
Some researchers and health care
providers,

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,720
argue that power training should be added
to regular strength training to

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,660
older adults, to help maintain optimum
muscle recruitment and faster firing race.

58
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,750
Power training in older adults consist of
lifting lighter weights at a faster speed.

59
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,120
People should work up to power training
program, though,

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
to reduce the risk of injuries.

61
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,770
For more information on power training,

62
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,980
see the resource unit at the end of the
section.

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,720
There's a saying that on average, a 20
year old uses 20% of his or

64
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,700
her strength to get out of a chair, and an
80 year old uses 80% of their strength.

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,670
But that is on average.

66
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,340
That means that some 80 year olds will
take 60% of their strength, and

67
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,920
some will take 100%.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,750
You definitely want to be on the good side
of that average,

69
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,450
because if it takes you 100% or more of
your strength to get out of a chair, or

70
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,380
off of the toilet for example, you're
going to,

71
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,450
you're not going to be able to get up
without someone else helping you.

72
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,360
That obviously would be a major blow to
your independence and qulaity of life.

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,010
The good news is that, in the case of
muscle, all of the decrements and function

74
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,340
can be improved with regular physical
activity, especially resistance training.

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,540
Even so, regular activity is not going to
make an 80 year old look 20.

76
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,620
There's too much water under the bridge,
so to speak.

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,250
Hormones change over time, so there are
lower concentrations of those anabolic, or

78
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,630
growth promoting hormones, in both men and
women.

79
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,720
Stem cells that normally repair damage in
the young get less responsive as we age,

80
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,890
we'll talk about that in the last module
some more,

81
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,590
scientists are trying to whip those old
tired stem cells into shape.

82
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,900
And there's also cumulative damage to the
tissues, organs and

83
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,770
muscles that start to add up over time
resulting in less than optimal function.

84
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,630
Of course, it's better if you exercise
throughout your life, but

85
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,880
you're never too old to start.

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,240
I could give lots of examples here on how
exercise benefits aging muscle.

87
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,780
But this study published in 1990 has the
oldest mean age of participants that I

88
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,060
could find.

89
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,380
Investigators put frail, elderly men and
women, ranging in age from 87 to 96,

90
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,105
on eight weeks of high-intensity
resistance training.

91
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,180
After that time, their thigh muscles, the
thigh muscle strength and

92
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,370
thigh cross sectional area had increased
by 174 and 9% respectively.

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,090
The trainee showed increased gait speed,
stair climbing power, and

94
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,830
improved balance.

95
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,240
Also, they got a bonus of increase
spontaneous aerobic activity levels.

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,780
So more walking and moving around.

97
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,420
You frequently see this when frail people
start to, a resistance training program.

98
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,690
They get a little stronger,

99
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,760
they have more confidence, they feel
better about themselves, and

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,290
so they are more interested in
participating in other activities.

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,469
In this way, you can get a spiraling up of
activity and fitness.

102
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,650
Unfortunately, the opposite is also true.

103
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,780
If someone has a fall or they stop
exercising and start to lose strength it

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,970
can be harder and harder for them to get
back into their normal movement routines.

105
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,630
Anyway, the bottom line is that you are
never too old to benefit from exercise.

106
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,740
And that nothing so

107
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,260
far is as effective at reversing muscle
loss as resistance training.

108
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,730
It used to be that people thought that
exercise was only for the young and

109
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,530
after a certain point, why bother really?

110
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,740
But now we know the critical importance it
plays in maintaning our health and

111
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,140
well being.

112
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,890
We see from studies like the last one I
just showed you,

113
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,140
that really substantial and important
benefits can be obtained at any age.

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,770
There is no doubt that it gets harder both
psychologically and

115
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,010
physically to maintain a program of
activity as you get older.

116
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,260
Doing what, doing whatever you can is
better than nothing.

117
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,480
For example, if you have mobility issues,
join a chair aerobics class.

118
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
If you're overweight and

119
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,850
have joint pain, try swimming or joining a
water movement class.

120
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,980
There are options out there that can work
for you.

121
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,110
Time to take a mini-break.

122
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,490
Wake up, grab some coffee or better yet,
move, stretch, jump up and down.

123
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,880
In fact, why don't you put your computer
on something higher and

124
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,090
watch Module five standing up.

125
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,340
Give those legs a little something more to
do and

126
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,820
start your process of healthy aging.

127
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,830
Just an idea.

128
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,410
See you in a bit.
