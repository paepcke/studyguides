00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,537
Welcome back to Module 5 - Minimizing the
Negatives.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:09,360
We just spent a couple of modules talking
about how hypothermia negatively impacts

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,650
endurance and maximum performance.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,260
It's time to share some ideas on what you
can do to help relieve the heat

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,240
related stress and negative impacts.

6
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:23,890
The most obvious thing that will help you
in the heat is acclimatization.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,510
Your body, the amazing machine that it is,

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,470
will quickly adapt to its new environment
to try to make things easier for you.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,170
Complete heat acclimatization takes up to
14 days, but

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,719
some of the early adaptations occur within
the first week.

11
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:43,540
Early in the process, plasma volume will
increase in response to

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,570
more plasma proteins and increase sodium
chloride retention in the kidney.

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,490
Increase plasma volume means more blood
available to go to the skin,

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,550
working muscles and back to the heart.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,069
So heart rate and perceived exertion will
return closer to baseline during exercise.

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,510
Exercising in heat will accelerate the
acclimatization process.

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,590
The body also adjusts a variety of
parameters relating to

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,270
sweat during the acclimatization period.

19
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,800
Sweat rate can increase three times to
above two liters per hour.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,400
You start to sweat more evenly over your
body rather just in your armpits and feet.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,580
You sweat sooner to try and prevent an
initial rise in core temperature.

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,520
And you reabsorb more of the electrolytes
in your sweat and

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,620
urine to minimize electrolyte losses.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,560
Interestingly, some of these adaptations
can be achieved simply by training,

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,320
even in a cool environment.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,960
Things like plasma volume expansion and

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,990
increased sweat rates are normal training
outcomes.

28
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,020
However, the adaptations will be greater
and

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,030
faster if the training is done in the
heat.

30
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,670
Heat acclimatization adaptations may
disappear after only a few days or

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,490
weeks without the heat stress stimulus.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,400
The first adaptations to change back are
those that develop first,

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,570
plasma volume and heart rate.

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,610
How fast you lose the adaptation depends
on the number of heat exposures per week,

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,250
and the intensity and type of training
sessions.

36
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,282
If you've already acclimatized, and you're
looking for

37
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:17,090
more of an edge, there are some cooling
strategies you can employ.

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,260
Remember that you only want to be using
cooling methods,

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,510
if you're doing some prolonged exercise
when core, skin or

40
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,420
muscle temperature are at risk of climbing
above optimal levels.

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,420
Ice vests, ice packs, mist fans, and cool
air have all been used by atheletes and

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,288
have been studied in the lab with mixed
results.

43
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:39,390
The bottom line is that they can lower
subjective feelings of discomfort but

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,150
their positive impact on performance is
still debatable.

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,490
Varied study designs and lack of true
performance outcomes,

46
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,750
make recommendations of particular
methodologies, challenging.

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,530
Cooling of hands, feet, and especially the
full limbs through a variety of

48
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,680
techniques has been shown to reduce core
heat load during physical activity and

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
accelerate cooling during hyperthermia.

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,960
You saw this when Corey was in the hot
room.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,250
Simply putting his hands into cold water
brought his core temperature down.

52
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,610
The technique capitalizes on the venous
anastomoses,

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,430
the heat exchanging vessels that we've
mentioned before.

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,590
And other surface vessels as a means to
dump heat out to

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,200
the cool surrounding temperatures.

56
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,430
This now, now well researched technique
reminds me of

57
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,020
a time way back when I was 10 years old.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,140
And I went to Farvey Ranch Camp in a very
hot place called Marysville, California.

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,200
On a particularly hot day, I was told by
Joy Palmerly,

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,120
the owner of the camp, to run my hands
under the drinking fountain to cool off.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,930
It was surprisingly effective, and must be
based on the same principle of bringing

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,730
cool blood back to the core, meaning
cooling from the inside out.

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,590
Common wisdom meets science.

64
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,500
Joy, you were ahead of your time.

65
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,070
Another extensively studied method of
cooling is

66
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,260
precooling with cold water immersion.

67
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,830
Precooling of both skin an core has been
shown to improve performance.

68
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,140
The fundamental idea is that by lowering
core temperature prior to exercise,

69
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,690
an athlete has a greater capacity for heat
storage, before they fatigue.

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,540
That allows a higher self selected work
rate, lower sweat rate,

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,420
smaller initial cardiovascular changes and
decreased central fatigue.

72
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,685
If a higher initial work rate is selected,

73
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:32,470
then eventually core temperature will
catch up.

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,890
But more work will have, will, will have
been completed before that time.

75
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,660
The specifics of how precooling is
achieved logistically in the field, and

76
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,020
how it interacts with an athlete's warmup
is not easily resolved.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,630
However scientifically the methodology
seems to have merit in

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,860
situations with hypothermia is a critical
factor.

79
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,380
Because of the connection between skin
temperature and performance mentioned in

80
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,375
module three, it's not surprising that
many of these methods result in

81
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,230
cooler skin temperatures, either as a
focus or as a beneficial side

82
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,390
effect can positively impact performance,
at least to a small degree.

83
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,240
If you're going to be training and

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,180
competing in the heat, there are some
adjustments you should consider.

85
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,930
Training volume and intensity should be
reduced but some short, high-intensity

86
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,820
bouts should remain in your workout even
early on in the exposure process.

87
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,620
Consider reducing the intensity and

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,250
duration of your warm-up to minimize
pre-event heat storage.

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,958
Practice your competitive race pace in the
heat to evaluate temperature rises and

90
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,360
sweat race.

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,030
Monitor first morning void urine color and
body weight for dehydration status.

92
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,760
Increase your fluid intake both during
training and through out the day.

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,680
Select appropriate clothing.

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,402
Depending on the environment and event,

95
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:58,180
loose-fitting, long-sleeve, breathable
fabrics may be better than exposed skin.

96
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,160
For example, during the Badwater Marathon,
which is a grueling race across

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,530
Death Valley desert, most runners are at
least covered up on their upper bodies.

98
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,860
The coverage prevents radiant heat gains,
sunburn, and

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,960
provides an evaporative cooling layer
close to the skin.

100
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,190
Before we move on to Module 6,

101
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,720
I'd like to say a couple words about drugs
and hypothermia.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
Disturbances in dopamine and serotonin in
the brain have been

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,330
implicated in central fatigue associated
with hypothermia.

104
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,350
Therefore, drugs that target the
metabolism of those neurotransmitters have

105
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,959
been used to manipulate CNS control of
hypothermia-induced fatigue.

106
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,190
The studies are interesting,

107
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,310
because they give insights into the
underlying mechanisms of fatigue.

108
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,240
The drugs also have shown some limited
success in

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
improving performance in the heat.

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,160
However, because the drugs override the
body's natural protective response to

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,740
hypothermia, a person is at far greater
risk of thermal injury.

112
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,870
Therefore, such drugs should be avoided,
in non controlled laboratory settings.

113
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,780
Speaking of risks, that's what's up next,
in Module 6, Risks, Consequences and

114
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,690
Practical Tips.
