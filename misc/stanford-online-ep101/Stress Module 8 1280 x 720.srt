1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,330
Welcome back to the physiology of stress.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,760
I hope you enjoyed the activity that ended
our last session.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,268
It's one of my favorite tools that we will
touch on in detail in the tools video

4
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:11,812
of this module.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,440
It's pretty incredible how a simple five
minute activity can have

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,080
such a profound impact on the body.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,620
Especially when we repeat it over time.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,670
We're going to take our experience of
activating the parasympathetic nervous

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,180
system with this technique to guide us
through an understanding of

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,140
the physiology occuring in our bodies.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,170
The knowledge gives us the opportunity to
shed light on how our bodies work and

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,650
the possibility of using this information
in real life.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,750
So let's get curious and find out if any
of this science can make our life better.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,670
So now we're going to take a deep dive
into the physiology of

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,430
the parasympathetic nervous system.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,920
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,370
As we talk about parasympathetic
physiology,

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,910
I want you to keep this model in the back
of your mind.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,700
We're learning about how your body's
intrinsic capability to relax and

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,380
recover is so useful and powerful, which
becomes the foundation for

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,760
the tools we learned about in the last
video module on management tools.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,420
Of course, when stress is helpful, we
want to maximize our stress response,

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,580
which you can see in that pointy triangle
there.

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,990
But, when it's no longer productive to be
stressed,

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,960
it's absolutely necessary to activate our
parasympathetic system and transition

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,860
to a state of recovery, where we minimize
our exposure to chronic stress.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,350
So what happens to our physiology when the
parasympathetic branch is activated.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
What changes did you experience at the end
of that last video?

29
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,590
Not surprisingly, the parasympathetic
response is basically everything that

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,260
stress isn't.

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,160
When you engage in a short activity, your
heart rate slowed,

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,130
your rate of breathing went down, and your
pupils constricted.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,670
Continued parasympathetic activation means
that metabolic activity is quieted.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,990
There is reduced oxygen consumption, and
an increase in digestion and

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,770
other restorative functions.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,090
Other great things happen to your body
too.

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,390
Your thinking often becomes clear, and
it's easier to manage relationships and

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,000
social situations with increased
parasympathetic tone.

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,650
So generally speaking, it's accurate
enough to think of the sympathetic and

40
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,500
parasympathetic branches as opposing ends
of a single dial.

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,600
Like when we exercise.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,770
When we exercise, initially there's a
removal of the parasympathetic brain.

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,730
And as exercise intensity increases at
around 100 beats a minute or

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,110
so, the sympathetic system starts kicking
in.

45
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,850
That same coordination happens in the
opposite direction,

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,530
when we sit down to pray or meditate at
the end of a long day.

47
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,970
That sympathetic system previously
activated from daily stressors turns off.

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,150
And the parasympathetic system starts to
turn on.

49
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,340
But in reality the autonomic nervous
system is more nuance than just on or

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,040
off, as depicted by the diagram next to
me.

51
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,200
It allows for something called the mutual
coactivation as well as coinhibition.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,460
Of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
branches.

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,930
What this means is that it's possible to
have both branches activated at

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,480
the same time.

55
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,500
As it occurs, for example, during sexual
arousal.

56
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,990
In the case of sex, the parasympathetic
system is activated to help direct blood

57
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:01,090
flow to, well, you know where, and the the
sympathetic system.

58
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,560
Well, its job is to bring the body to
orgasm when the time is right.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,280
So, you can see that's an example where
both systems are turned on at

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,820
the same time.

61
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,200
Perhaps less interesting, but still an
important example is that

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,870
both branches can be turned off at the
same time.

63
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,730
Which happens during anesthesia, for
example.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,160
The respective branches can work in
concert with another as well as

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,340
independently of each other.

66
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,170
So how's this recovery happening in the
body?

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,080
The vagus nerve, or the 10th Cranial Nerve
deserves a big thanks for its hard work.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,030
It's often overshadowed by the glory of
the stress response.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,460
But this complex vagus nerve is incredibly
important to our survival and

70
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,100
is often wildly under-appreciated.

71
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,212
The Vagus isn't just a single bundle or
pathway.

72
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:57,101
It's a complex, multi-branched,
bidirectional nerve system.

73
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,860
What this means is that the vagus nerve
can be highly specific in the organs that

74
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,680
it innervates, and that includes afferent,
meaning ascending sensory nerves,

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,210
as well as efferent, meaning descending
motor nerves.

76
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,690
The activity of the vagus nerve can be
measured indirectly through a measure we

77
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,790
call heart rate variability.

78
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,810
As it turns out, while you may be used to
a heart rate monitor that

79
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,290
averages heart rate over 15 or more
seconds.

80
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,830
Heart rate actually varies upwards of 10
to 20 beats,

81
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,769
up and down as we breathe in and out.

82
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,420
Breathing in inhibits the activity of the
vagal communication with heart,

83
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,000
causing the heart rate to increase.

84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,000
And breathing out restores the vagal tone
and heart rate is reduced.

85
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,250
This variance in beat to beat interval is
known as heart rate variability and

86
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,470
as an indicator of vagal tone, or how
turned on does vagus system is.

87
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,966
So now that we know all about the vagus
nerve and

88
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:07,486
parasympathetic tone, let's uncover some
of the benefits that

89
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:11,010
researchers have associated with greater
vagal activations.

90
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,240
It turns out that increasing baseline
levels of vagal tone could do you a lot of

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,820
good in life.

92
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,710
For example, research suggests that higher
levels of

93
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,840
vagal tone might just make you more
compassionate.

94
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,810
Work at Stanford Center for Compassion,
Altruism, and Research, and

95
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,350
other similar organizations around the
country, have been exploring empathy and

96
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,140
compassion from a scientific prospective.

97
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,310
And vagal tone seems to be right at the
heart of it.

98
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,540
The studies beside me can be further
explored in the resource section at

99
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,180
the end of our section materials.

100
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,990
They suggest that vagal tone is an
indicator of higher compassion and

101
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,489
offering of social support.

102
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,010
It seems that somehow, the vagus plays a
role in creating an internal environment

103
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,050
that leads to a greater propensity to give
and to, to care for others.

104
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,340
Research also suggests that having more
vagal tone and

105
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,909
being more compassionate isn't just good
for those people around you.

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,840
Compassion is associated with improved
immune function and

107
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,780
is a predictor of overall health and well
being.

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,800
So it seems pretty good for you too.

109
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,890
If that isn't enough, it seems that
cultivating increase of vagal tone in

110
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,300
loving kindness meditation can improve
your ability to manage negative emotions,

111
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,190
and cause an upward spiral in positive
emotions,

112
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,800
making you feel better more often
throughout the day.

113
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,950
So here's the, the moral of the compassion
story.

114
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,910
The study of compassion is a budding field
with increase of vagal tone,

115
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,810
right at the center of the science behind
the benefits.

116
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,060
Compassion could be leading to better
immune function,

117
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,800
better social connection, and more
positive feelings.

118
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,640
I want all of those things in my life.

119
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,190
Give me some of that.

120
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,530
If I've done my job well, you're in awe of
the complexity and high degree of

121
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,910
influence that the vagus nerve has on our
physiology and on our lives.

122
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,230
How incredible is it that our bodies had
developed such a adversital and

123
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,290
effective system for dealing with so many
of our problems.

124
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,150
Lucky for us our journey doesn't end at
the appreciation of

125
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,869
the science behind parasympathetic nervous
system.

126
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,240
We're going to use this science to make
our lives better.

127
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm looking forward to seeing you in the
grandaddy of them all,

128
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,850
the stress management tool section.
