1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,890
Welcome back to the Physiology of Stress.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,080
It's finally time to put our knowledge
together, to explore some

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,130
practical tools that have the potential to
totally change your life for the better.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,460
We've had an exciting journey through the
body, and

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,220
it's time to put that little cherry on top
of our physiology knowledge.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,590
We're going to talk about three tools
commonly used to manage stress that have

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,220
been developed and well-studied by
researchers.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,170
However, keep in mind that these
techniques are just a sampling of

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,980
the unlimited number of ways to engage
your restorative Physiology.

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,610
Throughout the course of human history,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,120
we've used tools like yoga, meditation,
prayer, breathing techniques and others,

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,960
to engage this restorative system that the
techniques are, are designed to engage.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,770
Now we've chosen to highlight these few
particular tools because they

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,289
have a lot of scientific support.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,410
But that doesn't mean that there are a lot
of equally great tools out there.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,880
You have to decide which tools and
approaches work best for you.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,640
The most important thing is that you have
a set of tools that work for you.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,190
And that you use them.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,900
So let's see what these tools are and

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,610
the research that makes the argument that
they're worth using.

21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,920
Returning to our favorite science stress
model,

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,190
remember that science gives us this
nuanced understanding of stress.

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,800
Stress is absolutely and undoubtedly an
awesome thing to have in our lives.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,840
It prepares us to confront life's
obstacles by mobilizing the resources we

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,772
need to become version 2.0 of yourself.

26
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,593
A you 2.0.

27
00:01:55,593 --> 00:02:01,650
Now at the same time we know that chronic
stress is really harmful to our health,

28
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,810
and as a result there are two primary ways
we

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,620
can think about having a better
relationship with stress.

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,990
First thing, is that we can leverage
stress to work for us better.

31
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,530
That means increasing the amplitude of our
stress response to make the biggest,

32
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,900
baddest, most constructively stressed
version of ourselves that exists.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,240
The second thing we can do is when it's no
longer helpful to be stressed.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,560
It's absolutely necessary that we
transition ourselves from a state

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,240
of stress to recovery, so

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,650
that we avoid trailing off into the
chronic stress danger zone.

37
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,879
We're going to go into depth on three
tools that have scientific support.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,790
Two will be in the second category of
going from stress to recovery,

39
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,210
and because having tools to make that
transition are so

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,410
important, that's what we're going to
start with.

41
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,120
So the first of these category two
techniques that we'll touch on is called

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,420
Freeze Frame, and it's what I refer to as
an emotional approach to stress reduction.

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,960
It was created by emotion experts at
HearMath institute here in California.

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,120
We did an abridged version of this
technique to engage our bodies before

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,280
discussing the physiology of the
parasympathetic nervous system.

46
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,189
And you can see me over here doing it.

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,460
Freeze frame involves calling attention to
your heart and

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,400
solar plexus and activating a positive
feeling.

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,780
It's a technique that is designed to
replace an unproductive emotion with

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,000
a more productive one.

51
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,280
Similar to all the tools that influence us
to enter into that state of recovery,

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,070
it's associated with many of the benefits
of increasing vagal tone.

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,170
Remember, use of this tool can actually
train you to increase vagal tone, and

54
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,040
reap all the associated benefits.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,520
One important thing to note,

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,890
is that this tool is not the same as
relaxing and taking a nap.

57
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,220
It involves attention, and focus to the
steps mentioned beside me.

58
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,170
On the right side of the screen,

59
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,480
you can see the major steps to the Freeze
Frame technique.

60
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,340
At the end of the section, we'll have the
opportunity to meet one of the developers

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,349
of this technique, and learn directly from
him how to use it.

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,710
So what's so great about the research at
HearMath Institute is that it has explored

63
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,540
the lesser known but equally important
aspect of the stress experience: emotion.

64
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,455
As much as the feelings of anxiety and
frustration, or hopelessness,

65
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:52,500
are part of our experience of stress, it's
kind of amazing that many

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,190
academic conversations about stress leave
the emotional aspect out of the picture.

67
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,260
An entire field of research in emotion
physiology is exploring and

68
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,420
teaching us that the autonomic nervous
system is intimately involved and, and

69
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,380
responsive to emotional states that we
experience.

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,970
Work down at HearMath demonstrates that
positive emotional states,

71
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,450
like appreciation, increase heart rate
variability and

72
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,040
create a more optimal heart activity that
is

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,700
disrupted during negative emotional
states, like frustration.

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,130
They found that positive motions like
compassion and appreciation lead to

75
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,454
a smooth, ordered, rhythmic pattern in
heart rate variability.

76
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,680
As you can see beside me, the graph
depicts what would happen to you

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,669
if you were to employ the Freeze Frame
strategy.

78
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,240
The jagged incoherent activity is
characterized of

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,290
how the heart behaves when you're feeling
frustrated.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,382
And the smooth, sine like waves are
characteristic of how your

81
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:03,420
heart behaves when you feel appreciative.

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,570
You'll see when he does this technique on
me,

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,550
how crazy it is that changing how you feel
actually changes how your heart behaves.

84
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,890
And that by engaging your physiology with
breathing and

85
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,590
making a sincere effort to shift your
emotional state,

86
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,680
it can have a profound impact on how you
feel and how you behave.

87
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,910
It only takes a few minutes and

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,965
it can be really effective right before
taking a test.

89
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,705
Mid-fight with your boyfriend or
girlfriend, or

90
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:38,410
as a way to freeze the frame amid some
other stressful episode where you

91
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,050
might need access to better mental
resources.

92
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,650
Psychologists, military leaders and

93
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,120
personal coaches all around the world
employ this technique to shift your

94
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,850
physiology into a more productive state so
that you can perform better.

95
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,940
The bottom line is they use it because it
works.

96
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,550
The second technique is called the
relaxation response.

97
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,560
I call it a cognitive stress reduction
approach because it

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,300
attempts to reduce stress by breaking the
train of every day thinking,

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,158
minimizing those thoughts that lead to
provoking the stress response.

100
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:21,600
Created by Dr. Herbert Benson of Harvard
Medical School, the relaxation

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,410
response is a stress reduction tool
inspired by eastern traditions and

102
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,730
designed as a synthesis of the most
important elements of historical and

103
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,015
religious calming strategies.

104
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:38,330
Dr. Benson is truly an inspirational
physician, and

105
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,290
is a pioneer of mind-body medicine.

106
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,850
The relaxation response incorporates a
restful position of deep breathing,

107
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,380
with a mental device, a mantra to focus
on, and a passive attitude.

108
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,810
It's important to note that like Freeze
Frame, the relaxation response is not

109
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,400
the same as just lying down and taking a
nap or just relaxing in some other way.

110
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,160
It's an intentional, more like meditation
technique,

111
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,060
that produces benefits by breaking the
train of your scattered thought.

112
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,870
The research demonstrates that there are
immediate, short term, and long term

113
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,480
benefits associated with activating the
vagus system with the relaxation response.

114
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,075
Since the very first studies that Dr.
Benson performed on transcendental

115
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:32,830
meditators in the late 1960s, one of the
hallmark features of the relaxation

116
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,300
response is reduced oxygen consumption, a
general quieting of metabolic activity.

117
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,185
A reduction in oxygen consumption and

118
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:48,789
carbon-dioxide elimination is indicative
of what we call a hypometabolic state.

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,180
Sleep, hypnosis, hibernation.

120
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,300
Those are all examples of a hypometabolic
state.

121
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,820
Because hypometabolism is a pretty rare
state for

122
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,170
the body to be in, the ability to
cultivate a tool that can

123
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,579
place the body into a quieted state is
actually pretty profound.

124
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,470
However, what is most unique and exciting
about the work done by Benson and

125
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,310
his team at Harvard are the genomic
studies done in the most recent years.

126
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,560
Research has looked at differences of the
level of genetic expression between groups

127
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,720
of people who regularly evoke the
relaxation response and those who don't.

128
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,150
They've also done prospective experiments
looking at genetic changes in individuals,

129
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,630
who underwent two months of relaxation,
relaxation response elicitation training.

130
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,470
And lo and behold, what they found was
that the consistent use of

131
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,820
the relaxation response not only changed
your physiology in the short term,

132
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,370
it actually changes the body at the level
of genetic expression.

133
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,790
Changes in genetic expression clustered
around the four main focus hubs that

134
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,830
you can see beside me.

135
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,980
It's incredible that changing your
behavior can change the genes your

136
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,810
body expresses.

137
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,170
And even more incredible to hypothesize
what those long term benefits might be.

138
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,180
You can see the four hubs beside me.

139
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,560
The first, improve mitochondrial function.

140
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,330
It's a gene, they're gene sets linked to
energy metabolism like

141
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,670
the electron transport chain in your
powerhouse mitochondria, and

142
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,780
they were up-regulated in the long-term
group of the relaxation response.

143
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,870
It's hypothesized to increase oxidative
efficiency, and to reduce,

144
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,320
or, or to quiet oxidative stress.

145
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,870
The second hub was insulin secretion
pathways.

146
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,290
And they were up regulate, up regulated,
which has the potential for

147
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,050
positive implications for a lot of,

148
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,650
for a particularly important chronic
disease, type two diabetes.

149
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,990
The third hub, was a reduction in an
immune marker, NF kappa B,

150
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,190
which reduces systemic stress by slowing
the inflammatory cascade,

151
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,940
which means reducing inflammation in the
body.

152
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,070
The fourth major hub was that there were
changes in

153
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,760
genetic expression clustering around
telomere stabilization.

154
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,850
For those of you aren't quite familiar
with what telomeres are,

155
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,230
telomeres are the repetitive sequences
that protect the genetic material at

156
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,310
the end of the chromosome.

157
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,820
Long telomeres are associated with healthy
cells that can continue to reproduce.

158
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,460
Whereas shortened Telomeres are associated
with chronic stress and with aging.

159
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,960
The relaxation response seems to have a
stabilizing effect

160
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,340
on telomere degradation.

161
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,310
Slowing aging at the genetic level.

162
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,810
We're going to have an incredible
opportunity to speak with Dr.

163
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,180
Benson himself in the expert section of
this module,

164
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,840
where he will show us personally how to
best elicit the relaxation response.

165
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,900
Freeze Frame and the relaxation response
are two scientifically supported

166
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,310
techniques to help you transition from a
state of stress to a state of recovery.

167
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,850
If there is any place to start working on
your relationship with stress,

168
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,930
it's right here, in that number 2
category.

169
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,540
They have all sorts of benefits in the
short term and

170
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,530
the long term that scientists are just
beginning to sort out.

171
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,580
The good news is, is that by using them
you can cultivate increased vagal tone,

172
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,110
and activate the recovery system we have,
within us,

173
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,590
to reduce our exposure to chronic stress

174
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,370
[BLANK_AUDIO]

175
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,150
The good news is, is that the better you
become at transitioning to states of

176
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,320
recovery after stress, the better your
good stress will become.

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,010
Indicated, indicated here by the, the one
bubble,

178
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,200
the best thing you can do to increase good
stress is to decrease the bad stress.

179
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,200
Reducing chronic stress allows your body
to perform its natural house keeping

180
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,700
functions so that the various systems of
the body will respond optimally,

181
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,930
like a well serviced car during times of
stress, but it doesn't stop there.

182
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,790
There are other things you can do to
optimize your stress response as well.

183
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:37,080
Sleep, diet, and exercise all promote your
body's

184
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,750
ability to initiate a strong res, a strong
fortified stress response.

185
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,530
Remember, in the right situation being
stressed and physically aroused makes our

186
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,030
lives better So we can also leverage
science to amplify the stress response.

187
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,840
In addition to general health scientists
have discovered another clever way

188
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,610
to optimize this stress response by doing
this

189
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,250
fancy thing called cognitive reappraisal.

190
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,829
It's a way to make your stress response
work for you better.

191
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,990
Really, cognitive reappraisal isn't
anything more complicated than just

192
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,930
changing your belief about stress.

193
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,880
And in this case it's changing your belief
to a more positive one.

194
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,650
Alright.

195
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,830
So here's what the researchers did.

196
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,270
They brought the students who were
preparing to take the GRE.

197
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,070
And the GRE's a, a really important
graduate level exam.

198
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,220
And they brought them into the lab to take
a pretend GRE test.

199
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,270
They split them into three different
groups.

200
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,830
One group was the suppression group.

201
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,400
And they were instructed that, if they
were to feel a feeling of anxiety,

202
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,600
which makes sense that they would feel it.

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,370
They're pretty nervous about taking this
important test.

204
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,560
If they feel any anxiety,

205
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,540
they were instructed to do their best to
push that feeling of anxiety away.

206
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,760
A second group was a control group and
they were, they were left on their own.

207
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,270
They weren't instructed to do anything but
take the test.

208
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,930
And the third group, they were the
cognitive reappraisal group.

209
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,660
This special third group was instructed to
believe something different about stress.

210
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,990
They were told by the researchers that
stress was a good thing and

211
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,190
that in fact, when they feel anxiety that
means

212
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,170
their bodies are mobilizing resources in
order to be able to succeed.

213
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,040
And that in fact, that stress and anxiety
will help you perform better on the GRE.

214
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,570
Kind of miraculously, the cognitive
reappraisal group that

215
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,230
went through the intervention to develop
this more

216
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,150
positive belief about stress actually
performed better on the practice test.

217
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,090
But the real crazy thing is,

218
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,410
is that same group performed better on the
real test many weeks later.

219
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,720
A follow-up study explored a physiological
explanation for

220
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,620
how these amazing results could be
possible.

221
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,760
As we know, stress is a physical change in
the body.

222
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,230
So, how is it possible that a belief could
make a difference?

223
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,050
Well, it turns out that when we change our
belief about what stress means,

224
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,700
it not only improves our performance and

225
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,930
lowers anxiety, but it actually changes
the stress response itself.

226
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,580
The reappraisal group showed similar
patterns of stress arousal as the other

227
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,440
groups with one notable exception.

228
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,300
In comparison, the reappraisal group was
characterized by a reduction in

229
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,170
peripheral vasoconstriction.

230
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,640
The other two groups, they got stressed,
and their vessels tightened up.

231
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,450
But the reappraisal group had vessels that
were more open and relaxed Skinny type

232
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,200
vessels provide a lot of resistance to
blood that's trying to get through.

233
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,470
But relaxed more open vessels,

234
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,690
allow more nutrient enriched blood to flow
through the body.

235
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,660
What you believe about stress matters if
you want to be a high performer.

236
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,850
So it's about time that you gave yourself
the gift of a little belief makeover.

237
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,970
Preliminary research here at Stanford is
suggesting that this particular

238
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,690
intervention might be particularly helpful
for those of you who are anxiety prone.

239
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,220
Next time you're stressed, particularly if
it's a time you're about to perform say,

240
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,910
a speech, or step onto a sports field or
take a test, remember that feeling of

241
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,120
anxiety is your body's way of telling you
that it's transforming into version 2.0.

242
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,510
And it's ready to do one heck of a good
job.

243
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,870
This brings us to the end of our
incredible journey,

244
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,340
exploring stress together.

245
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,440
We've gained a deep appreciation and
understanding of the role the vagus nerve

246
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,260
and parasympathetic nervous system play in
our daily lives,

247
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,530
and what we can do to cultivate its
activation.

248
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,600
We've learned, that with just a little
vagal tone, we might just be able to be

249
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,655
more compassionate, more healthy, and
function at a higher level.

250
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:22,410
While I encourage you to experiment with
these techniques,

251
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,315
I don't want you to forget that there are
many other great ways to activate this

252
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:30,950
vagus system, and to optimize the
relationship between stress and recovery.

253
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,390
So don't be discouraged if these
particular techniques don't

254
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,760
resonate the most strongly with you.

255
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,960
The best tools are the ones that work for
you, whatever those tools are.

256
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,740
The bottom line is,

257
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,530
is that you need good strategies to
transition to recovery after stress.

258
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,350
And you would be remiss to not capitalize
on how to make stress work for

259
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,300
you instead of against you.

260
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,320
I really hope you found this module to be
instructive, practical, and entertaining.

261
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,690
Though stress is one of the biggest
challenges we face today

262
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,940
as individuals and as a society, the
exciting thing is that

263
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,470
you now have the knowledge and the tools
to take responsibility for

264
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,960
making your life better and manage stress
in a more productive way.

265
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,950
I'm so excited to see what it is that you
choose to do with this knowledge.

266
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,290
It's been a great honor to speak with you
about a topic that I'm so

267
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,190
passionate about.

268
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,780
I extend my deepest gratitude, for

269
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,880
the opportunity to share our experience
with you today.

270
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,775
Science is awesome.

271
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,330
Let's continue to use it and make our
lives better.
