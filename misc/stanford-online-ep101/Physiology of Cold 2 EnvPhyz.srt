1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,295
[LAUGH]

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:08,980
[SOUND]
>> So at that temperature of water, how

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,368
long would it have taken him to drop his
core temperature down to dangerous level?

4
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:19,480
How long could he have survived in that
tank?

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,310
>> Well to 32 degrees.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,710
Yeah it's going to be a linear drop.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,000
>> So it would have been along time?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,320
>> Yeah.
>> I mean it takes a while to get down.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,670
>> When I was in the cold bath I was, I
was not expecting that,

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,880
my body was going to be so good at keeping
my core temperature stable.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,380
>> Yeah.
>> [CROSSTALK]

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,784
>> You want a towel on your shoulders too?

13
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,260
>> It's like, you know when you're,

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,970
I've been really cold before.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,520
Like, I don't know maybe it's because I

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,540
know it's a science experiment or
something.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,120
My brain knows that I'm warm, and I'm
okay.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,890
It's observing, like I'm observing cold in
my body, but not actually cold.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,660
>> You look cold.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,240
>> Isn't this, isn't this nuts?

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,900
>> So these are the Avacore cooling and

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,880
warming devices, and so, they have warm
plates in there, and so they're,

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,140
heating the peripheral blood now and
bringing the warm blood back to the core.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,441
So this is one of the things that they
test here in the Heller Lab.

25
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:21,985
They're heart chambers here that have a
vacuum that draw blood down into his

26
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:25,717
hands, and then he has his hands resting
on the warm plates.

27
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,197
So the blood's warmed on the plates and
then goes back to his core, so

28
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:31,717
he's actually being warmed from the inside
out,

29
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,406
which is a more effective way than
traditional methods of rewarming.

30
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:39,846
>> It can be really helpful for treating
patients who have hypothermia and

31
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,006
warming them up.

32
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,610
I'm really taking advantage of the
knowledge of the body, and

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,026
how we have very dense capillary networks
in different regions of the body.

34
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:55,186
And we are able to either dump a lot of
heat, or extract heat and

35
00:01:55,186 --> 00:02:01,976
in this case primarily through my hands
but also in our face and our feet.

36
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:05,057
That's where we have these little networks
of

37
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:10,192
vessels with clamps that open up the
mastamoses that draw blood in or

38
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:14,030
prevent blood from entering these
capillary networks.

39
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,950
>> Look at how his, dark it has become.

40
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,601
You were talking [INAUDIBLE] before.

41
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,355
>> Yeah, you were.

42
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:21,110
>> Was that the not before?

43
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,480
>> You were a little bit shaky.

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,040
>> Really?
But

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,830
it's coming along, it's getting a little
bit better.

46
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,430
>> How would you like a little warm
beverage?

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,780
>> Oh I'd love it.

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,190
>> Why don't you take that hand out there?

49
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,160
>> I don't know if I can.

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,030
>> Oh.
>> [CROSSTALK] [SOUND] Thank you.

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,890
>> So we're going to give a little warm
liquid and

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,820
you have the esophageal probe and you
want to take the.

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,010
>> Oh hot chocolate, thank you.

54
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,670
>> You're welcome.
[LAUGH]

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,610
>> This is awesome.

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,190
>> Yeah, you'll want to to take

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,954
the esophageal probe out.

58
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:02,220
[NOISE]
>> You became childish.

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,840
Like you reminded me of my son when he's
small.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,805
Like you're kind of like, oh, a little
cold, trying to walk.

61
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,533
You're going through all these things that
kids usually do all the time at

62
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,042
normal temperature probably because,
they're learning them.

63
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,010
Like they don't have the muscle control.

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,360
>> Right.
>> And even the cognitive deficit is

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,580
a little bit like childishness.

66
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,290
It's like oh, making it.

67
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,360
>> Yeah, it's kind of going backward in
time a little bit.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,860
>> Yeah.
