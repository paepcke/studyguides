1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,440
And it's just an amazing experience.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,480
It's almost hard to put into words.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,350
It's both fascinating and exhilarating.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,260
>> Ken Zemach is a Senior Managing
Scientist at Exponent, Inc.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,680
an engineering, consulting company that
performs complex analysis on projects and

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,660
problems around the world.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,790
While consulting for the military in Iraq
and

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,880
Afghanistan, Ken decided it was time to
start running to get back into shape.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,160
He started running through the desert, the
machine yards and

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,380
the dust storms that never stopped.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,515
He quickly accomplished his initial goal
of running 50 miles, and

12
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,830
started looking for the next challenge.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,880
His desire to push his personal limits
eventually led him to

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,620
the Badwater UltraMarathon in Death
Valley,

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,120
considered by many to be the world's
toughest foot race.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,250
During this past summer of 2013, Ken blew
through the desert heat

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,838
in a blistering 28 hours and 37 minutes to
come in seventh overall in the race.

18
00:00:56,838 --> 00:01:01,130
Because of his stellar ability to push the
limits of human performance,

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,370
especially in the heat.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,010
It is my pleasure to welcome Ken Zemach,
as our Experiential Interviewee for

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,550
the Heat section.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,650
Thank you for joining us today.

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,620
>> Sure, my pleasure.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,060
>> So, it's a great story that you were in
Iraq.

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,795
You just decided you wanted to start
running and

26
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:19,740
then that took you to one of the most
challenging races in the world.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,130
Can you tell us a little more about that?

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,090
>> Yeah well the whole process started, I,
through working too much for

29
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,330
a couple decades and I let myself go.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,950
And woke up one day and finally said it's

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,330
it's time to actually commit to getting in
shape, losing some weight.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,020
About 35 pounds worth.

33
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,820
So obviously a lot of that was better
eating habits.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,650
And I figured I might as well just start
running.

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,930
So you know, I'd go out and run every day.

36
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,140
you know, three miles, five miles, and

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,240
ran into another contractor who had, was
training for a 50 miler.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
And I thought, well, I need a goal.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,580
If he can run 50 miles, I'll bet I can run
50 miles.

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,265
Now, remember, I've never done a marathon.

41
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:06,653
Still haven't done a marathon.

42
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,840
And so I decided that was going to be
goal.

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,554
So that would be what I would train for
while I was deployed.

44
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:17,450
I come home, I'll run a 50 miler, then
I'll hang up the running shoes, and,

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,830
you know, go back to doing whatever.

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,420
And came home, ran a 50 miler, but

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,210
I kind of already knew what was going to
happen, because while you're training for

48
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,540
a 50 miler, you, you know that the 100
milers exists.

49
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,830
And the problem is, is if you finish 50
miles.

50
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,190
Then, the real question is: Well, could
you have run a hundred miles?

51
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,810
So I ran a hundred miler.

52
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,010
Fairly pedestrian hundred miler as far as
they go.

53
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,468
It would be 7,000 vertical climbing and
descent on it.

54
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,270
>> [LAUGH]
>> As they go.

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,835
As they go.

56
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,670
And then the question became.

57
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,641
Well OK I can run a hundred miles, but can
I run a hard 100 miles.

58
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:02,401
And then off-course all of this leads
towards setting higher goals and

59
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:07,489
Badwater has both the reputation and, and
really the provides

60
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,060
the experience of something that is shall
we say on the extreme side.

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,970
>> Yeah, let's actually talk about the
Badwater.

62
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,420
So, the Badwater Ultra covers 135 miles
non-stop from Death Valley to Mt.

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,830
Whitney in California, in temperatures up
to 130 degrees Fahrenheit,

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,050
with a cumulative elevation gain of 13,000
feet.

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,720
So, that drew you.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,580
That just felt like the ultimate challenge
for you?

67
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,410
>> Yeah.

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,140
You know, you hear about it and it sounds
crazy.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,280
And then I got a chance to actually pay
somebody for it.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,170
So, you know, there's a racer will have a
support crew.

71
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,460
And so I volunteered to be on somebody's
support crew.

72
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,100
This Italian guy was coming over who
needed some Americans to help him out.

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,780
And that made it seem both all the more
crazy and yet tangible.

74
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, watching somebody actually doing
it.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,790
It's, it's an experience thats very hard
to explain.

76
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,760
But, it's very community oriented.

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,370
It's a race but it's, not really a race
like the way a triathlon is run.

78
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,710
You know, the top competitors are all
talking with each other about their

79
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,810
families and what's going on while they're
racing.

80
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,410
It's very friendly.

81
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,500
Competitive friendly.

82
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,620
And it's, it's just an amazing experience.

83
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:39,540
Its almost hard to put into words, its,
its both fascinating and exhilarating.

84
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,549
>> So you want to be part of that?

85
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:45,870
>> Oh, absolutely and I, you have that
question can I do it?

86
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,010
>> hm.

87
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,710
>> And you know, people then say why would
you do that, and I,

88
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,288
I think the response is why would you set
a goal that you know you can make.

89
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:03,180
So that what you pat yourself on the back
and then, you know, based on what?

90
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,100
Why don't you instead, set a goal that you
don't know if you'll actually succeed and

91
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,570
maybe in the process of years succeeding
or failing, you'll find something out

92
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,410
about yourself that you wouldn't have, if
you hadn't had to press yourself so hard.

93
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,900
>> So did you expect to do as well as you
did?

94
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,260
Because you came in second.

95
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,670
>> No.
>> That's pretty impressive.

96
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,305
>> I mean your place in these things is.

97
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,740
[COUGH] Excuse me.

98
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,500
There's definitely a genetic backing to
that.

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,780
You know, some people will never be,

100
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,250
you know, two thirty marathoners, no
matter how hard they train.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,630
But you reach out to whatever your genetic
potential is.

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,590
And mine is, you know, I kind get where I
fell in,

103
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,020
in the speed of running over long
distances, distribution.

104
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,220
And, you know, I was figuring on a regular
BadWater year based on how

105
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,630
people finished in other races, who've run
BadWater.

106
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,310
I'd, I'd be, you know, yeah, I could
probably break 32 hours.

107
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,960
And on a hot year, which this year
happened to be which made it

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,990
about 7 to 10 degrees hotter than your
average Badwater year.

109
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,310
I think the highest,

110
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,650
unrecorded, unofficial temperature was 125
degrees during the day, in the shade.

111
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,940
Of course, there was no shade where we
were running.

112
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,798
You add a couple of hours so by the time
we got the start I was thinking

113
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:27,262
I can break for 36 hours I'll be happy,
and I did it in a little over 28 and

114
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,657
half and a half I just, I did not know how
I did that.

115
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,283
[LAUGH]
>> While you we're running,

116
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,951
could you tell that you were doing better
than expected at each mile or

117
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,510
did you just get surprised at the end?

118
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,080
>> No.

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,670
I mean it's definitely it is a very data
intensive race.

120
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,050
Because you have a support crew with
usually two support vehicles of

121
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,940
six people.

122
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,570
You've got people who are logging your
water intake.

123
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,202
People who are logging your electrolyte
intake, your estimated calories.

124
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:58,350
Checking pace, you know, logging what
running shoes you're in,

125
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,130
how many times you're gone to the bathroom
you know, and approximate volume.

126
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,140
I mean it's, it's a very data intensive
race.

127
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,760
So I knew how fast I was going cause
actually we

128
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,599
were all a little concerned cause in any
race 50 miles and up.

129
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,660
In the beginning it feel good because you
always feel good.

130
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,240
because you go in so slow, that how can
you not feel good.

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,500
So everyone there is a tendancy to run too
fast in these things.

132
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,745
In the beginning you're like I feel great,
of course you feel great,

133
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:29,555
you're like on mile 20, you know.

134
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:34,200
[LAUGH] So, you know, how you going to
feel about 60 or 80 or 110.

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,380
So there was a little concern that I was
going to fast.

136
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,230
And I just had to go what I feel.

137
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,980
One thing I did was I'm a bit of a data
geek.

138
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,990
So I wore a heart rate monitor.

139
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,230
And I always wear a heart rate monitors
when I train.

140
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,590
Heart rate monitor is probably one of the
better objective measures that

141
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,120
you can use for effort.

142
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,000
obviously, it's not a direct measure of
muscular versus cardiovascular effort, but

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,040
it's a pretty good guess.

144
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,190
Now, what I didn't know is, would it work
with the stress that you experience in

145
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,500
the heat, and I just had to take it on
faith that it would.

146
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,350
So, I basically ran, and tried to keep my
heart rate below a certain level.

147
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,570
The whole time I ran and, and

148
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:22,020
then use that as my, as my metric for not
letting adrenaline and,

149
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,990
to be fair, testosterone keep you from,
from over exerting yourself.

150
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,120
And it worked.

151
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,710
I was, I was quite surprised.

152
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,400
>> Yes, that's very impressive.

153
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,450
So what was the most challenging element
of the race?

154
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,320
>> Of the race, well,

155
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,655
I would say the most challenging element
of the race was the training for the race.

156
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,770
[LAUGH] It was brutal, but we can talk
about that later.

157
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:55,270
The, the race, I, I think the most
challenging element is, well,

158
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,820
there's, there's the physical stuff which
is certainly a heap.

159
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,770
I mean, it feels like your body won't
lasts for us.

160
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,790
It really does.

161
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,540
I mean it is just you know,

162
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,200
you have soaked the sleeves of your shirt
with the water.

163
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,950
Ice water you know every time you got a
crew change out or something.

164
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,940
And they, they'd just be dry you know for
minutes.

165
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,580
If you, and your arms would just be hot.

166
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
And your face is hot.

167
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,010
So there's certainly physically.

168
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,320
It was hot.

169
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,860
I think the heat was certainly bad.

170
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,920
So one of the more challenging parts,
though, was, you know,

171
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,050
to race like this, you have to be really
careful that nothing goes wrong.

172
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,610
because when things start to go wrong and

173
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,890
cascade, it's very difficult to recover
from that.

174
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,950
Let's say you're running a 10 mile race.

175
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,280
And your knee starts to tweak.

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,828
Mile eight, and partly finish.

177
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,830
If you're in a 100 mile race and

178
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,970
your knee tweaks at mile 80, you're in a
lot of trouble.

179
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,260
And so the problem in Badwater isn't just,
you know, oh, you know,

180
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,147
my stomach's a little upset like it was in
that other, you know, 20 miler I ran.

181
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:02,760
You know so I ate a few, a little few
gels, or whatever.

182
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,350
You know, Badwater, at hour five.

183
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,990
If your stomach start to feel a little
upset, it might not be a big deal.

184
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,360
But if it becomes a big deal, it's a big,
massive deal.

185
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
It can be a showstopper.

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,230
So, managing, all of the little things
you're feeling.

187
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,270
Of course, then you start getting these
self fullfilling prophacies.

188
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,270
And these you, you, over analyze things,
you know.

189
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,500
Oh, for a while, I thought I was getting a
blister on one of my heels.

190
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,530
So, I immediately stopped.

191
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,440
I got to take care of this blister.

192
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,190
I took off my shoe.

193
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,370
Three of my crew, are physical therapists.

194
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,100
Ones a Veterinary Surgeon and the other
was a vet.

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,140
And, so they look at me and go, there's
nothing wrong with you.

196
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,530
[LAUGH] Oh no, I feel, I feel, I'm getting
a blister.

197
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm getting a blister.

198
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,330
They're like, you're not getting a
blister.

199
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,900
And then as I'm putting on my socks both
my legs cramp up and like I can't walk.

200
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,170
And, you know, it's just.

201
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,260
You know, it's like is this a good cramp
or bad cramp?

202
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,530
Am I going to be able to get over this
one?

203
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,216
And you just.

204
00:10:55,216 --> 00:11:00,270
It's, it's, it's, it's this constant
massaging of how are you feeling.

205
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,800
Yeah, I'll tell friends when I go out for

206
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,220
a long run and you say oh, I'm happy I ran
100 miles, I ran 135 miles.

207
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,109
And then he'll say God, you must be so
bored, what do you think about?

208
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,690
And it is anything but boring, because if
you, if you come along somebody at,

209
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,650
you know, mile eighty, and let's say they
don't have their pacer with them.

210
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,580
You can come over, and you're, they're
racing.

211
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,720
You have a conversation with them, you
know.

212
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,780
And the conversation will be for, you
know, a good five minutes, and

213
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,650
I'd be like, look, can, can you shut up?

214
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,300
Because I've got a lot going on.

215
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm trying to look at my pace, I'm trying
to see how my heart rate's going.

216
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,780
You know, I'm really busy.

217
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,800
And especially these trail hundred milers.

218
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,020
They're different from Badwater because
you're on an open road, but

219
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,800
a trail hundred miler.

220
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,130
You, you are mentally taxed to the limit
by hour fifteen.

221
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,000
Because you're tired.

222
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,350
You know, might be 3 am.

223
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,990
You, you've got ten more hours to go or
it's going to get lost.

224
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,520
How's that heel?

225
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,180
Or are you taking in enough calories.

226
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,190
The next aid station is coming up.

227
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,390
How many calories are you going to take
there?

228
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,880
How much are you going to refill your
water.

229
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,240
Oh, how's your pace doing?

230
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,810
Oh, and how's that other ankle feeling.

231
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,290
Oh, have you checked in on your knee
lately.

232
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,430
How's your heart rate going?

233
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,270
You know and you're just.

234
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,290
>> Be careful of the trail, through the
rough section.

235
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,028
>> Yeah, ex, exactly, what do you have, do
you have a rough?

236
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:11,874
[LAUGH] Alright, so,

237
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:15,130
Same thing with Badwater although you
don't have the problem with getting lost.

238
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,230
If you get lost there, you're in a lot of
trouble.

239
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:20,500
You're actually really busy.

240
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,580
And you're busy because there is not only
is there a lot to do,

241
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,550
but you're mental faculties start to go.

242
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,660
>> So what were you wearing, and is it
true that you're shoes melt on,

243
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,120
on the pavement?

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,700
>> Yeah, so there's, there's a lot of lore
about Badwater.

245
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,090
Some of which is true, some of which is
probably not true, and

246
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,050
some of which I think depends.

247
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,920
You know, if there is a the, people have
said that, it's so

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,720
hot you have to run on the white line or
your shoes will melt.

249
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,440
>> you, perfect.
>> That's not true.

250
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,920
Now what is true,

251
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,230
according to some longtime veterans is
some of the earlier shoes, the the glue

252
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,670
that laminates the layers together was,
not thermaset and that would melt

253
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,120
until they'd literally get delamination
with the sole or the bottom of the shoe.

254
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,950
And I've heard that some of the insoles
would actually start sticking like

255
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,960
they weren't using full cured rubber.

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,310
However the shoe manufacture would make
them.

257
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,050
Those would stick to the socks.

258
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,840
You know, you peel them off the socks.

259
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,170
But, you know, you don't have to run on
the white line.

260
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,130
You could run on the black asphalt.

261
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,526
Now the black asphalt could be 190 degrees
farenheight, right?

262
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,095
I mean.

263
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,215
It's hot or [CROSSTALK].

264
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:32,714
>> You feel that heat coming up.

265
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,458
>> Yeah.

266
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,620
Oh, it is just
>> In your calves.

267
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,420
>> It is.

268
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,520
So miserably hot it's unbelievable.

269
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,200
And you don't just lay on the ground.

270
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,820
You get off the road.

271
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,750
And it's, it's just brutally hot.

272
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,760
Yeah, you know, there's just, there's
there's just some things about

273
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,460
Badwater event that that are, are so
unique.

274
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,920
I mean, first of all there's just the
brutal temperature.

275
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,760
They start everybody in three waves based
on what they predict your speed will be.

276
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,150
6 AM, 8 AM and 10 AM.

277
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,090
They start the slow people, slower people,
slow.

278
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,960
Nobody's really fast, either, in this kind
of race.

279
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,390
But start, people who are going to take
longer at 6:00 am,

280
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,670
and then the faster ones at 10:00 a.m.

281
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,460
I've got a 10:00 a.m.

282
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,290
start.
The point of that is not just to

283
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,850
spread it out.

284
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,290
So you don't have a giant bobble, on the
road.

285
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,190
It's, it's to make sure that everybody
runs.

286
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,620
This must be the hottest part of Death
Valley,

287
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,290
the hottest part of the day, the hottest
time of the year.

288
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,670
>> Well, that's nice of them, put that in
there.

289
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,560
>> It's very considerate.

290
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,930
Well, I mean, you wouldn't want to feel
cheated.

291
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,690
>> Right.
>> You know.

292
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,650
>> You're pushing your limits.

293
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,570
You may as well really go for it.

294
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,098
>> Yeah, people say well, come on.

295
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,211
It's so stupid to run it in the middle of
July.

296
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,124
You know, why don't you run it in
December?

297
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,960
It's like, well then, why not run it on an
air-conditioned treadmill.

298
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,890
I mean, you know.
>> Then it

299
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,220
wouldn't be the toughest race around.

300
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
>> [LAUGH] Then, then, what's the point?

301
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,620
You know,.

302
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,800
You know, so, you do that, you start off
and it's just so hot.

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,380
And then you get, then you get to start
going up hill.

304
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,390
And the first hill you get to, Town Pass,

305
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,650
I can't remember how long it is, something
like 15 miles up hill.

306
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,430
If you can.

307
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,200
Anywhere between five and 13 degrees slope
and the thing is this happens usually for

308
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,250
everybody around when its dark again, when
it's getting close to night.

309
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,400
So you're climbing at least it's not that
hot when you're climbing.

310
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,140
Most people are, you know, you're speed
hiking it or

311
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,825
power hiking it as the [INAUDIBLE] like to
call it.

312
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,420
But the way that Death Valley is,

313
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,960
as it sets up these thermal winds that are
picking the heat.

314
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,500
And I am not kidding.

315
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,240
And ev-, it is at least.

316
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,920
And I've done a lot of sailing, so I'm
pretty good at estimating this.

317
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,720
It is at least an average of 25 mile an
hour wind in

318
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,640
your face the entire way up this pass.

319
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,510
So you don't even get to a little place
where it would be flat.

320
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,490
And you try and run and

321
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,710
it's just, it's such diminishing returns
because the, the head wind is so strong.

322
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,590
There's no point in even running.

323
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,340
And it is just blasting you.

324
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,222
Somebody had given me a very good tip, a,
a veteran who had run before.

325
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:05,730
He said, make sure your whole crew and you
have clear safety glasses.

326
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,710
>> Mmhmm.
>> Why?

327
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,990
Now some people wore sunglasses.

328
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,780
That's the start of the day.

329
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,580
Obviously if it's sun and the reflection
why would i need clear glasses for night?

330
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,480
Why?

331
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,930
Because of the wind.

332
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,130
And they were not kidding.

333
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,340
It's like, it's and then when, you know
sand and dust would blow up in it.

334
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,000
It was like being hit with a sandblaster,
but sandblaster and the blast hurts.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,720
It was just, you know, and, and you don't
think you'd be.

336
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,560
You know, you're passing somebody or

337
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,950
somebody passing you not very quickly of
course and you just look at them.

338
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,730
It's like I, I can't run.

339
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,850
And I'm like nobody can run.

340
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,070
>> What did you do for food and drink
during the race for that 27 hours?

341
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,290
>> So, Yeah.

342
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,830
So, obviously you, you churn some long
hours and you've done a lot of races.

343
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,830
Nobody even gets to enter this race.

344
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,120
Can't even apply to the race unless you
run at least three hundred milers.

345
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,460
That's the minimum qualifying stance.

346
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,500
Everybody whose has done this is towing
the line, has run for

347
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,440
at least 20, 24 hours before.

348
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,330
So you kind of know how your stomach is
probably going to handle food.

349
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,719
And you know, there's a popular you know,
a lot of people who take these gels.

350
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah it's an efficient form of energy.

351
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,150
Well, yeah they don't taste so bad.

352
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,950
But you try eating gels after 7 hours, oh
and

353
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,850
by the way 7 hours you just started, kay.

354
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,060
After 7 hours of gels, you know,

355
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,460
those things do not taste like a fun snack
anymore.

356
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,260
It's not like people go home, they look in
their cabinet and go oh a gel.

357
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,980
I think I'll have a snack.

358
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,290
They're already bad enough as they are.

359
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,770
So you basically bring a wide variety of
foods.

360
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,450
This is compounded, you know, by the heat.

361
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,350
Because as you all know.

362
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,270
As anybody who's been in that really hot
sun is not that hungry.

363
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,790
But you've gotta eat.

364
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,460
So but you don't want to force feed
yourself cause you don't want to throw up.

365
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,420
But if you're not eating regularly you
will balk.

366
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,940
You will not finish.

367
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,930
So what did I eat?

368
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,480
Well I brought what I thought I could eat
which was a mixture of gels and

369
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,570
this this stuff called [INAUDIBLE] made by
a particular component which is

370
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,270
a maltodextrin mix that isn't too sweet
tasting.

371
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,230
And then it was, you know, gore up with
salt,

372
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,980
nuts and raisins and different bars.

373
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,666
And then you know, different things start
to taste good.

374
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,366
We had cheese pizza.

375
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:30,324
[INAUDIBLE] At one point [INAUDIBLE]
cheese pizza said we out and

376
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:33,778
drove into town and got a cheese pizza and
think, wait run in the heat.

377
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:34,675
How can you eat cheese pizza.

378
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,174
You'd be shocked.

379
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:39,390
Cheese pizza is really good while you're
running.

380
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,247
No kidding.

381
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,216
[LAUGH]

382
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:45,213
>> Yeah I worked once at the Western
States 100, one of the aid stations.

383
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:47,267
And they had the most bizarre foods there.

384
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,251
People would just come by and

385
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:49,571
crave everything
>> Oh.

386
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:53,089
>> From, you know, pizza to peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

387
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,347
Everything, just wild.
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

388
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:57,925
Burritos and actually, my girlfriend is
the inventor of the Ensure smoothie.

389
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,765
So, she used to work at an aid station
and,

390
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:05,593
basically it's Ensure which is a great
thing for an ultra-runner to be eating,

391
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:09,444
but mix in with fruit in a blender, and I
can share some of these.

392
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:14,384
Did a lot of soup, you know, because it's
a good way, it's salty, it's got, sort of,

393
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:18,609
it negates the sweet that you've been
pounding down the first ten hours, and

394
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,819
obviously it's got a lot of liquid, and

395
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,591
you can get some calories in that way
without throwing up usually.

396
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:25,940
I was lucky.

397
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,780
I have a fairly cast iron stomach, but a
lot of these people throw up a lot.

398
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,960
And, you know, when you start getting
nauseous, or most upset,

399
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,390
it's just, you know, just get it out,
reset the clock, start eating again.

400
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,664
You know, as long, as long as you're
getting calories in.

401
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:45,070
You know, that's better than, you know, to
not be too cruddy, but

402
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,090
some people get the runs.

403
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,800
You know, that, if you're not digesting
well.

404
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,170
And that, I've never had that, but that
just sounds miserable.

405
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,420
>> So you said the training was some of
the hardest, or the most uncomfortable.

406
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,130
What, what was the training?

407
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,840
>> Yeah.
So, maybe it's different for

408
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,000
veterans of this race.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,990
But, your first time into this race, you
know?

410
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,540
You may not get, its, it's very.

411
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,310
Unde, ill-defined selection process so if
you get selected which is rare.

412
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,880
I got lucky.

413
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,642
I don't know what it was about my essay.

414
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:16,120
They want a whole series of essays in
addition to the qualifying standard.

415
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,009
>> [LAUGH]

416
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,190
>> Oh, oh yeah, it's, it, you know, I
probably spent three days on mine.

417
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,110
It's like I spent more time on my essay
for

418
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,477
Badwater than I did on my grad school
application.

419
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:26,220
Right?

420
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,891
>> [LAUGH]

421
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:32,930
>> And it, so you get in it and then
you've got one shot at this.

422
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,090
And even if you finish, you might not get
invited back.

423
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,760
So, you really don't want to screw this
up.

424
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:50,810
And it costs a lot of money and you've
gotta put a lot of training in.

425
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,810
And we all know how to train for a 100
miler.

426
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:59,960
And 135, while it is longer than 100
miles, is not that significantly longer.

427
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,400
It's the heat of Badwater and

428
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,450
can my, what are my joints going to do
after 135 on the pavement.

429
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,809
Less stress on the ankles from not being
on rough running trails.

430
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:18,200
More stress from the repetitive unchanging
impact.

431
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,930
So if you have one little tweak, it's
going to get tweaked every single time.

432
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,340
But it's the heat trend is really what
it's about.

433
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,970
How are you going to perform in that kind
of heat,

434
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,010
especially if you live in the San
Francisco Bay area like I do

435
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,750
where it's just, it just doesn't have heat
training.

436
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,270
People take, generally take two approaches
to the heat training.

437
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,220
Well, people try the third.

438
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,510
The third is, there is always the option
of do nothing.

439
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,470
Right?
>> That sounds like a bad idea.

440
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,452
>> Yeah, that generally

441
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,520
>> [LAUGH]
>> People have said,

442
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,786
does not work out very well.

443
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,170
People finish that one.

444
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,700
But they, they don't have a lot of fun.

445
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,270
And fun, in quotes.

446
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,531
>> Mm-hm.

447
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:57,710
>> So, people take two general approaches.

448
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,780
And a lot of this is invariably community.

449
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,300
We share stuff, and some people research,
other people what works for them.

450
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,760
Its also very anecdotal for them.

451
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,990
The two methods are either actively
training or passively training.

452
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,580
Active heat training is you know, your put
on a buddy suit or

453
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,500
a Tyvek suit or a winter coat, hat and
gloves in the middle of the summer, and

454
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,020
you know all your ski gear and you go
running.

455
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,200
Or you get on a treadmill and put a dryer
vent on you.

456
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,650
Or you, you know,

457
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,920
put a treadmill in a sauna or you put a
stationery bike in a sauna.

458
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,530
A lot of people do, you know, the hot
yoga, although that's not very hot, so

459
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:43,044
I don't know unfortunately how that works,
but, it's not for that level of training.

460
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,930
So, and, and, that is probably, you can
argue that is

461
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,900
the best approach because you're actually
training in that hot temperature.

462
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,380
There's a different school of thought,
which is the one I bought into,

463
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,140
which is, yes, that's probably better for
you adaptation to heat.

464
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,350
If you exercise in the heat,

465
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,435
you better replicate what your body's
going to be going through.

466
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:06,638
Both physically and mentally.

467
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,970
But, your training will suck.

468
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,090
So remember, you don't just have to
survive in the heat.

469
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,510
You actually have to run hard for five
months.

470
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,510
So, you need to be able to get enough
training in, at a good enough pace, with

471
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:28,140
enough pounding, and enough repetition, to
be able to run 135 miles irregardlessly.

472
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,008
So, once, with this school of thought is,

473
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,590
separate your heat training from your
regular training.

474
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,320
Train, do your regular running.

475
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,970
The morning or, you know, early evening.

476
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,350
Your heat training is passive training,
afterwards.

477
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,920
What I mean by passive training.

478
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,541
I mean, go to a sauna.

479
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,349
There's a guy that's actually from Napa
who's developed what he

480
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,076
calls his protocol for passive heat
training.

481
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,837
And everyone just seems to follow him.

482
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:57,237
Let's face it, he's finished Badwater ten
times and

483
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:01,462
you know, ran it in like 32 hours at age
70 and I think that's crazy.

484
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:04,331
So, cause, cause I'm mean.

485
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:09,096
And [LAUGH] well, I'm 44, It's not bad.

486
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,438
I, yes, it's crazy.

487
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:14,530
And so he has this protocol list
developed, and you start off.

488
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,480
You know, start off easy, it's a three
week protocol.

489
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,700
Go into the sauna, every single day and it
increases in time and

490
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,130
it increases in temperature.

491
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,430
Just keep upping the sauna temperature.

492
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,685
It starts off and you look at it in the
beginning.

493
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:29,830
Like that's going to be easy.

494
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:35,390
You know, it's like, 140 Fahrenheit for 15
minutes.

495
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,040
It's, yeah, whatever.

496
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,200
You know, I'm, I'm good in the heat, I
spent time overseas, you know, I'm,

497
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,950
I'm, I've run, you know, in Iraq.

498
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,760
I've, you know, in the middle of the day.

499
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,050
It's, It's maybe 115 there, no problem,
it's, who cares.

500
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm good.
It's, it's been a long time since I've

501
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,130
been in Iraq, so, get in the sun, I'm
like, yeah I'll.

502
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,850
Let's do 25 minutes at about 140.

503
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,170
Well, at five minutes, no problem.

504
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,310
Seven minutes it's definitely hot, I'm
starting to sweat, but

505
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,470
clearly I basically haven't saturated, you
know my body's ability to, you know,

506
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,970
I've reached that steady state of trying
to get heat out and keep the core cool.

507
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,250
And around I don't know, nine minutes.

508
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,560
Oh my god I'm going to die.

509
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,916
And I mean 15 minutes and I was, I maybe
crawled out of there at 17 minutes.

510
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:28,020
And, I joined a gym to get access to a
sauna and I get out and

511
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,600
I just lay down on the bathroom floor of
the men's bathroom.

512
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,060
And even there were a few, like three
people walk by, sir are you okay?

513
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,130
Yeah I'm fine, I was just in the sauna.

514
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,261
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> They're like should be call somebody.

515
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:42,290
Of course this happens every time for the
next month.

516
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,260
>> This is the last question,

517
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,470
so what take home message do you want to
give to our students for watching this.

518
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,640
Maybe you just gave it but.

519
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,020
>> Well I don't know.

520
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,980
I would give.

521
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,230
Well.

522
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,460
Two, two take home messages.

523
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,760
It's going to be lengthy.

524
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,140
But the first one I found very interesting
with the heat and

525
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,150
I'm sure you'll talk about this in the
classroom from a technical standpoint.

526
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,490
Doing the heat training before the race I
noticed that my run,

527
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,940
I was just running faster.

528
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,620
Like just day to day.

529
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,780
Same heart rate.

530
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,720
You know, we're wearing a heart rate
monitor, same effort.

531
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,640
I was just faster, I guess that's the
plausibility of it.

532
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,550
Just for varying, granted the heat turns
awful,

533
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,120
it was just so hard, but time wise, you
know, hour in the day about,

534
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,530
a little bit of laying on the couch
afterwards moaning softly to myself, but.

535
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,580
You know?
The heat training, while miserable,

536
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,670
was fairly short.

537
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,100
And I saw massive improvements in my
running.

538
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,450
Way more than an extra hour of running
would have helped, or

539
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,400
weight training, or really, anything.

540
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,519
So, one is sort of an athletic takeaway,
which is.

541
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,130
I question why more people in any athletic
pursuit do not make

542
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,770
heat training a part of their training.

543
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,690
Because for one, you know, one hour a day,
which takes a lot of time,

544
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,800
but the benefits massively outweigh an
extra hour of

545
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,830
training in whatever your sport is.

546
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,860
The question, of course, then is where is
the point of declining benefits.

547
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,540
And then how often do you have to go,

548
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,290
once you reach that plateau to keep at
that plateau?

549
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,830
Do you only need to go to sauna once a
week?

550
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,430
Twice a week?

551
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,140
Three times a week?

552
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,300
Once a month?

553
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,280
And what does it take to, to prod your
physiological system to get,

554
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,960
to keep that adaptive response I don't
know.

555
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,770
The person who figures that out is going
to figure out the least time method for

556
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,632
optimizing physical performance and a
whole host of sports.

557
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:47,263
And I think there's serious untapped
potential there.

558
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,960
There's a research project.

559
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,182
So, the second thing.

560
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:52,880
>> You heard it here first.

561
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,960
>> I'm patenting it.

562
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
Silicone Valley.

563
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,380
[LAUGH] So the second thing is, I, I would
say and

564
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,010
I mean, I kind of touched on this in the
beginning.

565
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,320
And it's got nothing to do with running or
whatever it is or

566
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,940
whether you can disagree or.

567
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,838
You know, I think as you're learning in
this course,

568
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:10,390
your students are learning in this course.

569
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,540
The human body is an amazing machine and
its adaptive process to any number of

570
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,710
environments, except maybe cold, but you
can argue with me.

571
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,640
It's, it's phenomenal how much your body
will change to stimulus, response,

572
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,690
stimulus, response.

573
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,000
Remember the stimulus is the one that
makes you

574
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,910
stronger as the stimulus recovery
response.

575
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,890
I mean, you've got recover to,

576
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,220
you know, go weight train, you're actually
weaker, gotta wait, then you're stronger.

577
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,461
It's that response thing.

578
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,455
So you're learning in this class that,

579
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:44,210
the human body has a phenomenal amount of
tension.

580
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:50,300
And, it also works best intellectual,
physically,

581
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,900
when it is stressed within a stress and
response, you know,

582
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,720
as long as that stress isn't exceeding the
the adaptation rate.

583
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,850
I think that people in Western, and people
today in the world,

584
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,840
we just have people who have lost the
ability to set goals that are,

585
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,670
that are hard enough.

586
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,470
To maximize that gap with response.

587
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,750
And I think we're cheating ourselves in
terms of regardless of what it is.

588
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,930
And people say, oh my god, you ran 135
miles.

589
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,850
That's crazy.

590
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,896
Well, is it crazy?

591
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:30,130
I mean, I, I don't remember what the
number is but

592
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,490
it was only a couple of decades ago, women
weren't allowed to race in

593
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,130
most marathons because they were
physically incapable to run a marathon.

594
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,310
I mean are you freaking kidding me.

595
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,920
This is a, practically well I'm old, but
this is like my lifetime practically.

596
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,640
Women couldn't compete in like Olympic
marathons.

597
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,700
There was no women's Olympic marathon
cause women were too weak.

598
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,780
Well we all know that is ridiculous.

599
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,469
Women can run 135 miles as well as a guy.

600
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,370
Okay.

601
00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:02,940
So clearly society's view of what's normal
it's probably a little to conservative.

602
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,490
And so my take away message would be A:
probably set harder goals for yourself.

603
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,660
Realistic goals.

604
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,750
In terms of, you know,

605
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,490
don't say oh I'm going to run, you know, a
100 miles tomorrow.

606
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,430
You know, you try, but I don't want you to
get hurt but, but, you know, you need to

607
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,400
set harder, I think we can set a lot
harder goals regardless of what it is.

608
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,260
And then the second part of it is that
there is something to be said.

609
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,310
Once you understand what it is that you're
reaching for.

610
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,760
Whether it's in science or whether it's in
humanities or,

611
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,220
or doing good world wide, or on some
physical pursuit.

612
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:47,540
Set a goal that you don't know you can
actually succeed at you know.

613
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,530
And, and fail.

614
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,700
You might learn something.

615
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,760
>> This is a great place to end, or maybe
succeed.

616
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,624
>> Maybe, don't know yet, you haven't, you
haven't aired it yet.

617
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:02,512
>> Thank you so much.

618
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,175
>> Absolutely, thanks for having me.

619
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:14,175
