1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,650
>> You'll be in a a setting that, it seems
death-like, you know,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,780
it seems like a grave or, it's so quiet
and so cold.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,860
But yet you're in your own bubble of
warmth, and

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,480
you can just move freely through it and,
and feel really awake and alive.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,370
>> Jill Homer, a freelance writer and

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,140
adventure racer has a resume that includes
some of the world's most prestigious and

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,120
difficult cold weather, ultra endurance
events.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,860
Since moving to Alaska in 2005 to work as
a newspaper editor, she has used races

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,790
such as the Alaska Susitna 100, Homer Epic
100k, White Mountains 100, and the 350

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,340
mile Iditarod Invitational to test her
mental and physical limits of performance.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,550
Both on foot and on a bike.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,998
Ultra endurance events can push the limits
of human tolerance by distance alone.

13
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:51,870
But throw in isolation, temperatures as
low as 50 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit,

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,808
partially frozen waterways and no support
crew and you have the potential for

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,460
life- threatening disasters at any moment.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,330
Jill has learned first hand how to
understand and respect the cold.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,220
For these reasons, and many more, it is my
great pleasure to welcome Jill Homer for

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,050
Experiential Interview on the Physiology
of Cold.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,390
Jill, thank you for taking the time to
meet with us today.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,190
>> Thank you for having me.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,220
>> so, I understand that you didn't even
own a bike until your early 20s.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,130
So how did you go from that to adventure
racing on a bike?

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,900
>> Well, I as a youth I did hiking.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,050
I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,390
So I was a pretty avid hiker and turned
that to backpacking.

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,650
And then later decided to try bicycle
touring, traveling by bicycle,

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,420
which is really when I took up bicycling
was to start doing this traveling.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,630
And then in 2005, I was 25 years old, and
moved to Homer, Alaska to take a job at

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,890
a newspaper, and also because I wanted the
adventure of going to live in Alaska.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,400
But I moved up there in September, and
thought oh the, you know,

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,930
the long winter is coming, and I really
need something to get me outdoors.

32
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,280
And considered skiing, but

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,462
then I discovered that people in Alaska
also ride bikes on snow in the winter.

34
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:05,920
Which seemed very intriguing to me, and
through that,

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,290
I discovered this race called the Susitna
100.

36
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,900
Which, I looked at the photos, and it
looked like such a great race, you know?

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,720
And the only caveat was I had never raced
anything before, and

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,900
this was 100 miles in the winter in
Alaska.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,980
So, I signed up for it, and even my
boyfriend at the time thought I was crazy.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,010
It's like where did that come from?

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,720
You're not really a competitive person.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,640
You're not an athlete.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,630
Really?
I mean, you like to ride bikes.

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,900
But I thought that having this goal would
keep me going outside in the winter.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,170
I'd have to go out and train every day.

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,920
And that was appealing to me to have
something forcing me to do this even when

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,650
it was 20 below out or windy or snowing.

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,010
So, I ws really excited about riding my
bike in this race, the Susitna 100.

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,710
And that was February 2006, was that race.

50
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,520
That was my first.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,450
>> Were you hooked?

52
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,950
>> I was hooked.

53
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,190
It was very, very hard.

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,180
And it was life changing.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
>> But you made it?

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,030
>> I made it.

57
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,280
I finished, yes.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,449
It took me 25 hours.

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,250
A lot of that was walking because at the
time I didn't have,

60
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,760
they have specialized fat tire bikes that
are made for riding on snow.

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,230
At the time I didn't have one, I just had
a regular mountain bike.

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,700
And that was a uniquely warm year in the
race, and

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,220
there was a big rainstorm, turned all the
snow to slush.

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,790
And then I could no longer,

65
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,210
my wheels couldn't get purchase on top of
the snow so I had to walk about 30 miles.

66
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,820
And I was drenched and, and I was
hypothermic because I was cold and

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,730
it was 35 degrees or so.

68
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,570
It was, I was wet and it was cold.

69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,180
But I was just determined.

70
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,530
I'm going to finish this race.

71
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,860
I'm not going to hop, you know, the snow
machine sweeper was going by.

72
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,870
Like, do you need help?

73
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,420
But I'm, no, I'm going to finish, so, I
did, and I was, it was great.

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,340
I was
>> So, you were in Alaska, so

75
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,090
you were doing cold events then, but now,
you live in a warmer climate, and

76
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,650
yet, you're still drawn to these cold
events.

77
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,230
>> Oh, yeah.

78
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,070
>> So, why the cold?

79
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,958
Why is that so appealing to you?

80
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,600
>> Well, I mean, this probably sounds
insincere, coming from someone who lives

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,980
in the Bay area, which prob'ly has the
friendliest climate in the United States.

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,840
And I love it here, but cold is really my
favorite weather.

83
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,130
I really, every year we take these trips
to Alaska.

84
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,310
I really look forward to them.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,490
And I think the reason I like cold so

86
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,370
much, is the way it just changes the whole
environment.

87
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,680
I mean, when you get sub-zero
temperatures, the air become very clear.

88
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,600
It becomes very silent.

89
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,990
I've been out where I've heard it, about
20 below, and I've heard footsteps on, and

90
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,780
I'd be in this wide open plain, and you
can't see the creature that's walking.

91
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,670
It's probably a half mile away, but I can
hear it like it's right next to me.

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,426
And, you get this tingle in the ear from
the ice crystals that

93
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,880
sound like tiny little bells ringing next
to your ears.

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,240
And, in the winter, you get that low angle
sun, which casts long shadows and

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,350
the great colors.

96
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,549
It's just really a magical place.

97
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,990
And not many people experience that, like
not many people go out into the cold.

98
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,430
And so it's just kind of like you have
this whole world all to yourself and

99
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,740
it's beautiful icy white, you know,
heaven-like setting.

100
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,770
And I love having the freedom to move
through the cold.

101
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,710
I mean, you'll be in a setting that, it
seems deathlike.

102
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,880
You know, it seems like a grave or it's so
quiet and so

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,120
cold, but yet you're your own bubble of
warmth and

104
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,770
you can just move freely through it and
feel really awake and alive.

105
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,440
So, I love it.

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
>> That's beautiful.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,020
Makes me want to go do it.

108
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,250
>> Yeah I agree.

109
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,250
I, you know, I, I miss it.

110
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
I miss not living in Alaska.

111
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,110
I love living here for lots of reasons,
but it's a sacrifice in other ways.

112
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,635
>> So, you love being in the environment,
but you add on this

113
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:04,990
ultra-endurance component to it, as well,
which adds all sorts of new challenges.

114
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,730
So, how do you prepare, when you're
getting ready for

115
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,790
an event of that distance, where you have
no support crew, and

116
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,950
you're going to be in temperatures down to
50 below zero?

117
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,490
>> Well, I mean the most important thing
is having the right gear.

118
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,120
And it's always nice to test out new gear.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,310
We don't get many opportunities here,

120
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,110
but just having all the survival gear you
need, all the warm clothing you need.

121
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,750
Knowing that that works well for you.

122
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,570
That, in a way, is more important than
being physically fit.

123
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,790
Although it is very important to be
physically fit as well,

124
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,300
you need to not get so tired that you
can't go on.

125
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,025
And you need to be mentally focused on the
task at hand.

126
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,960
Because you're going to be, I mean, there
are times when it's just very scary.

127
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,900
And, there's, a, you know, a really strong
urge to bailout in anyway possible.

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,310
>> And how often are you completely alone
in these situations?

129
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,820
>> We'll it's really up to you.

130
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,140
I mean a lot of times in these races,
there aren't many people involved but

131
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,360
people do team up and travel together.

132
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,300
They make the decision.

133
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,918
In the races I do I generally chose to be
alone.

134
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,250
I just like doing my own thing and

135
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,810
often times it just hasn't worked out for
me to travel with another person.

136
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,090
Although the year that I first
raced,Susitna 100 on foot in 2011,

137
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,910
Bayad and I did it together and decided to
travel together the whole time.

138
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,220
>> And Bayad is your partner?

139
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,112
>> Yeah, partner, boyfriend, so.

140
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:36,330
>> That's great.

141
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,480
So, what piece of equipment wouldn't you
leave without?

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,370
I mean that you have to take with you
every time?

143
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,820
>> Well, there's really a lot of things.

144
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,490
But definitely a down parka.

145
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,950
You know, something that I actually
probably, if all goes well,

146
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,730
I might not even wear.

147
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,250
But something that will help save my life
if something goes wrong.

148
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,690
>> And what have you noticed when your out
there about your physiology and

149
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,400
your performance as the temperature
fluctuates.

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,170
So, you know, your in a moderate
temperature of

151
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,090
20 below [LAUGH]
>> Yeah.

152
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,610
>> And it drops to 50 below, and what do
you notice there?

153
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,760
>> Well it's interesting because as it
gets colder, I really do slow down.

154
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,100
I mean, I'll feel like I'm work, you know,

155
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,420
if I actually had like a, some kind of a
odometer or

156
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,080
GPS, I would notice my speed decreasing,
even just walking or running along.

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,170
And, I think that's because it really gets
to

158
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,810
the point where your muscles aren't as
warm, and they can't warm up.

159
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,960
And that just slows you down.

160
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,190
I think of it as a little bit like a old
truck driving along and

161
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,550
the engine's sputtering, and you feel that
way.

162
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,240
That's one thing I've noticed.

163
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,070
Also, your body temperature becomes more
difficult to

164
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,570
regulate when it gets very cold.

165
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,620
I actually can, you know, put on too many
layers and start overheating and

166
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,640
start sweating, which is dangerous.

167
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,150
It's, that's the one thing you really try
to avoid, is sweating too profusely.

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,870
>> Mm-hm.

169
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,850
>> And when it's 20 above, it's pretty
easy to regulate temperature.

170
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,770
You just put on a few,

171
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,020
just enough layers to keep your skin from
being too exposed to the cold air.

172
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,140
And you output a lot of heat when you're
doing strenuous exercise.

173
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,520
>> And what's the tip point for
temperature that you can't have any

174
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,123
exposed skin or you'll get frostbite, do
you think?

175
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:28,520
>> I find about 30 below.

176
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,355
>> Sure.

177
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:31,130
[LAUGH]
>> Is still.

178
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,300
Yeah.
20 to 30 below.

179
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,990
I, I have been out at 20 below with my
full face exposed because I was running.

180
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,600
And then, you know, a ice mask would form
around my

181
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,438
the buff that I was wearing
>> Uh-huh.

182
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,740
>> Thirty below is when I really need to
put on the goggles or

183
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,300
my eyes are going to start,you know, I
feel that scratchiness.

184
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,450
Oh, my eyes are starting to freeze.

185
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,440
When it's windy it can be a lot warmer.

186
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
If you have a headwind and

187
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,920
even at zero, and it's blowing directly in
your face, really have to cover up.

188
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,480
>> And, you, there have gotta been times,

189
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,500
there has to have been times, when you
were out and you were scared.

190
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,700
That, you know, something was going wrong,
or

191
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,660
you just didn't want to be in that
situation.

192
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,760
So, describe some of those experiences.

193
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,000
>> Well I started the Iditarod in 2009.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,310
And about 25 miles into the race I was
crossing a lake.

195
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,320
And there was a part where this stream was
coming in and

196
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,700
there was a, a pressure crack that I
didn't see.

197
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,739
That was just covered in a very thin layer
of ice.

198
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,810
And at the time I was, had a bike but

199
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,600
I was walking because the snow was very
drifted and I couldn't ride.

200
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,200
And I actually stepped right into that,
that thin ice crack and

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,170
punched my leg all the way through, almost
up to my hip with one leg.

202
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,360
I managed to in the the frantic-ness of
it,

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
managed to scramble out before I put any
other body parts in which could have been,

204
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,965
I mean, I could have ended up in a lake.

205
00:10:56,965 --> 00:11:02,040
Because it was just, it was probably wide
enough to, to punch through, all the way

206
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,740
through, but I, I got part of my bike wet
as well but I managed to crawl out.

207
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,330
And I had a wet leg, And at the time it
was about zero maybe five below, but

208
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,480
there was a really strong wind cranking
over the lake.

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,750
And I knew I needed to, you know, I could
hear water sloshing around in the boot

210
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,150
that I was wearing, mountaineering boot is
what I use for biking.

211
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,440
And so I knew I needed to deal with it but

212
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,180
I didn't want to do it out on a lake where
it was so exposed to the wind.

213
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm like I'm going to get off the lake and
go to, to these trees.

214
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,170
But it took awhile to get to the trees,
and by the time I got there

215
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,500
a pretty thick layer of ice formed all the
way up my leg, and I had gaiters on.

216
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,980
And I would chip at it, and there was just
no way that boot was coming off.

217
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,710
I mean, I don't know how I would have
gotten it off so

218
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,010
I'm like, well next checkpoint is about 30
miles away, and

219
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,730
maybe if I ride 10 minutes and run 5
minutes,

220
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,970
I'll keep my foot warm enough to, to get
there without any problems.

221
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,110
But I, I was doing this and, and

222
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,670
I was actually feel, okay, I feel okay,
you know?

223
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,400
And I would, I made an effort to wiggle my
toes.

224
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,750
And I thought I was continuing to do that,
but in retrosp, you know,

225
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,440
in hindsight I probably was only imagining
myself wiggling my toes.

226
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,750
They probably weren't actually moving.

227
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,480
Because, as I kept going, the water inside
the boot froze solid.

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,630
It got colder and colder right around my
foot.

229
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,410
So it was just encased in a block of ice.

230
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,450
And the temperature dropped to,

231
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,050
other racers told me around Around 35 to
40 below that night.

232
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,926
So when I got to the next check point and

233
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:43,930
finally, and I sat by the fire for about
20 minutes before I could undo my gaiter.

234
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,220
I'm trying to pull my boot off and it's
not coming off.

235
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm like, what's wrong.

236
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,980
And I couldn't get the boot off.

237
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,830
It took, I mean, I had my foot up against
the wood stove.

238
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,680
It took another, probably 25-30 minutes of
thawing before I

239
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,430
was able to pull my bare foot out of the
sock that was frozen into the boot.

240
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,150
And it was, the whole foot was just chalk
white and I'm like, that's not good.

241
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,390
When I tried to move my toes, it was like
looking at them and nothing was happening.

242
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,550
So I decided, well I was going to try to
get some more miles in that night and

243
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,280
go to the next checkpoint but I, at the
time like that,

244
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,910
that could be a bad idea so I'm going to
wait it out, and went to sleep.

245
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,450
And then my foot started to thaw which was
probably the most painful experience I've

246
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,340
ever had was the thawing of the frozen
foot.

247
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,460
And as soon as it thawed, it blistered up
heavily.

248
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,720
The tips turned black.

249
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,530
And I actually even consulted the check
guy,

250
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,710
the official at the check point about it.

251
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,650
I'm like, what do you think?

252
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,360
How bad is this?

253
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,320
It was really painful.

254
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,100
I could barely walk.

255
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,962
>> I've seen worse.

256
00:13:55,962 --> 00:14:01,390
>> [LAUGH] And he's like, he's like, you
won't keep your toes if you go on.

257
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,590
He's like, he's like, he told me he hadn't
seen frostbite that bad in awhile.

258
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,360
>> Wow.

259
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
Okay.
>> On, on, you know, on a foot, so.

260
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,460
>> So that was it?

261
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,900
>> Yeah.
He said, he said,

262
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,975
you know, you can't continue in this race,
even if you,

263
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:20,560
you know, you're putting your life at
risk, maybe.

264
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,700
So, I scratched.

265
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,590
Went back and it was a long recovery
process.

266
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,330
Ori, initially,

267
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,640
they told me they were going to chop off
the tips of two of my toes.

268
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,080
But I had a really good doctor in Juno.

269
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,230
She was actually a burn specialist from
Fresno.

270
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,220
She had just barely moved to Alaska from
California herself.

271
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,030
But she was really good at recovering dead
skin, and

272
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,690
>> So you have all your toes.

273
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,440
>> I saved my toes.

274
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,336
>> Nice.
[LAUGH]

275
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,280
>> But with it you asked me if it

276
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,910
was really scary.

277
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,420
At the time it wasn't really frightening,
because I was just,

278
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,970
I thought I was dealing with the situation
as well as I could, and

279
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,464
in hindsight I made some poor decisions,
but.

280
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,270
>> And what would, what would you have
done differently?

281
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,660
>> What I really should have done is,

282
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,370
I should have stopped on the lake the
minute I got my foot wet.

283
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,690
Even with the snow, you know, and gotten
my sleeping bag out to put,

284
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,210
taken my boot off right away, gotten the
sleeping bag out, and then,

285
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,790
stuffed dry snow inside the boot to try to
draw out as much moisture, you know?

286
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,650
And then try to put a dry sack in there.

287
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,580
And use that system to get to the next
check point.

288
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,270
Keeping my foot as dry as possible.

289
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,465
>> What else have you learned with these
races that you,

290
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,390
you know, that you wouldn't do again?

291
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,630
Or that, you know, are sort of rookie
mistakes?

292
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,010
If you can share it with people.

293
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,730
>> Well other things that I've learned is

294
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,180
just how quickly wind can effect your body
temperature.

295
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,720
When Bayad and I did the Susitna 100 in
2011, you know?

296
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,700
That was after I had lived in Alaska for
years.

297
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,640
I had actually moved away from Alaska by
that point,

298
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,760
but I thought I was an old pro at that
point with the cold weather.

299
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,850
And since we were running early in the
race, we were really warm and

300
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,530
we were dressed pretty lightly for the
temperature, which was about 10 below.

301
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,530
But then it got dark and the wind started
cranking.

302
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,970
And we were still dressed in our, just our
single tights and our one, you know,

303
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,270
it had like two layers on top.

304
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,830
And we turned on this river directly into
the wind, and

305
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,460
it was just like this furnace blast of
cold air.

306
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,820
Like oh.
And, and I said,

307
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,710
I gotta get my down coat out.

308
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,370
I'm really actually suddenly really cold.

309
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,800
And I want to put my down coat on.

310
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,710
And so we stopped, and we were digging
around in our sleds.

311
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,660
And as we were doing this, like my fingers
went really rigid, and

312
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,760
it got to a point where I couldn't even,
like I was trying to work to the zipper.

313
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,060
And so now I'm really frantically, like
I'm pulling my down coat on,

314
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,700
and I'm trying to zip it up, and like I
just had these claws for hands.

315
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,590
And they weren't moving.

316
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm like oh.

317
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,420
And and I called out to Bayad, I'm like
can you help me zip up my

318
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,640
coat because I can't, you know?

319
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,505
And he was able to help me do that and
help me get my mittens back on.

320
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:08,110
We got our sleds out and started running
really quickly so as were running and

321
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,410
I have my down coat on, slowly it's
thawing out, you know.

322
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,010
But it is really scary to lose the use of
your hands and

323
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,639
if Bayad hadn't been there I would have
had a lot more problems.

324
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,340
Not being able to zip up my coat up, it
wouldn't give me any warmth,

325
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,074
because there, you know, the insulating
properties wouldn't work so.

326
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:26,200
>> Yeah.

327
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,920
It seems to me,

328
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,610
you've just given us several examples of
why you may not want to do this.

329
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,120
>> [LAUGH] Exactly.
>> Why, why, I mean,

330
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,940
you can go out into the beautiful
environments that you're talking about,

331
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,350
and not be doing a 350 mile Iditarod race
on your own.

332
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,610
So what, what drives you to keep that
challenge alive?

333
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,760
Other than the environment.

334
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,140
I mean why, why, why push yourself in
those environments on your own?

335
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,320
>> Well, it is, it's a very intense
experience.

336
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,180
I mean I love just the experience of being
alive, feeling everything,

337
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,327
all my senses sharpened.

338
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:04,140
And the endurance aspect of it really adds
to that intensity.

339
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,820
I mean, it's an intense experience just to
walk out of your house into 20 below and

340
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,500
stand out there, just for a few minutes.

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,580
That actually is, as well.

342
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,750
But there's just something deeper about
going out and just, basically, surviving.

343
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,060
I mean, that's, obviously, we'd survive a
lot better in California.

344
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,280
But, but getting that sense that I'm out
here, and

345
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,010
this is a really harsh environment but I'm
alive and

346
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,660
I'm, it just, it makes you feel very alive
and it's a very rewarding experience.

347
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,500
And there is hardly, there's no margin for
error.

348
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,169
And these are, the mistakes I made at the
time, I thought were very small mistakes.

349
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,810
They grew into bigger mistakes very
quickly.

350
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,500
And so you just have to be really focused
and

351
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,240
I kind of like that environment where you
have to do everything right.

352
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,400
I mean it really keeps me focused which is
a rewarding experience as well.

353
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,770
So, what kind of advice do you have for
people who want to do this?

354
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,970
>> Well, the two most important things for

355
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,510
doing a cold weather event are gear and
experience.

356
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,370
Because everybody responds differently to
cold,

357
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,180
as I'm sure you've seen in your studies.

358
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,530
And so, you've gotta figure out what works
for you.

359
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,890
You can't just go online and see oh, well,
this person bought all of these pieces of

360
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,800
gear, and I will buy exactly that and be
fine.

361
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,860
You actually need to test out different
kinds of materials, different, you know,

362
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,700
layers of gear.

363
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,528
And so, really testing gear is important
and also just gaining the experience in

364
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:35,300
the cold if you can to see how your body
reacts.

365
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,960
It will help you make better decisions
when you actually go out there.

366
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,190
I don't live, I mean I'm in the same
situation now where,

367
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,560
a lot of my experience is older and now I
live in California.

368
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,790
We're going to get a few training trips in
this season.

369
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:55,040
But I worry about that, I worry about
having lost that experience and,

370
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,700
you know, when it's 40 below again and

371
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,490
I need to make a very fast decision, so I
don't freeze my hands.

372
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,300
The, you know, making that decision before
my core temperature drops so

373
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,380
much that I freeze my hands.

374
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,960
>> So, do you have any last words of
wisdom that you'd like to share with our

375
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,670
viewing audience out there?

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,450
>> I, my only words of wisdom is I think
this is a very worthwhile

377
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,550
experience for people.

378
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,120
I, I highly recommend it.

379
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,260
Anyone who's interested in endurance
sports, or

380
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,480
cold weather sports, should just give it a
try.

381
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,970
It's a very small sport.

382
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,590
There aren't a lot of events out there.

383
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,270
But they're a worthwhile goal.

384
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,734
So.
>> Thank you so much for your time.

385
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:44,734
>> Thank

386
00:20:50,464 --> 00:21:00,464
you!

387
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:49,200
