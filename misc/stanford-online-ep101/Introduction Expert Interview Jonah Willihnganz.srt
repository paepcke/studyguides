1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,570
Because Stanford is so into acronyms I've
come up with an acronym for it, SLURP.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,400
So stories are the best vehicle for

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,650
learning, understanding, remembering and
persuading.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,830
>> Welcome to our expert interview for
this introductory section.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,550
One of the great things about working at
Stanford is you get to meet and

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,540
work with all sorts of interesting people,
like Jonah here.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,150
Jonah Willihnganz has taught literature,
creative writing and

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,080
media studies at Stanford since 2002.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,830
He has published fiction, essays and

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,880
literary criticism and holds a PhD in
English from Brown University and

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,525
an MFA in creative writing from Hollands
University.

12
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:44,990
He's also the director of the Stanford
Storytelling Project, and

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,400
it is in that latter capacity that we are
interviewing him today.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,350
He and I have worked together over the
past couple of

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,480
years to promote communication in science
through storytelling.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,360
You may be wondering why we are
interviewing an expert in storytelling for

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,020
an environmental physiology class.

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,330
Well, as you may recall from the
introductory video,

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,500
this class is woven together by story, the
story of where is Corey now?

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,870
Corey and I will experience a variety of
environmental stressors together that will

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,979
introduce the learning material for the
class.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,650
Hopefully as you get to know us you will
root for

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,230
us as we experience these challenges and
not against us.

24
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,300
Either way, though, we thought you might
like to hear why stories are so

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,570
important in our lives and

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,840
how they can impact our learning and our
communication, even in the sciences.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,730
So it is a pleasure to be here, today with
you, Jonah.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,380
Thank you for agreeing to talk with us
about story telling.

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,190
>> My pleasure.

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,960
And it's a lot of fun.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
>> Good.

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,610
So let's start with your work here at
Stanford.

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,030
So what is the Stanford story telling
project?

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:53,330
>> The story telling project is an art
program in the Vice Provost's office for

35
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,260
Undergraduate Education.

36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,670
And what we do is we create a radio show.

37
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,050
We make grants to undergraduates who are
studying oral traditions, or

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,380
who want to tell stories that are memoir
oriented, or documentary oriented.

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,010
>> Are you doing more than just relaying
this information?

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,660
Is it being integrated into teaching?

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,730
Why should we care about story telling in
teaching and learning?

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,890
This is the first basic question is why is
it that stories are so,

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,050
alluring to us and why are they the best
way to communicate with one another?

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,100
And the basic answer is that our brains
are conditioned for stories.

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,850
And some cognitive linguists and
evolutionary psychologists think that that

46
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,920
conditioning started, hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,900
Serves a very basic social function.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,109
psychologists, of different stripes think
that it.

49
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,890
Our propensity to learn, and remember, and
understand, and

50
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,580
communicate through stories has to do with
individual needs of

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,420
the psyche as well as social
communication.

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,430
But anyway you boil it down, the brain
seems to be wired for story.

53
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,040
It seems to want to learn.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,660
Through story, and part of this is because
we don't have just an intellect.

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,680
That intellect is married with emotional
responses.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,670
Until maybe 20 years ago people didn't
appreciate how deeply the intellect and

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,460
our emotional selves were linked.

58
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,890
And once we begin to understand that
particularly in, in psychology and

59
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,020
in linguistics, and to some extent in
neurobiology, we begin to learn that

60
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,830
if the intellect is always operating in a
charged way, it's always

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,530
operating with some emotional valence,
then the way that we receive information,

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,050
we process information and we deliver that
information matters a lot.

63
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,130
If it's very abstract and not attached to
anything, we're less likely to learn it,

64
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,940
we're less likely to remember it, we're
less likely to understand it, and

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,610
we're a lot less likely to be able to
communicate it back.

66
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,780
>> So do you have any last take home
message for our audience,

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,790
whether it be for students or executives
or anyone watching these videos at home.

68
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,840
>> Because Stanford is so into acronyms,
I've come up with an acronym for it.

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,050
SLURP.
So, stories are the best vehicle for

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,880
learning, understanding, remembering, and
persuading.

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,210
So, I think if people can just remember
that when you want to make a case

72
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:44,900
to somebody else about even something that
is maybe even particularly something

73
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,845
that is complicated, that the best way to
do this, is to deliver it thru a story.

74
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:57,180
So for example, in the altitude segment,
you have Cory up on the mountain arriving.

75
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,960
And then beginning to experience the
pressure of, or, the stress on the body,

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,180
of adapting to the higher altitude and the
the low oxygen,

77
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,010
and, you're going to actually see the
things that happen to the body.

78
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,450
And as you see that, you're going to have
a a visceral,

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,460
identification with the experience of a
character, who's going through something,

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,300
so that when the information that explains
the causes of that.

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,610
Things that may mitigate that appears, as
that information comes in,

82
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,440
it's going to stick to something that's
very concrete.

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,610
The last thing that I'll say is, you know,
the research in particularly in

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,130
cognitive psychology and neurobiology
about how mirror neurons work, have shown

85
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,180
us that the brain really doesn't make very
much of a meaningful distinction between

86
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,180
stuff that we experience ourselves and
things that we watched experience.

87
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,363
So what that means is when we're watching
Corey, we generally are able to imagine,

88
00:05:55,363 --> 00:06:00,846
interpolate ourselves into his position,
and have those experiences to some extent.

89
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:04,864
So when critical information then gets
attached to that,

90
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,242
that stays in our brain it stays and

91
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:12,380
we understand it better than had it just
been presented in the abstract.

92
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,944
From your lips to our students brains,
let's hope that works,

93
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:20,576
that's what we're going for, thank you so
much, that's a perfect place to end.

94
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:21,616
>> Great, it's a pleasure.
