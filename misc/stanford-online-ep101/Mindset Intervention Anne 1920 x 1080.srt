00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:04,280
To go through this class, one thing to
remember is that sometimes,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,970
students might feel unmotivated or
discouraged during an online course.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,230
Sometimes, this is because they believe
their ability is more or

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,250
less fixed, and can't be changed much.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,040
At other times, people recognize that
abilities and

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,229
skills can be changed with effort, and by
figuring out what learning strategies work

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,720
It seems simple, but when you encounter
challenges in this online course,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,490
it could help to notice if you are
responding with the attitude that your

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,700
ability is fixed, or the attitude that
your skills can change.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,720
For example, you could remind yourself
that believing ability is fixed can

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,520
hold you back, while believing that
abilities are malleable can motivate you

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,800
to put in effort to focus on how you can
effectively learn and solve problems.

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,570
One way you can practice this is by
attempting to answer questions even when

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,720
you don't know the right answers, and
might get them wrong.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,540
If you think your ability is fixed, it's
embarrassing to be unsuccessful.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,060
But if you believe your ability is
changeable, then even when you think you

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,490
can't provide right answers, put in the
effort to brainstorm answers as

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,500
just part of the reflection process and
can prepare you to learn more later.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,670
Taking a course online may be a novel
experience for

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,740
you We believe that if you put in the
effort you will get what you want out of

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,360
this course and we're excited to see the
growth that you experience along the way.
