[MAN SHIVERING INTENSELY]
>> Vic, let's get you out of there.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,270
>> Welcome to our expert interview on
cold.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,300
Today we're here with Dr. Thomas Nuckton,
who is a specialist in pulmonary and

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,510
critical care medicine with Sutter Health,
and

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,760
an Associate Clinical Professor of
Medicine in the UCSF Medical School.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,820
He primarily focuses on studying survival
prognoses for

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,280
patients in intensive care wards, which is
led to the exploration of a wide range of

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,810
interests from sleep to hypothermia.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,660
His research aims to better inform
physicians caring for

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,060
critically ill patients in intensive care
units.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,620
Dr. Nuckton was involved in designing and
implementing the Alcatraz swim study.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,738
Where Dr. Nuckton and his colleagues
explored questions related to hypothermia,

13
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:45,810
an after drop in the ann, in the annual
San Francisco Bay Race.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,720
As a member of the Dolphin Club and the
Polar Bear Club himself, Dr. Nuckton

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,590
bridges the experiential and research
perspective on what it means to be cold.

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,980
For those reasons and many others, it's a
pleasure to be here with you today.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,630
Thank you so much for agreeing to talk
with us.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,130
>> Thank you.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,620
>> So, you are normally in pulmonary and
critically care med,

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,116
critical care medicine, so how did you
come to cold research and

21
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:12,380
being a cold swim yourself, which came
first?

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,210
>> Well I grew up swimming and playing
water polo and

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,200
the water always seemed to be cold but I
did my fellowship in pulmonary and

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,410
critical care medicine at UC San
Francisco, and I got involved in

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,070
critical care outcomes research where we
examined physiologic variables to

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,570
see if we can predict how intensive care
unit patients are going to do over time.

27
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,680
And, the methods that we use for that the
regression models and

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,200
the statistics lend themselves very well
to hypothermia research.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,470
And it just so happens that the San
Francisco Bay is and

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,960
was home to a really large group of cold
water swimmers folks that

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,355
swim year round without wetsuits in the
bay.

32
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:03,060
And you can go down there on any given
day, it's at aquatic park near

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,935
Fisherman's Wharf it's really nice setting
right below Ghirardelli Square and,

34
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,225
near the high street pier historic ships
and you can see folks swimming back and

35
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,780
forth without wetsuits.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,036
So we approached those swimmers and asked,
hey would you be willing to participate in

37
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:24,770
physiology research where we are examining
emergent hypothermia, and they said yes.

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,420
They were incredibly supportive and
enthusiastic about helping us.

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,400
>> Great.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,660
And was that before or after you started
swimming with them?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,830
I would occasionally go down there to swim
with folks I knew.

42
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,220
I knew people in the club and I think I
became a club member in 2005 or 2006.

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,850
So the study, you can, you can swim just
as a guest there or day use.

44
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,900
But I didn't join the club until about
five or

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,400
six years after we had published our first
study.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
>> And how cold is the water in the bay?

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,511
>> The bay right now is about 60 degrees
but

48
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:02,220
in the winter it will go down to about 48
degrees, or 50 somewhere in that range.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,730
Well this last winter it was a very cold
winter, we had several days below 50.

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,400
>> And how long can a normal person
survive in that temperature water?

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,100
>> It depends on the size of the
individual but it depends on whether or

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,750
not they're wearing a life jacket.

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,010
If they're not a good swimmer and

54
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,310
you fall in a 48 degree water, you're
survival time is estimated in minutes.

55
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,530
But if you have a life jacket on and
you're protected at

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,290
least from that initial cold shock
response you need two or

57
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,570
three hours of total survival if, if
you're a good sized individual.

58
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,730
>> And what does the life jacket have to
do with the survival?

59
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,520
>> If you get in really cold water at the
beginning,

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,000
you really don't even have time to get
hypothermic.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,570
You'll have this cold shock response,
where you'll,

62
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,038
you'll increase your ventilatory rate,
hyperventilate, become tachycardic,

63
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:55,790
your blood pressure will go up, you'll
have muscle weakness and extremity pain.

64
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,010
And most folks while they're in this cold
shock will drown.

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,825
Most people don't die of hypothermia, they
don't have time to get hypothermic, so

66
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:09,340
they'll die with this cold shock response
and so that's the life jacket.

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,090
If you're wearing a life jacket that cold
shock is uncomfortable, but

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,160
most people survive it.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,830
>> Interesting.

70
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,710
So you've done a number of studies now
with the club.

71
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,370
>> Yeah.
>> And,

72
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,460
what were some of your major findings and
discoveries?

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,670
>> I think they kind of get put into two
different categories.

74
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,370
One are, are studies that have
applications to true core hypothermia,

75
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,990
cooling and survival, and others that are
more geared toward sports medicine,

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,140
and, and, and the health implications of
swimming in cold water.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,490
For true core hypothermia and

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,000
survival we go back to our first study,
which was published in 2000.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,746
And in that study, we studied the New
Year's Day Alcatraz swimmers.

80
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:57,660
They swim from new, from Alcatraz to shore
distance of about a mile and

81
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,100
a half on New Year's day, one of the
coldest days of the year without wetsuits.

82
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:08,810
And we had just one simple question.

83
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,010
Do these swimmers become medically
hypothermic?

84
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,880
They have all sorts of ways of describing,
oh it was cold, it was freezing, it was.

85
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,790
All of these things, but

86
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,100
we want to know do they, do they mean a
medical definition of hypothermia?

87
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,260
And to determine that we asked these

88
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,670
swimmers to have rectal temperature
measurements.

89
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,380
We measured their core temperature after
they got out of the water, and we found

90
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,880
that five out of 11 subjects did reach a
medical definition of mild hypothermia.

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,730
These swimmers also had a phenomena,
underwent something called after drop, and

92
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,340
after drop refers to continued core
cooling after removal from cold a stress,

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,650
so after you get out of the water.

94
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,980
And just about every one of the swimmers
had this, and that, that's to be expected.

95
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,140
What we didn't expect was it, it was very
dramatic in certain individuals,

96
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,040
the drop in temperature was precipitous
in, in some of the subjects.

97
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:10,812
So applying that research in terms of
other swimming events

98
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:16,660
folks are at risk for hypothermia if they
participate without wetsuits.

99
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,970
And then you can anticipate this
afterdrop.

100
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,246
So keeping an eye on folks after the
event, we think is a good idea.

101
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:28,364
In terms of, of, of rescuing immersion
victims it's,

102
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:32,530
it's a reminder, that look as the rescuer
once you get your victim out of the water

103
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,790
your job is not done, they're still having
a core temperature decrease and

104
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,300
that's something you need to pay attention
to.

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,810
>> Yeah that can be really scary,

106
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,780
your drop's not done once they're out of
the water, clearly.

107
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,480
>> Right, that's right.

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,240
>> And we did see that in Cory's video
where we put him in a,

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
in a cold water tank and took then took
him out and had him walk on

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,690
the treadmill and he got colder while he
was walking on the treadmill.

111
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,680
It seems a little bit different in that
case than what your swimmers experience,

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,920
because your swimmers were swimming then
they came out and rested.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,050
He was sitting in cold water and then came
out and exercise.

114
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,982
>> And exercise, yeah.
>> Are the mechanisms different there?

115
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:08,500
>> They're similar, but exercise in some
studies has been shown to

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,080
worsen afterdrop, basically get that core
blood,

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,960
that's warm pumping down into the
extremities which are very cold, and

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,430
then that cold blood comes back to the
core so exercise can worsen that.

119
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,770
And that's why in some treatment protocols
when folks are rescued when victims

120
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,210
are rescued, they're advised to lie still,
and not exercise it depends on how severe

121
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,870
the hypothermia is but, but in some cases
exercise can worsen that after drop.

122
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,220
>> Yeah, it's something to definitely keep
in mind.

123
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,000
>> Yeah.
>> So

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,170
these swimmers that you're studying are in
and out of the water a lot.

125
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,220
So they do this recreationally.

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,750
>> Sure.
>> Are they experiencing hypothermia every

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,330
time they go for a recreational swim and

128
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,370
is that bad for someone over time to be
hypothermic, normal, hypothermic, normal?

129
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,970
Certainly we haven't seen any, you know,
adverse events in, in,

130
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,150
in the long term, but there aren't a lot
of longitudinal studies, so I don't know.

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,875
And they probably do get mildly
hypothermic, they probably feel it less,

132
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,552
because they're acclimatized.

133
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:15,120
We also have warm showers and saunas that
are readily available.

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,716
So alotta that, you know you come out of
the water and

135
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:21,846
they go straight into a nice warm shower,
and some folks make the shower lukewarm to

136
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:24,890
begin and kind of, and then go into the
sauna afterwards.

137
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,754
So, my hunch is that most folks are not
getting hypothermic on

138
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:33,950
a daily basis because of the showers and,
and the saunas that are there.

139
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,950
>> And I asked on the detrimental side but
I've heard many cold water swimmers

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,910
claim that it's actually beneficial for
them to be cold periodically.

141
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,834
Do you agree with that?

142
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,180
>> Yeah.
>> Is that a possibility?

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,160
>> I don't know, and I'm a little bit
skeptical on, on, on certain aspects.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,020
There are studies, preliminary studies
that have

145
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,230
suggested that frequent immersion in cold
water improves the immune system,

146
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,140
increases your, your T-cell count
increases beneficial cytokines increases

147
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,840
antioxidants it helps improve mood and,
and

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,880
can be used as a treatment for depression
and fibromyalgia and asthma and.

149
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,135
There's all sorts of preliminary studies
out there but

150
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:19,120
they're not any really good longitudinal
studies, so we really don't know.

151
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
And, and I think they're interesting
there's some

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,870
interesting hypotheses out there, but I
think a lot more work needs to be done.

153
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,930
>> And I've heard you mention brown
adipose tissue before and

154
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,360
we talked about it in our learning
modules.

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,930
>> Right.
>> And

156
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,270
some people claim that any beneficial
effect may be partially related to

157
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,370
the brown adipose tissue.

158
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,880
Can you talk about that and where the
research is going?

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,830
>> Sure, sure.

160
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,290
So what is brown fat?

161
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,612
Brown fat is, is fat that has increased
mitochondria count.

162
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,620
So there's a higher density of
mitochondria and

163
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,240
it actually produces energy.

164
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,010
And it's found primarily in hibernating
animals and in babies.

165
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,210
But it is also seen in adults especially
after cold exposure.

166
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,740
It gets activated after cold exposure.

167
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,250
So there's a theory that these swimmers
that swim routinely in cold water,

168
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,660
either increase their total amount of
brown fat or

169
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,510
the brown fat they have is charged and is
activated.

170
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,580
Because this fat is metabolic,

171
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,630
it's often referred to as the good fat as
opposed to the bad white fat.

172
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,010
In all, and there's been some speculation
that having more brown fat is good for

173
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,122
you, it improves your metabolism and

174
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:38,970
it can have all sorts of health benefits,
I honestly don't know.

175
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,870
It's a interesting theory, I'm a little
bit skeptical because the swimmers

176
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,950
even though they are acclimatized, they
cool at more or

177
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,730
less the same rate I was expect anyone to
cool.

178
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,770
So if their brown fat were really hi, I'm
a, and, and

179
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,240
it was working I would expect them to cool
a bit slower or substantially slower rate.

180
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,240
But I don't know.

181
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,090
I haven't measured brown fat in any of the
swimmers and you know,

182
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,140
I think it's interesting theory but just
more research needs to be done.

183
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,620
>> Yeah I think that's a, a safe way to
end that.

184
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,890
I mean, it's, it's sort of gone beyond
cold water swimming now, and

185
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,150
people are trying to take cold showers,
and roll in the snow.

186
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,250
>> Right, right.
>> To increase their fat,

187
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,220
with the hope of losing weight.

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,670
>> Pharmaceutically hoping to improve
their brown fat.

189
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,400
>> Right. Right. Indeed.
>> But

190
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,830
I think the jury's still out on that.

191
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,790
>> Yeah.
>> A lot of work needs to be done.

192
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,150
>> It's going to be a major target, and

193
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,300
a lot of money's going to go into that in
the next five years or so.

194
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,030
>> We'll have to see, yeah.

195
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,040
>> So we talked a little bit about
survival briefly when

196
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,160
we touched on the life preservers, and
because of your experience you've

197
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,500
taught survival skills in cold water, so
what else can you share with people about

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,110
what to do if you're in a situation where
you're exposed to cold water?

199
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,500
>> Well there's two or three things that,
that come to mind, and the first one is.

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,480
To get out of the water, and

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,270
I'm not being cute there you lose heat to
water some 25 times compared to air.

202
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,160
And I think most of us know that
intuitively if you go jogging in 53 degree

203
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,750
air wearing shorts and a t-shirt, most
people are reasonably comfortable.

204
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,560
If you go swimming in 53 degree water,
you'll feel it.

205
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,700
That cold water can just suck the heat
right out of you.

206
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,150
So if you find yourself in a situation
where you're ending up in cold water,

207
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,750
if there's anything you can do to get out,
pull yourself up on a raft or

208
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,250
on, onto some debris that kind of kind of
thing.

209
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,920
There have been survival accounts of
people that have survived in

210
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,810
really cold water by getting up on some of
the wreckage and

211
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,190
getting themselves outta the water.

212
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,320
The next thing would be the life jackets
again you know,

213
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,330
it's gets hammered home by the coastguard
all the time and that's for good reason.

214
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,760
If you are in a life jacket, your survival
time is just exponentially increased if,

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,870
if you, if you don't have that life
jacket,

216
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,420
there's a good chance you won't even have
a chance, have time to become hypothermic,

217
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,160
you'll, you'll drown in this cold, with
this cold shock phenomena contributing.

218
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,350
So wear that life jacket, it's going to
increase your survival time and then.

219
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,840
Also survival suits since legislation has
been passed in Alaska for

220
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,560
example, the fishing vessels are now
required to have

221
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,720
survival suits the fatality rate amongst
fishermen is decreased.

222
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,742
So survival suits and life jackets and

223
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:18,120
getting out of the water are the things
that I really recommend.

224
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,750
>> What is a survival suit?

225
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,480
>> Survival suit is a, there's a
different,

226
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,119
different types out there but, the common
one it's a,

227
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:28,710
it's a neoprene suit that, that folks get
into before they get into cold water.

228
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,060
It's often called the gumby suit because
you look like gumby in it.

229
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,120
And it basically allows a lot of you to
stay dry in the parts that aren't dry

230
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,910
to be insulated so it increases, it
decreases your core cooling dramatically.

231
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,510
So wearing that suit is going to increase
your odds of survival.

232
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,940
>> And you're supposed to wear it around
the boat in case it capsizes or

233
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,180
just if like boat is going down?

234
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,143
>> If the boat is going down.

235
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:53,760
>> And that, that's problematic too you
know, they, they're trying to

236
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,160
increase training so people can get into
these suits so rapidly, and, and

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,220
inspect the suits to make sure there's no
leaks in them, and that kind of thing.

238
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,364
>> Yeah I've tried to get into a wetsuit
when I've been a little damp.

239
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:05,680
>> Right.
>> And it's very challenging,

240
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,030
to get the neoprene on.

241
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,946
>> It is.

242
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:08,760
>> Good.

243
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,180
So that's that's survival.

244
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,655
What about performance in cold water?

245
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:17,400
>> Yeah performance is always a tough
issue, It's a tough issue in any sport,

246
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,770
tough issue in running, how much you know
is, the VO2 max versus training regimen,

247
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,930
diet, all of those things kind of you
know,

248
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,910
it's a pretty complex interplay of
factors.

249
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,070
And in cold water swimming, it's the same.

250
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,730
The things most people talk to me about,

251
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,100
you know what can I do to get used to this
cold shock?

252
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,260
And if you get in the water every single
day,

253
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,640
these cold shock reflexes get blunted.

254
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,530
So if you have never been in cold water
before, and

255
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,630
you just go down to the bay and hop in on
a daywards 48 degrees, you will

256
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,840
hyperventilate, you'll become tachycardic,
you'll have extremity weakness and

257
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,830
pain, you might feel nauseous but if you
get in every single day,

258
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,960
you get in every single day for a week
you'll do much better by the end of it.

259
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,910
So, climatizing is, is something that can
be very helpful.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,950
The problem with that though is even
though you feel better,

261
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,020
your core temperature is probably still
going down.

262
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,200
So you feel fine, you're out there
swimming, or you feel better,

263
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,270
you're out there swimming, but you can
still run into trouble.

264
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,370
And that has happened to some of the
swimmers down there.

265
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,740
They'll say, I was swimming along, I felt
fine but

266
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,120
then, things weren't quite working out
well and they were becoming hypothermic.

267
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,590
>> So there's not, a threshold below which
they start to feel this same?

268
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,910
They, that, that benefit continues down
even into the hypothermic range,

269
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,210
acclimatization benefit?

270
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,720
>> Right, right, so most of the cold shock
response is in the first five to ten

271
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,344
minutes, so you get through that and then
you start swimming and you feel okay and

272
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:54,920
most people wouldn't even be in the water,
because they would've of you know,

273
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,310
they would've had that cold shock and just
said no I'm not going any further.

274
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,506
These swimmers get through that, and then
they keep swimming but they're still

275
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:06,310
swimming in cold water and their
temperature, they're still losing heat.

276
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,360
>> So what's the first sign, for

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,020
them to recognize that they're starting to
get into the danger zone?

278
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,150
>> It can be different for, for, for
different people.

279
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,440
I have one of the swimmers down there
practices his times tables.

280
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,131
>> [LAUGH]

281
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,540
>> And when he can't do them, then he
thinks he needs to go out.

282
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,230
And, and other people have different
tricks that they try, but

283
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,970
I've never seen anything that you can
really hang your hat on.

284
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,880
I think, you know, it's a judgement call
and

285
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
before you go swimming, look at the water
temperature and

286
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,370
say, you know what, I'm only going to swim
for 15 minutes today,

287
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,180
the water is really cold, I'm not going to
push it for a couple of hours.

288
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,130
>> I noticed with the dolphin club they
frequently have a boat nearby, do you swim

289
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,710
with groups and with people monitoring so,
in case someone get's hypothermic?

290
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,390
>> So the rules at the, at the Dolphin
Club are that you

291
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,340
can swim inside the cove on your own as
much as you like.

292
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,640
But you can't go outside the cove unless
you have a pilot.

293
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,830
And we have several sanctioned events
every, every year.

294
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,725
The Alcatraz swim, The Golden Gate swim,
Pier 39 swim.

295
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:10,100
In, excuse me, in those swims they, they
have a whole group of pilots

296
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,360
that are out there in rowboats, it's a
rowing club as well I should add, so.

297
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,500
They have these, this great fleet of
historic wooden row boats.

298
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,590
That, that folks are out there as well as
kayakers to make sure that the events are,

299
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,880
are as safe as possible.

300
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,280
So, outside the cove, you have to have a
pilot.

301
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,220
>> Makes sense.
>> Yeah.

302
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,454
>> So, what about these extreme characters
that you see written up

303
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:38,092
swimming the English Channel, swimming in
Antarctica, you the iceman.

304
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:43,050
Is there something different about their
physiology that makes them capable of

305
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,920
doing this?

306
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,274
>> I think.

307
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,910
Yes and no.

308
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,160
In terms of the English Channel that's,
that's a great example.

309
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,880
If you look at some of the older survival
tables, the average survival time for

310
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,590
an aviator, or a mariner, would be about
six hours in the English Channel.

311
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,520
But people that swim the English Channel
they take twice that long, some of them.

312
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,180
You know, I know somebody that just spent
12 hours in the Channel.

313
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,680
And an, an elite swimmer can generate
heat.

314
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,640
So if you can generate heat consistently,
and

315
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,240
some elite swimmers can swim at 80% of
their maximum workload.

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,156
So you can overcome you know, these
survival tables.

317
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:31,180
But that can be really hard to do when the
water's 50 degrees.

318
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,910
The channel's usually 60, give or take,
when most folks do their attempt.

319
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,840
If the channel were 48 degrees, I think it
would be a different story.

320
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,280
In people that swim in really cold water,

321
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,010
I think there's some common
characteristics.

322
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,920
One, they're in usually in phenomenal
shape.

323
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,700
So they're in really good physical shape.

324
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,250
two, they limit the amount of time they go
in.

325
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,470
They study very carefully, you know, how
long you're going to be in the water.

326
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,720
Some of these polar swims only last about
20 minutes.

327
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,790
And then, many of them gain weight, before
they get in the water.

328
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,090
So they have an increased layer of fat, or

329
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,740
size, because it's not just fat, it's
overall, overall size, overall volume.

330
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,490
Smaller surface to volume ratio things of
that nature.

331
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,240
So they're good at generating heat, they
also have increased fat layer, and

332
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,220
they're careful about monitoring how long
they're going to be in the water.

333
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,960
>> And, they can tolerate pain.

334
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,370
>> And, they are acclimatized [LAUGH] I
won't take that away from them.

335
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,416
They are acclimatized and, and

336
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,410
in that sense they are different than
someone walking down the street.

337
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,610
They've been, They've been in cold water
repeatedly preparing for the event.

338
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,956
>> How do you do it?

339
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,208
How do you get over the pain?

340
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:48,030
>> I just, you just go down there and hop
in and sort of how I do it.

341
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,820
I have to coax myself into the water.

342
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,270
Some of the swimmers, it's a spiritual
experience.

343
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,402
And, you know, I kind of grew up with it.

344
00:19:54,402 --> 00:20:00,260
It's a little bit of a chore for me, I
have my good days, I like it.

345
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,150
But for me it's a workout and I don't
really enjoy working out personally.

346
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,900
But you know if, if you skip a week you're
going to feel it.

347
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,720
You're not going to be as acclimatized, so

348
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,010
that's also the incentive to keep it up
once you start swimming.

349
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,080
Keep going back in or you're going to have
a problem after taking time off, so.

350
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
>> So it's type two fun as they say.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,440
It's more fun when you get out not when
you're actually doing it.

352
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,860
>> For me, definitely, but

353
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,020
I think everybody has their own reasons
for doing it.

354
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,100
>> Good.

355
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,170
So getting back to the research on cold.

356
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,770
So what, what's next for you and

357
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,630
what do you see, where do you see the
field going now?

358
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,900
>> I think you know we talked about brown
fat, that's obviously a hot topic.

359
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,430
Other things with these cytokines and,
sort of,

360
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,030
what are the health implications of
swimming in cold water?

361
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,080
And I think longitudinal studies.

362
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,960
We have a database ongoing where we've,
you know, gathering data continually in

363
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,610
these swimmers longet, lon, longevity, and
does this help?

364
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,810
We have some, some octogenarians that swim
three times a week down at the club.

365
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,370
All of those things I think need to be
studied over time,

366
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,200
and so that's where I sort of see some of
the future with this.

367
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,410
There's also some mathematical modeling
work that can still be done.

368
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,230
How much this whole interplay between how
much heat can you

369
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,630
generate versus that heat being sucked out
of you.

370
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,280
At what temperatures is it feasible.

371
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,240
At what temperatures isn't it, it, isn't
it feasible.

372
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,370
Things of that nature.

373
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,470
And then in terms of survival it doesn't
sound as glamourous.

374
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,970
And it just sounds like a broken record
but the lifejackets, how do you

375
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,120
increase use of lifejackets and folks and,
you know, if it's just in the boat and

376
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,090
you fall in the water and you can't get to
it, it doesn't do much good.

377
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,820
How do you get people to actually wear
their life jackets and,

378
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,150
and get into their survival suits quickly
when the,

379
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,440
when their, when their vessel is sinking,
those kinds of things.

380
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,790
>> Great.

381
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,255
And we have a lot of students out there
who're watching this probably, and

382
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,600
many of them may be interested in code
research.

383
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,970
Do you have any suggestions for them or
tips for

384
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,550
them on how to get involved in the field?

385
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,160
>> You know, I think.

386
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:15,120
Pretty much, the, the resear,

387
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,550
the advice I would give to a researcher in
general would be

388
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,960
probably something they've heard, things
that they've heard many times, you know.

389
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,300
Do you homework first.

390
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,540
Really learn basic physiology first.

391
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,350
and, and really study the physiology
around what your,

392
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,860
what your going to be doing research in.

393
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,930
Also learn as much statistics as you can,

394
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,420
so that you can take a really rigorous
statistical approach.

395
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,290
When you're, when you're doing a research
project.

396
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,650
All of those things.

397
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,535
On a personal level I would have two
things that I would recommend.

398
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:54,560
One, first and foremost, don't discount
the older studies.

399
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,790
There are some fantastic studies from the
1960s, 70s, and 80s.

400
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,910
And you'll go and look up that study from
1965 on cold shock, and, and

401
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,780
really read it carefully.

402
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,050
And a lot of times, you'll find that some
of the questions that you're having have

403
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,440
already been answered.

404
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,840
If you just take the time to go back, and
look at some of these older studies.

405
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,850
So, don't discount them.

406
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,120
By the same token, some of these
investigators are still around.

407
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,090
Give em a call, talk to some of the senior
guys.

408
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,186
Their just remarkable resource.

409
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:31,410
you, my on, I on, example that comes to
mind I.

410
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,460
A few months back, I met with Dr. Martin
Nemeroff.

411
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,115
Who's a retired coast guard physician who
did a lot of pioneer work in

412
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:42,980
resuscitating children who had been under
the ice, for say half an hour.

413
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,100
And just meeting him, with him was just
fascinating.

414
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,390
You know, hearing his story, hearing his
approach.

415
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,910
I mean I probably learned more from him,

416
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,350
it would've taken me hours to go to try
and different journals and, and

417
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,580
text to try and you know, tease some of
those things out.

418
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,640
So you know, talk to the older folks.

419
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,800
And then I think also moving forward in
terms of a research career

420
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,930
with funding cuts being what they are,

421
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,670
you're going to have to be I think both
flexible and resourceful.

422
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,470
Not only in your career but also in the
research itself.

423
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,860
So you know, any academic position is a
combination between teaching,

424
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,500
administration and research and

425
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,410
in some years it's going to be more of one
and other years more of the other, and

426
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,910
I think you know, new graduates should be
aware of that.

427
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,360
And then also same with the studies.

428
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,340
Can you do a study with less funding?

429
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,120
Quite frankly.

430
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,890
Can you do a non-funded study?

431
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,320
Can you, you know can you, can you work
through various aspects of the study using

432
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,510
mathematical modeling instead, and is that
going to work or is it not going to work?

433
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,550
So those kind of things.

434
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,260
So talking to the older folks, and looking
at the older studies, and then,

435
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,140
also Being flexible and resourceful as you
move forward with your career.

436
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,270
>> That's great advice.

437
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,150
So it's interesting about the older
studies in this field in

438
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,030
particular is it because the technology
that we use to measure cold has

439
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,290
not changed that much over the years.

440
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,024
because in a lot of the newer fields you
know,

441
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,610
if it's older than ten years, people
discount it.

442
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,200
So what, what allows you to go back into
the 60s and get that great data?

443
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,920
some, some of that's true I think, you
know, temperature measurement is

444
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,550
temperature measurement thermometers are
not dramatically different.

445
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,640
But I think you know, for a while,
physiology was sort of king, and

446
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
there was a lot of work being done in
physiology and

447
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,200
now things are a little bit more
molecular.

448
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,910
And I think with some of the younger
students I've

449
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,960
met there's just a tendency to discount
some of those older studies.

450
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,060
Not that there aren't good studies being
done now but

451
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,960
you just want to make sure you're not
trying to reinvent the wheel,

452
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,840
when it's already been examined very
carefully by some very bright individuals.

453
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,230
>> I think that's a great place to end it,
thank you so much.

454
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,798
>> Sure.

455
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,827
>> Really, really interesting information.

456
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,216
>> Great, thank you.

457
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:07,159
[MAN SHIVERING INTENSELY]
>> Vic,

458
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:15,331
let's get you

459
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:23,504
out of there.
