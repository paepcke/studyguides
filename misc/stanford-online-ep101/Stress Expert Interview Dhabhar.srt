1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,170
I think what's really cool about your
approach to

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,150
stress is it sort of brings a different
light that maybe we

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,680
don't hear about often in the common media
which is that some of

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,955
your work has looked at some of the
positive things that stress can do for us.

5
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:18,800
Dr. Firdaus Dhabhar is an Associate
Professor of Psychiatry and a member,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,480
member of The Cancer Institute, Emnuology
Institute, and

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,550
neuroscience program at Stanford
University.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,670
He was the first to discover mechanisms by
which short term stress physiology

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,980
enhances the body's immune defences during
a fight or flight response.

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,740
His research explores the basic mechanisms
of good stress.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,900
As well as the potential to harness the
fight or

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,610
flight stress response in a clinical
setting to improve immune responses during

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,960
surgery, vaccination, and cancer.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,200
He also investigates mechanisms underlying
chronic or

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,180
bad stress that is known to have numerous
deleterious effects on the brain and body.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,040
Professor Dhabhar's research for

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,980
developing a more nuanced relationship
with stress.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,250
Turning up good stress, and turning down
bad stress.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,870
He is a highly decorated researcher and
educator with numerous highly cited

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,790
scientific publications, as well as
recognition in the press and media.

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,870
Yeah.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,330
For those reasons and many others.

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,220
It's a great pleasure and an honour to
turn to our expert interview in stress

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,880
physiology with Professor Ferdose Dhabhar.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,330
Thank you so much for being here today,
I'm really excited about having you.

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,080
>> Thank you it's a pleasure to be here.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,140
>> Awesome.

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,090
Well, I think a great place to start would
be at the beginning.

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,340
And I was wondering if you could tell us a
little bit about the story of,

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,040
how you made a career out of stress.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,340
What was so

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,190
interesting to you about stress physiology
that it's taken you to where you are now?

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,090
>> Okay.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,270
so, you know, I think it was really a
combination of circumstances and

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,800
having good mentors along the way.

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,390
Circumstances in the sense that I grew up
an India, where just the sort

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,714
of way of life is a very naturally sort of
holistic way of looking at things.

38
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:13,330
My dad, you know, used to talk to us about
how

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,520
aspects of the brain and mind could be
quite important in you know,

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,100
affecting performance and affecting, you
know, health.

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,910
And so I grew up with that appreciation.

42
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,940
>> It sounds like it started really early.

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,960
You got exposure to a lot of different
things and some great mentors.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,410
Especially where you are now.

45
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,760
>> And I think the mentors, yes, is, is,
is, I really you know gratefully believe.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,570
You know, we're key to sort of enabling
you and supporting you, you know,

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,400
to do something like this.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,420
>> Mm-hm.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,790
Great mentors are key, Dr. Freelander is a
good mentor for me, so.

50
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,450
>> That's terrific.

51
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,930
>> I can relate.
>> So you know what I'm talking about.

52
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,460
>> I can relate.

53
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,520
>> Yeah.

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,190
>> So that, that leads me into starting to
talk a little bit

55
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,680
more about the work you're doing now.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,290
If you could speak a little bit to why you
think stress has such a bad reputation.

57
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,180
And, and in light of that, what's your
sort of general stance on, on stress?

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,200
>> Sure.

59
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,570
So, you know, stress does have a bad
reputation.

60
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,870
And in many ways it's well deserved.

61
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,230
So, you know, a lot of research has shown
that,

62
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,480
chronic stressors are general stressors
that go on for weeks to months to years.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,340
Can have numerous deleterious effects on
both brain and body.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,940
They can contribute to disease, exacerbate
disease, and so

65
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,460
that's one of the primary reasons why
stress has a bad reputation.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,240
The other reason is that people in their
own lives can, you know,

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,010
relate to experiences when they have been
under a lot of stress.

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,390
And you know, not very nice things have
happened or bad things have happened.

69
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,910
So it's a well-deserved, you know, bad
reputation.

70
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,450
But there are several things that we
sometimes forget about, you know,

71
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,340
when thinking about stress.

72
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,830
And, if you remember those things it sort
of,

73
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,910
gets you to appreciate that stress is not
all bad.

74
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,200
And that it need not necessarily always be
this big, bad pathological entity.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,245
>> Mm-hm.

76
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,580
>> So what are those things?

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,870
One is that mother nature gave us the
stress response.

78
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,000
The fight or flight response.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,870
To help us survive.

80
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,560
Not to kill us.

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,660
So nature's purpose to the stress response
is to enable survival.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,770
The other is, and this is related to the
first-born, is that it's

83
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,260
generally short term stressor, stressors
that we define as lasting for minutes or

84
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,210
hours in duration, that actually have
these protective effects.

85
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,760
And that's the way, for the most part,

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,423
mother inten, mother nature intended the
stress response to play itself out.

87
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:42,320
'Kay?
And then the third factor is that we all,

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,410
all biological organisms have an amazing
amount of resilience.

89
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,180
So, we're built to sort of take.

90
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,960
A considerable amount of stress or a
considerable amount of challenge and

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,790
that's the resilience that keeps us going
in even in the face of challenge.

92
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,510
But that it can be, you know, broken down.

93
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,450
And so the, the, the message would be that
yes,

94
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,470
you know stress has a bad reputation and
that's well deserved.

95
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,190
But, it's only one side of the equation,
there is a very important other side of

96
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,150
the equation, the other half of the
equation, if I may.

97
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,340
Where actually, stress can have survivable
promoting beneficial effects.

98
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,750
And you also want to keep in mind, there's
resilience.

99
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,000
So there are mechanisms to sort of,

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,320
keep going, even as you are dealing with a
larger and larger amount of stress.

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,300
But it's better not to, not to push it too
far because the system can break down.

102
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,410
>> Right.

103
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,890
So, so there's that,

104
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,010
there's this other side of stress that
gets less attention, this good side.

105
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,560
And some of your research, as it relates
to the immune system,

106
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,480
has touched on maybe what some of these
positive, these, this good sty,

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,650
side that might be when it comes to stress
physiology.

108
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,500
So.

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,910
What, what would you say are some of the,

110
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,770
the takeaway points, the central
discoveries of your work in that arena?

111
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,620
>> Sure.

112
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,190
So on the good side of stress you know,

113
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,540
there are sort of several central points
that we found.

114
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,650
The first is that we found that during a
short-term stress response,

115
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,150
again you'll specifically define it as
being minutes to hours in duration.

116
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,580
Just always think, fight or flight in
nature.

117
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,160
It doesn't go on and on forever.

118
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,720
I mean, it, it goes on for a short period
of time, and then things come to an end.

119
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,050
During that response, one of the first
things we found is that

120
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,210
there's a large scale redistribution of
the bodies soldiers, or

121
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,790
immune cells, that goes on during this
fight or flight response.

122
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,380
So early during the beginning of the
stress response, and

123
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,250
by early I specifically mean within a few
minutes,

124
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,100
say five minutes to about 15 minutes of
the beginning of a stress response.

125
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,360
You actually have a redistribution of the
body's soldiers, or

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,480
immune cells from their barracks in the
body into the boulevards of the body.

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,480
So the barracks are organs like the
spleen, during, you know,

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,740
in which many, many immune cells reside.

129
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,590
And the boulevards are sort of a poetic
way of saying, blood vessels.

130
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,000
So there's a large scale redistribution,
beginning of a stress response,

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,820
soldiers rush out of their barracks and

132
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,300
enter the boulevards because they have to
go somewhere.

133
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,900
And this registers as an increase in
immune cell numbers in the blood,

134
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,630
early during a stress response.

135
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,560
If you just start out, for example, with
100 units.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,730
Just a general units of, of blood cells at
baseline under resting conditions,

137
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,890
you'll end up with 140 or 150 soon after
the beginning of stress.

138
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,030
But it doesn't stop there.

139
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,180
What happens then is that those cell
numbers slowly begin to come down.

140
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,470
They go back to baseline.

141
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,460
And then they actually start going below
baseline.

142
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,420
So about 20 minutes on out, as the stress
response continues, you know see

143
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,500
a decrease in immune cell numbers in the
blood stream, or the boulevards.

144
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,860
And what that decrease represents is a
redistribution, so the, the,

145
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,320
the soldiers are leaving the boulevards
and

146
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,310
are entering potential battle fields in
the body.

147
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,370
The skin is a very important one.

148
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,520
So, this is summarizing, you know, many
years worth of work.

149
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,630
But this is what we found.

150
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,090
So, there's a redistribution.

151
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,550
Immune cells leave the blood stream, I
mean leave the barracks or

152
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,810
organs like the spleen, enter the
bloodstream, and

153
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,730
then take up positions in potential
battlefields.

154
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,340
So what's going on is that the short term,
or fight or

155
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,570
flight stress response is preparing the
immune system to deal with challenge,

156
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,040
even before any wounding or infection has
taken place.

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,940
And so, you know, someone might ask, but
now wait a minute.

158
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,680
Now, if this system is being prepared for
the lion to attack the gazelle, and

159
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,150
wound the gazelle, how do the immune cells
of the soldiers know

160
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,130
in advance where the lion is going to
attack.

161
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,880
And the point is that the immune cells do
not know a priority,

162
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,420
do not know in advance where the attack
will be.

163
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,410
They're basically fanning out to all
potential battle stations.

164
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,650
If something happens, the acute stress
response has done two important things.

165
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,750
It's made more cell available to fight the
fight,

166
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,590
and it's also enhanced their ability to
fight.

167
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,740
So it increases their effectiveness.

168
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,830
Is there, if there is indeed a battle.

169
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,240
So the, the, the battle vigor is greater.

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,680
If there's no, if there's no wounding or
antigen entry that takes place,

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,650
then within about a few hours everything
just comes back to normal.

172
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,490
So that's, those are sort of the two im,
im,

173
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,970
important things that, that we discovered.

174
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,690
The next sort of aspect of this is that
what we've also begun to show, both in,

175
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,580
in, in our lab as well as other people
independently building upon our work and

176
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,220
replicating it, is that not only is this
going to be really nice interesting

177
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,770
system to, to study but that there is
potential for tapping it clinically.

178
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,640
>> Mm-hm.

179
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,780
>> So.

180
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,860
>> Going from the basic lab studies, we
and

181
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,170
others have been able to show that if you
couple a short term

182
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,370
stress response in a clinically relevant
manner to a clinically relevant outcome.

183
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,790
Such as recovering from a wound healing
after surgery or

184
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,516
amounting a vaccination response following
an immunization.

185
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,960
Coupling the short-term stress response
and adaptive short-term stress

186
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,090
response with those clinical outcomes
enhances those clinical outcomes,

187
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,910
which is you know, likely due to enhancing
immunity in those times.

188
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,950
And then the last major aspect of the work
shows that chronic stress,

189
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,560
that long-term stress, stress that lasts
for months to

190
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,090
years that we talked about earlier seems
to put a damper on all of this.

191
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,280
So we've also found that if you increase
the chronic stress burden

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,850
then the ability of the organism and
perhaps even the patient

193
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,900
to mount the good short term [INAUDIBLE]
stress responses dampen.

194
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,570
And we're still trying to understand
exactly why that might be the case.

195
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,450
>> So this work is really exciting and I
think really interesting and I think

196
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,230
about applying it to my experience getting
sick let's say after studying for an exam.

197
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,750
So, what might be going on where, you
know, I'm stressed out for, for

198
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,000
a few days getting ready for a test, after
which I,

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,900
I experience a more likelihood of getting
a cold or getting sick.

200
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,200
Which is sort of my experience.

201
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,700
>> How often have you really had that?

202
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,920
I've probably had it a couple of times in
life.

203
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,990
So maybe it's not enough times to be a
pattern.

204
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,050
>> We need to understand this phenomenon
because people do experience it.

205
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,090
But one thing to keep in mind, is that we
may be giving it a greater saliance.

206
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,100
So maybe remember the times this happened
more,

207
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,658
than the many many times it didn't happen.

208
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:12,860
The street-bound effect is there, because
many people sort of report it and

209
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,790
remember it.

210
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,660
The key is to keep in mind that it may not

211
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,820
be as frequent as our memories in fact,
make it.

212
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,260
So if you really think back, if you think
back to all the exams you had,

213
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,560
the times you felt sick after the exam,
there's likely to be a minority of times,

214
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,380
that you did, right?

215
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,210
But still, that just puts it in
perspective, that it still happens and

216
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,420
then figuring out what might be going on,
you know, in terms of how it happens.

217
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,050
It's still, you know, something that we
need to work on.

218
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,740
>> Mm-hm.

219
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,040
This is all exciting research.

220
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,100
Tell us a little bit more about what these
future, what the current or

221
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,750
future clinical applications might be.

222
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,590
>> Sure.

223
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,970
You know, we're very, very keenly
interested in taking as much

224
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,850
of our work as we, you know, reasonably
can from the lab to, to the clinic.

225
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,360
Okay, to, to sort of apply it clinically.

226
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,300
And there are several sort of avenues that
are under investigation.

227
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,180
So one is that could we, by understanding
how this fight or

228
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,300
flight stress response when it's mounted
the right way.

229
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Enables or enhances post surgical healing.

230
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
By understanding that, could we harness
this response during different kinds of

231
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,030
surgery to, you know, maximize healing and
recovery after surgery?

232
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,660
One of our studies on surgery and

233
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,150
humans showed that if you take a, take a
number of patients undergoing surgery.

234
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,420
There is a group of them that actually
mounts a very good a priori, so

235
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,850
previously defined adaptive stress
response during surgery,

236
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,170
in terms of this redistribution profile of
immune cells that we talked about earlier.

237
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,770
Those patients who mount that response
generated by the stress of undergoing

238
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,190
surgery, the stress of surgery itself,
actually recover much, much better.

239
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,935
And show much higher recovery.

240
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:02,350
Much, better maximal recovery, compared to
patients who for

241
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,170
some reason, don't mount that good stress
response during surgery.

242
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,970
So in this case, the clinical procedure
itself is the stressor.

243
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,930
Some people mount a good stress response
during that clinical procedure,

244
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,150
in this case it's surgery.

245
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,930
And they recover really well.

246
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,130
Some people, for whatever reason,

247
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,590
don't mount a good stress response during
surgery, and they don't recover as well.

248
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,220
So based on that study, some of our
clinical applications would be,

249
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,550
could we use the ability or not to mount a
beneficial stress response during

250
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,350
surgery as a predictor of how well someone
would do?

251
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,370
Could we, by some chance create the good
stress response.

252
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,880
Create a beneficial stress response during
surgery, for

253
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,930
a patient who's not mounting a beneficial
stress response.

254
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,890
And as a result, give them the advantage
that mother nature has,

255
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,890
has set the system up to give us.

256
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,380
And also, could we understand better, and

257
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,650
this would enable the other, other two,
you know, outcomes.

258
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,930
Could we understand better why some people
are not mounting their adaptive fight or

259
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,670
flight stress response during a medical
procedure like surgery.

260
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,500
Because if we understand what's broken, in
the context of understanding what's

261
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,960
working the right way, you might be able
to fill in the blanks.

262
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,840
And, you know, repair things.

263
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,610
So that's one, you know, example.

264
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,940
The other is to, to couple short-term
fight or

265
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,010
flight stress responses with vaccination.

266
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,140
And use Mother Nature's immune boosting
mechanism to actually boost vaccines.

267
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,410
And so for example, you know one way to do
it,

268
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,513
would be to induce a short bout of
exercise before vaccinating someone.

269
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:33,920
And based on my work and in thinking about
this,

270
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,060
when my kids asked me to run after them if
I take them to the pediatrician for

271
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,350
thier shots I happily do that in the
little playground, you know?

272
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,750
Because, I, I don't think it would hurt.

273
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,430
And it might only help them if their fight
or flight response.

274
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,630
>> It, it might get a lot better for your.

275
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,800
>> Yes, if their fight or flight response
is enhanced.

276
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,350
And I also, you know, film every, every,
every, almost every shot that they

277
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,050
get from multiple angles because I then
use that whilst teaching,

278
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,760
to illustrate how, [LAUGH] Instantaneously
stress responses and

279
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,520
immune activating events are coupled in
nature.

280
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,580
So a baby getting a vaccination is like a
perfect illustration of what happens in

281
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,940
nature again, again, and again.

282
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,900
So typically when your immune systems
activated through wounding or

283
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,970
antigen entry.

284
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,530
You feel the pain and it generates an
instantaneous stress response.

285
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,670
Sometimes your stress response comes
first, and

286
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,860
your immune response follows soon after.

287
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,690
Oftentimes your immune response comes
first, and

288
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,800
your stress response follows, so that
coupling.

289
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,050
So anyway, but those are the ways in which
we want to try to,

290
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,580
sincerely try to harness the basic
research on stress, stress physiology and

291
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,290
how it relates to immune function.

292
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,090
But to harness it directly in a clinical
setting.

293
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,490
And other examples would be, these are
more complicated examples, the two I

294
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,570
gave you for surgery and vaccination have
been translated to, to humans.

295
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,460
The third one is still pre-clinical,

296
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,660
where they're trying to see whether
pulsing the system with these

297
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,410
short term stress responses during the
development of a cancer.

298
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,520
Could actually enhance anti-tumor
immunity.

299
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,450
>> That's fascinating.

300
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,050
>> So these are the ways in which, you
know,

301
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,820
we're sort of grappling with clinical
applications.

302
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,690
>> That's fascinating and one of the
things you said previously is striking me.

303
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,150
So do you have any leads on what might be
broken you say in

304
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,110
the system where patients aren't mounting
this appropriate stress response?

305
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,829
>> This is like still sort of preliminary
you know, work in progress.

306
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,960
One factor appears to be the degree of
chronic or

307
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,210
bad stress that the patient comes into the
surgery with.

308
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,130
Okay and again we still have some work to
do and

309
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,980
we still have to sort of understand this
better but it seems if you put

310
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,220
together the pre-clinical and the clinical
studies together It seems like the greater

311
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,480
the amount of chronic or bad stress that
an individual experiences, the lower their

312
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,835
ability to mount good fight or flight
stress responses when they need them.

313
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,790
Okay?
>> So that gives us an overall,

314
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,500
mechanistically, we still need a better
angle to see what's going on So

315
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,000
one of the things that I very much want to
do is see whether in

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,470
somebody who's not mounting adaptive fight
or flight immune [INAUDIBLE] response,

317
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,490
you could recreate it by sequentially
administering the hormones that mimics.

318
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,170
What would happen during a fight or flight
stress response?

319
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,550
Again, it's easier said than done.

320
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,740
Because we have to understand, we still
have to figure out and see whether that or

321
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
not would be sufficient to create that
response.

322
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,162
Or whether there are other elements of the
response that need to be fixed.

323
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:26,670
All right?

324
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,970
But that's how also, we hope to do an
intervention, where in some cases you may.

325
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,390
The, in some cases, you might be able to
bypass the psychological aspects of

326
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,450
the stressor, and recreate it
pharmacologically.

327
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,770
>> And as a doctor, just go straight in
and turn it on for them.

328
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,520
>> Yeah.

329
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,380
I always believe that the whole package is
the most effective.

330
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,400
But I also believe that if they're
instances in which you could

331
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,380
biochemically replace the whole package.

332
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,330
And if that's the best that's available,
it's still worth pursuing.

333
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,980
And so we, you're really to, you know,
sort of work that out.

334
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,530
>> That seems kind of funny and ironic,

335
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,760
at least, that there's this potential to
harness stress to do good for us.

336
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,030
But because of stress's bad reputation,
we're, in some ways,

337
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,560
we're having a hard time pursuing it.

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,580
>> Yes.
I mean, you, you, you said it really well.

339
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,510
Stresses bad reputation has made my life
quite difficult at times,

340
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,190
and actually quite stressful at times.

341
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,840
>> Yeah.

342
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,460
The irony.

343
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,340
>> Yeah.
>> The irony all the way through.

344
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,370
>> But it's changing and hopefully.

345
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,180
You know, we'll get better.

346
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,420
>> Right.

347
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,305
>> And, and remember that the bad
reputation is well deserved.

348
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,150
Mm-hm.
You know, that also makes it hard.

349
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,700
You know, so that there is a dogma, and
the dogma is that stress is bad, and the,

350
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,970
the problem is that it's not always an
entirely bad, and

351
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,360
that sort of aspect is missed but, but
there's a reason why.

352
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,530
You know, that stress has a bad reputation
because science has, you know,

353
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,310
validated the bad effects of stress.

354
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,860
People can feel them, but at the,

355
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,660
the, again, like I said earlier, there's
the entire other half of equation,

356
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,660
which is actually the reason why mother
nature gave us the response.

357
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,160
That will hopefully, you know, be given
it's sort of fair share of attention.

358
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,550
So your, your suggesting that there's some
good things about stress and

359
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,970
there's some bad things.

360
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,370
So how can I, or people who are watching
in their every day lives sort of use this

361
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,450
model about stress is sometimes good
stress is sometimes bad to live better.

362
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:27,480
So, so you know what, what we've been
doing is Explaining stress,

363
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,310
and studying stress as a spectrum of
possibilities.

364
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,630
Okay?
So at one end of the spectrum, so

365
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,770
to your left, okay, so to my right, if
you're looking at me.

366
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,030
You have your short-term, acute, fight or
flight stress responses.

367
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,850
This is your good stress.

368
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,900
Okay, at the other end of the stress
spectrum you have prolonged chronic long

369
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,430
term stress responses.

370
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,630
That is the well known bad stress.

371
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,750
Again we define the bad stress as
stressors that result in changes in

372
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,170
stress related factors that are prolonged.

373
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,000
So weeks, to months, to years.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Good stress is where the change is pumped
in, so minutes to hours in duration.

375
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,730
And then between these types of stressors,

376
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,470
you have this zone that I call the zone of
low or

377
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,470
no stress, or the green zone, that's kind
of your resting equilibrium, okay?

378
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,940
What you want for good health, and

379
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,340
science seems to be pointing to this from
different directions,

380
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,880
is that what we want for good health is to
minimize the bad stress.

381
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,890
Maximize the green zone, of sort of lower,
no stress.

382
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,740
Because that's the zone you do a lot of
rebuilding, rejuvenation.

383
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,520
Then you want to optimize that fight or

384
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,630
flight stress response, mounting it only
when you really need to.

385
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,780
And making sure you turn it off as soon as
possible.

386
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,500
And all of these things are easier said
than done.

387
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,030
So one has to recognize that.

388
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,860
And that's actually a very important point
when one is dealing with, you know,

389
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,950
stress or sleep problems or anything in
one's life, is to say, you know,

390
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,830
sometimes you'll succeed at handling it
well.

391
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,000
Sometimes you won't.

392
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,070
But the key is not to let stress become a
stressor and

393
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,880
not to become stressed about stress.

394
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,613
You know, for example.

395
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:02,910
So then how do you get to that, to, to, to
that better side of the stress spectrum,

396
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,880
where you basically want to stay in the
green zone as far as possible and

397
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,900
optimize those fight-or-flight stress
responses.

398
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,690
So there seem to be, and again, this is,
you know, some of this is hypothesis,

399
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,880
some of this is, you know, trying to
synthesize, you know,

400
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,260
what is known, and all of it is a work in
progress, okay?

401
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,450
But there are different ways in which you
can stay within that healthy side of

402
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,650
the stress spectrum.

403
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,700
We do believe.

404
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,108
So there are sort of principles, sort of
lifestyles type of ways of which sleep,

405
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:34,760
nutrition and exercise, perhaps in that
order.

406
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,650
Sorry, exercise is third.

407
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,190
Okay, perhaps in that order.

408
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,790
I'm kidding about that order.

409
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,820
But sleep, nutrition, and exercise are
major factors.

410
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,850
So you have a reasonable amount of sleep,

411
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,020
that doesn't mean you have to pull a few
all nighters.

412
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,330
You know you're not going to be keeling
over or anything like that.

413
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,850
But by and large, you have a healthy
amount of sleep.

414
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,600
You sort of, eat in moderation.

415
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,610
Good stuff, and then sort of every once in
a while and

416
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,360
you have a giant chocolate sundae.

417
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,700
And you exercise in moderation, for most
people, who are not athletes.

418
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,030
It could be just, you know Taking the
stairs all, as much as you can, or,

419
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,160
like, you know, walking as much as you can
every day.

420
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,550
That kind, kind of exercise.

421
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,810
Then there are aspects of,

422
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:21,540
of, you know, sort of leading ones life
that also sort of affect this equation.

423
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,800
And, so there are issues like, you know,
having, having certain perspective.

424
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,980
That breeds genuine gratitude for, for

425
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,810
things that are you know worth being
genuinely grateful for.

426
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,000
Hopefully, you know,

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,240
people, most people are going to have some
of those things in their lives.

428
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,680
Genuinely sort of remembering that helps
you deal with the tough stuff.

429
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,280
The stuff that you did have or didn't go
well, so if you can really have

430
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,930
an overall evaluative coping perspective,
this is actually, a do have.

431
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,550
This actually has to be genuine, because
if it's not coming completely from within,

432
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,700
it might not be as beneficial.

433
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,570
also, you know, having a compassionate
sort of lifestyle, a,

434
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,510
a compassionate attitude both towards
others as well as yourself.

435
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,470
I think you know plays a big role in
keeping you towards the good

436
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,460
side of the stress spectrum.

437
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,900
So I think the Dali Lama you know,

438
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,880
is said to have said that if you want
others to be happy practice compassion.

439
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,250
If you want to be happy, practice
compassion.

440
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,690
So there are those aspects.

441
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,510
Then there are individual specific things
that one can do and

442
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,880
again what I'm talking about is what we
believe are avenues that could contribute

443
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,460
to helping an individual stay within the
good side of their stress factor.

444
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,040
So the more individual avenues are things
like whatever works for you.

445
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,210
And those are going to be different
strokes for different folks.

446
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,430
So for some people it could be exercise,
running, over and

447
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,230
above the sort of normal lifestyle
exercise,

448
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,320
it could be actually directed exercise,
going for a jog, running on a treadmill.

449
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,830
It could be meditation for some, yoga for

450
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,990
some, levitation some, you know if people
are so inclined, different things right?

451
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,410
It could be, you know.

452
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,360
photography, art, music, whatever, and the
key then is to find what resonates with

453
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,130
yourself, what really helps, you know,
calm you down, and then practice that.

454
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,530
It doesn't matter.
It could be fishing, you know?

455
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,660
It doesn't have to be running.

456
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,610
It doesn't have to be meditation.

457
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,330
It doesn't have to be the contemplative,
you know, practices.

458
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
Bring this whole equation together, and

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,925
if one can apply it in one's life, as much
as possible again.

460
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:27,270
You know, recognizing that these things
are easier said than done,

461
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,270
recognizing that you might not be able to
strike the perfect balance all the time.

462
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,670
But if you maximize the chances and the
time for

463
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,920
when you can strike that balance, it could
be very useful that's what we feel.

464
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,730
So, as we're closing and wrapping up
today, Professor Dhabhar.

465
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,270
I'm thinking about sort of,

466
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,910
what might be the most excellent point you
want to leave with us today.

467
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,950
If you had a take home message to leave
with our audiences, what would it be?

468
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,900
>> I think about this and

469
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,870
I don't say it exactly the way I'm about
to to my boys who are still little.

470
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,590
But this is still how I really feel in a
larger sense, also.

471
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:13,100
And that is that, the technical message
would be, whether you're dealing

472
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,710
with stress or whatever it is you know,
work hard, but enjoy what you are doing.

473
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,750
Try and do something that, you know, is
useful and

474
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,090
helpful to, to those around you in
addition, you know, to yourself.

475
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,170
Be genuine and

476
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,030
authentic, so you feel a resonance with,
you know, what you are doing.

477
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,680
And you know, in a way sort of the point
of resonance and

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,870
harmony would be what Mahatma Gandhi said
about when he defined happiness,

479
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,210
which was, happiness is when what you
think, say, and do are in harmony.

480
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,520
And you know it, you know?

481
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,320
When it works that way, you know it.

482
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,230
So try to maximize the amount of time.

483
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,270
All your life might not be like that.

484
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,090
And the entire, all the hours in a
particular day might not be like that.

485
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,820
But, as gently as possible to yourself but
as genuinely as possible, try to maximize

486
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,380
your, maximize the time that you can have
that harmony, is what I would say.
