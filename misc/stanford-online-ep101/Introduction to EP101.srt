1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,150
It is a privilege to be here today, to
teach this class that combines so

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,060
many of my passions.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,970
A love of the outdoors, a love of physical
movement, a love of adventure,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,670
a love of science and teaching, and a love
for the amazing capacity and

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,190
resilience of the human body I'm Anne
Friedlander and I along with Corey Dysick

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,690
will be your guide in what I hope will be
a new intellectual adventure for you.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,060
I've been teaching a variety of physiology
type classes at Stanford for

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,850
more than 15 years now.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,210
This is my first online class.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,550
It's also the first time that I've thrown
myself out of an airplane to

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,740
illustrate a point, and

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,030
the first time that the class preparation
may rival the fun of actual teaching.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,210
So it is with great excitement, and

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,970
a bit of relief, that we finally get this
class underway.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,950
Why should you care about environmental
physiology?

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,560
Because it is really about your body in
the world.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,070
Many of you are here because you're
pushing the limits of human performance in

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,770
extreme environments.

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,820
I've heard from students already that have
climbed Mount Everest,

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,790
broken depth records for free diving, and
run ultra-endurance events in

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,630
temperatures that most of us would find
uncomfortable while lying by the pool.

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,550
If you fall into that category, you will
gain new insights about your performance

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,210
and adaptations by learning the underlying
physiology in those environments.

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,700
We will also provide you with practical
tips on how to lessen the negative

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,600
impact of the environmental stresses.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,030
But in addition to the extremes,

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,360
this class is about everyday adventures as
well.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,970
Topics like fatigue in the heat, risk of
hypothermia, and

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,790
the effects of aging on strength and

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,320
cognitive function, are relevant to people
who may never leave their hometowns.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,750
Depending on where you live and what you
do,

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,000
the environmental factors we were
discussing could affect you every day.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
And the aging and

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,310
psychological stress factors are probably
affecting you right now.

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,310
Understanding more about your body, what
makes it tick and

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,450
how to make it run more smoothly can be
inspirational and useful on many levels.

37
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,310
This class is structured around the trials
and tribulations of Corey Dysick.

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,980
Corey was my teaching assistant for

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,490
several years in Exercise Physiology at
Stanford.

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,770
Highly dedicated to his students, he
wanted to enhance his teaching by

41
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,070
brining his knowledge of physiology to a
new level of understanding.

42
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,000
We decided the best way for him to do that
was to experience firsthand how his

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,440
body responded to a variety of stimuli.

44
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,680
What followed was a series of wild and

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,855
crazy, Where's Corey Now, adventures that
we hope will both entertain and teach.

46
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:45,590
Each week in the six-week class, you will
be exposed to a new topic.

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,000
A story video that allows you to
experience the particular environmental

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,270
condition with us will lead off each
section.

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,030
These initial story videos are designed to
inspire questions rather than

50
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,810
provide answers.

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,870
When you see what happens to Corey, we
hope you will want to learn about

52
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,910
the underlying physiology that explains
his experiences.

53
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,890
Other more traditional teaching videos and

54
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,150
learning materials on each topic will then
support the story videos.

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,800
Each section concludes with interviews of
experts in the field as well as

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,030
discussions with adventures who have coped
with extremes that we are,

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,070
that we are talking about.

58
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,140
Everest mountaineers, bad water ultra
distance runners, senior Olympians and

59
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,700
cold weather adventurers, just to name a
few.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,330
Oh, wow, I can hardly wait.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,300
We understand that people are taking this
class for a variety of reasons.

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,940
For example, you maybe a physiology
enthusiast You may be preparing for

63
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,970
a trip to high altitude, or you may just
want to see Corey fly a fighter plane.

64
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,510
Therefore, we understand that you may skip
to one particular section or

65
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,010
only watch the story videos.

66
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,740
You're welcome to do so, but we hope that
many of you will dive deeply into

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,780
the material and give the full class a
chance.

68
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,000
For those that want even more,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,630
we provide some additional resources at
the end of each section.

70
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,930
This class has learning opportunities for
everyone.

71
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,950
There are more details about the format,
requirements for certificates, and

72
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,020
other logistics, in the, Welcome to Class,
document that follows this introduction.

73
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,790
For now, the bottom line is that we hope
that you will learn a great deal over

74
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,180
the next six weeks, and

75
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,940
that you will enjoy watching the videos as
much as we enjoyed making them.

76
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,070
Have fun, study hard, see you soon.

77
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,570
Thanks.
