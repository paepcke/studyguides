1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,940
Welcome back to the physiology of stress.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,890
Today we are going to go straight into the
heart of stress.

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:12,190
We're going to begin our exploration of
how body systems respond to

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,620
stress by looking at how the circulatory
system, the heart,

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,950
its vessels and the other associated
components respond during stress.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,230
So here's our road map for where we're
headed in the mini-lecture.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,100
We will talk about heart rate and stress.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,900
We'll explain Anne's heart rate data.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,250
We'll describe some components of stress
cardiovascular physiology.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,920
And finally, we're going to end with a
really interesting story about stress and

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,630
public speaking.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,140
The heart is one of the most iconic
symbols of all of humankind.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,260
It means a lot of different things to
different people.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,540
To physiologists, it's a hard-working,

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,260
relentless muscle that serves the human
body endlessly.

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,030
Transporting nutrients to capillary
networks, and the tissues of the body

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,340
where the nutrients will be exchanged with
waste that needs to be discarded.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,730
The circulatory system is both the food
caterer and

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,800
the waste management system of energy
breakdown of the muscle.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,890
As such, it's highly responsive to times
of stress when we need access to

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,150
a lot of nutrients and when we need to be
prepared to transport a lot of waste.

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,060
The heart is often one of the first things
that people think about when they

23
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,310
think about what it means to be stressed
in their body.

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,220
Think about the pounding in the ears of
the athlete who is preparing to perform or

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,530
the fluttering in the chest of that
hopeful girl,

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,910
who's crush turns to ask her a question in
the middle of class.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,650
Our hearts are extremely reactive during
the stress response.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,180
Removing parasympathetic break, and

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,480
driving on the sympathetic to elevate
heart rate.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,740
So, here's the main question.

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,850
What does an increased heart rate do for
us?

32
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,460
Well, remember that the circulatory system
has a job to do,

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,358
to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the
muscles so that it can do work.

34
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:22,970
So during a stressful event when the body
is preparing to do a large amount of work,

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,730
it ramps up its delivery and

36
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,290
waste removal system so that the muscles
can get everything that they need.

37
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,080
We call this increase in transport an
increase in cardiac output, or

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,730
the amount of blood leaving the heart.

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,770
An average person has about five to six
liters of blood in their body,

40
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,040
depending on how large they are.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,770
During times of rest that blood, it gets
cycled about once a minute.

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,630
And during times of intense exercise your
body can get that blood to

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,890
cycle six times as fast or

44
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,400
faster, meaning your blood gets circulated
around your entire body every ten seconds.

45
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,270
So in order to increase the cardiac output
to meet your body,

46
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,110
body's needs, the heart, it beats faster.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,720
As you can see next to me, cardiac output
is a function of two variables.

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,680
Heart rate, so fast your heart beats and
stroke volume,

49
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,930
which is the amount of blood that leaves
the heart per beat.

50
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,390
Meaning, more blood leaves the heart,

51
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,860
the more rapidly the heart beats and the
more blood it can inject per unit time.

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,940
The stress response makes the heart beat
harder and

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,000
faster in order to get the blood around
the body quickly.

54
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,450
And this is exactly the physiology we saw
when Anne went

55
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,610
sky diving out of the airplane.

56
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,150
Though her average resting heart rate is
in the mid 50s somewhere we see

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,320
an elevated heart activity pattern at 130
beats a minute as she

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,300
jumps out of the airplane.

59
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,295
If you think about it,

60
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:58,370
it's really pretty incredible how reactive
the stress system is.

61
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,870
Within moments of Anne's brain perceiving
something as stressful,

62
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,920
her heart almost immediately reacts.

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,298
So let's take a look at what happened
here.

64
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:13,050
In the half-hour leading up to the jump
out of the plane,

65
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,770
you see what we call an anticipatory rise.

66
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,510
Anne knows the threat is coming and she
gets more and

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,365
more stressed as she approaches the event.

68
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:26,100
Explaining why she is 30 to 40 beats above
her resting heart rate for

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,740
the entire hour before the jump.

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,640
The three spikes leading up to the jump
represents moments where

71
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,900
an activity happened that triggered fear.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,260
Let's go back in time and take a quick
look at what happened.

73
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,730
So we see the walk out to the plane, take
off,

74
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,370
[MUSIC]
The first opening

75
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,800
of the door as we are ascending in the
airplane.

76
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,620
And finally, the big moment arrives.

77
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,758
>> This is a super bad idea.

78
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:11,309
>> And Dr. Freidlander makes her epically
huge leap,

79
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,202
causing a heart to jump from a rate of mid
90s to a whopping 130 beats [INAUDIBLE].

80
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,945
[MUSIC]

81
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,400
What an incredible thing [INAUDIBLE] to
do.

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,720
Then there's a rapid decline back to 100
beats a minute when the parachute opens.

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,190
And finally, a return to baseline once she
hits the ground.

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,570
In addition to an increase in heart rate,

85
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,130
the smooth muscles in the linings of the
arteries constrict.

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,410
I like to think of the body as a container
of a certain size.

87
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,719
Holding, as we said, about 5 liters or so
of blood.

88
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,940
When you're stressed and

89
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,450
arteries constrict, it makes the size of
that overall container much smaller.

90
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,490
As a result, the pressure in the container
increases.

91
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,640
Hence, an increase in blood pressure in
the body.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,770
This vasoconstriction is an important way
that the body directs blood

93
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,530
resources to the place in the body that
need it.

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,990
The second thing that most people commonly
might think of,

95
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,760
as happening when they get stressed, is
that they start to, to breathe harder.

96
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,670
Breathing harder during stress is a great
example of how interconnected our

97
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,420
systems interact, in order to meet our
needs.

98
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,610
In this case the ventilatory system works
with the cardiovascular system.

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,670
So we know we breathe harder when we are
stressed.

100
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,910
And we certainly breathe a lot harder when
we exercise,

101
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,040
as we saw what happened to Anne in the
stress video.

102
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,600
One reason we increase ventilations is
because we increase the driving pressure

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,940
of oxygen into arterial blood when we
breath more.

104
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,760
The hyperventilation serves another vital
function for the body.

105
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,710
Stress increases ventilation in
anticipation of doing a lot of work.

106
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,810
When your body breaks down the energy it
receives as food, the garbage it leaves

107
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,510
behind in the blood stream is carbon
dioxide and hydrogen ions we call acid.

108
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,240
One way that waste can leave the body is
through the the lungs when

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,330
you [SOUND]
exhale.

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,560
In the case of a serious physical
stressor, like running, you're going to

111
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,709
consume a lot of energy and create a lot
of waste in the blood stream.

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,180
You may have never considered this, but
every time you breathe out you're actually

113
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,490
breathing out the waste that was discarded
from energy that you used in your muscles.

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,030
So nevertheless, a stressed out body means
there will be a lot of

115
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,540
trash piling up in the boulevards of the
bloodstream.

116
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,510
And breathing harder is one of your body's
main strategies for cleaning up that mess.

117
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,040
[BLANK_AUDIO]

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,985
We had a great and

119
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:00,190
a really interesting opportunity to add to
Anne's heart rate data.

120
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,870
And as it turns out it's a really
healthful way to

121
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,820
introduce an important theme of stress
physiology that I

122
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,980
really want you to take away from our time
together.

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,090
To really understand stress, we need to
accept that the mind and

124
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,600
the body are connected.

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,640
And that psychological stressors, like
negative self talk,

126
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,710
public speaking, Imagining bad outcomes
for yourself.

127
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,330
These things turn on the exact same
physical stress systems as

128
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,500
being chased by a bear.

129
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,240
Here at Stanford, Anne was asked to give a
speech, a commencement speech for

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,270
the program in Human Biology.

131
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,450
And in the spirit of this course, which we
were making at the time,

132
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,100
we decided to gather her vitals in real
time as she spoke.

133
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,570
And we were pretty floored by what we saw.

134
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,930
Well, we knew that stress was
psychological and that giving a speech

135
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,960
would turn on her stress systems, but we
were amazed by how much.

136
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,540
To our surprise, we found that Anne's
heart rate data, from giving a speech,

137
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,740
mimics, almost beat for beat, the data we
collected from skydiving.

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,730
Perhaps we shouldn't have been so
surprised,

139
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,710
as public speaking is often listed by
people as one of their greatest fears.

140
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,540
You can see a similar anticipatory rise 30
to 40 beats above baseline,

141
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,560
as she waits on the stage to give her
speech.

142
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,904
Followed by a spike up as the speaker
before her introduced her.

143
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,630
And culminating with a whopping rise to

144
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,000
the same max heart rate she reached while
skydiving, 130 beats a minute.

145
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,720
Our data seemed to suggest that for

146
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,460
Anne, public speaking was every bit as
stressful as jumping out of an airplane.

147
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,050
And keep in mind, Anne speaks publicly for
a living, she's a professor.

148
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,300
Imagine someone who doesn't.

149
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,250
It's no wonder that public speaking is
such a common fear.

150
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,940
What Anne's experience teaches us and

151
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,510
reminds us is that stress is quite a
psychological phenomenon.

152
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,590
We seem to be wired in such a way that our
brains and our bodies can't really tell

153
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,920
the difference between real stressors and
imaginary ones.

154
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,620
This is such an important concept for us
modern day humans and

155
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,920
first world humans because most of our
daily stress is psychological in nature.

156
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,440
So beware, when you stress yourself out
with your mind, your body prepares for

157
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,630
battle, whether you meant it to or not.

158
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,580
[BLANK_AUDIO]

159
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,890
So this concludes our mini lecture on the
cardiovascular system and stress.

160
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
We were built on an understanding that
during stressful times the body needs to

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,270
access a lot of nutrients and unload a lot
of waste in a very short period of time.

162
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,100
As a result, the body systems respond by
increasing heart rate,

163
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,140
stroke volume, blood pressure, and
ventilation rate.

Ann has taught us a lot about stress
already, but

165
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,960

in it.

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,090
So, mobilize your resources, and get
excited.

167
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,390

of the stress response.

168
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,170
I'll see you soon.
