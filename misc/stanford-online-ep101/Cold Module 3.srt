00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,090
Welcome back to the Physiology of Cold,
Module 3- Corey's Data.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,640
In this module, we will take a closer look
at Corey's temperature data,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,790
from his time in the cold room and answer
the pending questions we left you with.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,360
Just a reminder, here are the questions.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,000
Why didn't Corey's core temperature drop
much in the cold water bath?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Why did his temperature drop rapidly on
the treadmill?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,550
And why was it harder for him to control
his hands and

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,950
legs in order to throw the ball and walk
on the treadmill?

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,230
To my right is a graph of Corey's Core
Temperature data as measured by

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,140
the esophageal probe.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,510
Initially he went through an equilibration
period during which time he was

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,750
constricting down his peripheral vessels,
and

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,649
the probe was stabilizing in temperature.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,260
Then he entered the cold bath.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,160
During that time you can see some small
fluctuations in temperature, but

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,370
overall his temperature remained
relatively stable.

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,860
Can you think back to the previous model?

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,040
What was allowing him to keep his core
temperature stable,

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,399
even though he was sitting in a cold bath
of slowly circulating water.

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,120
Well, all those responses we talked about,
vasoconstriction, you can see that

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,650
illustrated in the color of his hands as
viewed through the infrared heat camera.

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,910
He was also shivering off and on.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,723
His core temperature would drop a little
and

24
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:19,516
he'd start shivering, his temperature
would rebound up again and

25
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:22,269
then he'd stop shivering, then down more
shivering, then up.

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,530
The shivering cycle is what gives the
data,

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,390
that undulating line that I just
highlighted in orange.

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,650
But then what?

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,550
He gets out of the tank, starts walking on
the treadmill, and

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,730
his core temperature plummets.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,790
Why on earth does that happen?

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,100
I thought exercise was supposed to keep
you warm.

33
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,450
Well, Corey's cooled limbs were behaving
as a cold sink.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,370
He was sitting in the water with all of
his peripheral vessels constricted down.

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,020
He was successfully keeping the warm blood
in his core, but his legs and

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,790
lower body were getting colder and colder.

37
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,810
If we'd had temperature probes on his
lower body, even right inside the surface

38
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,450
of his muscles, they would have been
measuring close to the water temperature.

39
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,480
Then Corey got up and started walking on
the treadmill.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,490
In order for him to use his leg muscles
for

41
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,540
walking, he had to send blood down into
the area.

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,620
So his warm blood passed through the cold
tissues, and

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,680
brought all that coolness back to the
core.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
There you have it.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,610
Something called after drop.

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,970
And hypothermia ensued.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,660
In Corey's case, you can see that he had
started to turn the corner right

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,930
about the time that we stopped.

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,590
He had reached the point of maximal
shivering, but exercise was starting to

50
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,470
generate more heat, and his temperature
was starting to creep back up.

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,240
He probably wouldn't have gotten much
colder.

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,320
However, you can imagine that after drop
could be quite dangerous for

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,920
someone stranded in severe cold.

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,270
They're huddled in the cold for a long
time, and

55
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,640
then suddenly get up to run after a rescue
plane or some scenario like that.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,800
Their core temperature could get
dangerously low.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,740
The after drop phenomenon is also, it also
plays a cautionary role in

58
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,020
hypothermia first aid, but we will talk
more about that later.

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,520
The previous slide covered two of our
questions.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,890
How did Corey keep his temperature stable
in the bath and

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,550
why did his temperature fall on the
treadmill?

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,440
Now let's address the third question.

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,489
Why did Corey have trouble controlling his
hands and feet?

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,670
Remember in the video, he struggled with
his shoelaces, he was staggering a bit on

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,940
the treadmill, and he actually threw the
ball into the water tank by accident?

66
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,130
When your nerves are cold, they don't work
as well,

67
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,930
in either direction, sensory or motor.

68
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,070
So part of the reason for

69
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,030
diminished manual dexterity is that you
can't feel your fingers and hands as well.

70
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,240
So limited sensory input.

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,030
You can make up for

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,060
it somewhat visually, but if you really
want a challenge, you should

73
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,740
try tying your shoes when your hands are
really cold with your eyes closed.

74
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,320
Also, motor nerve signals going from your
brain to your

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,840
muscles are slowed by the cold,
compromising reaction time.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,400
The slowed nerve signals combined with the
tissue Q10 effect will

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,790
force an awkward change in your patterns
of movement.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,940
The Q10 effect describes the way your body
enzymes behave in

79
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,050
response to temperature changes.

80
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,400
In our bodies, we have a Q10 of about two.

81
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,050
That means for

82
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,880
every change of ten degrees Celsius up,
our enzymes work twice as fast.

83
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,720
On the other hand, for

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,350
every ten degrees Celsius down our enzymes
work half as fast.

85
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,080
The enzymes in Corey's cold legs were
struggling to

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,850
keep up causing each muscle fiber to
produce less force.

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,080
Therefore he had to recruit more muscle
fibers to do the same work.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,050
And here's the thing.

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,450
You have different types of muscle fibers,
Type I and Type II,

90
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,020
and they are good at doing different types
of activities.

91
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,510
Your Type I muscle fibers are what we call
slow oxidative fibers.

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,310
They are used for lower intensity work,

93
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,870
are well equipped to do prolonged
exercise, and are fatigue resistant.

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,570
A motor unit consists of an alpha motor
neuron and

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,965
the muscle fibers it innervates.

96
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,810
Muscle fibers innervated in a motor unit
range in number from under 10

97
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,210
to into the thousands.

98
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,700
Type I motor units are smaller with fewer
innervated fibers per neuron.

99
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,190
This allows you to do more precise
movements.

100
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,010
In contrast, your Type II fibers are your
power and strength fibers.

101
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,460
They're a form of more explosive heavier
work but they fatigue more rapidly.

102
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,400
They are larger motor units having more
fibers associated with each nerve.

103
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,410
When you are cold, you don't get as much
force out of

104
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,470
your smaller type one fibers as you
normally do.

105
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,649
So you need to switch over to your larger
type two fibers at a lower tension.

106
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,450
That is fine except that is harder to do
fine motor movements with your

107
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,510
big power fibers.

108
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,510
So the movement becomes jerky and
uncoordinated.

109
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,410
You'll also fatigue more rapidly.

110
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,620
What is that smell?

111
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,090
Smells like body odor.

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,050
Anyway, this next figure to my right
illustrates the size principle that

113
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,330
we were just talking about indirectly.

114
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,030
Under normal conditions, your body
recruits more and

115
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,480
more fibers as needed, for increasing
muscle tension or force.

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,800
You start off with your smaller Type I
motor units and

117
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,850
then move up to your larger Type II motor
units.

118
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,720
Thus the name, the Size Principle.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,359
In the cold, for reasons we just
discussed, the curve shifts down and

120
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,860
to the right.

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,880
So, for a given muscle tension,

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,580
you are forced to use more of your bigger,
less precise fibers.

123
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,930
So that's why Corey had trouble, walking
on the treadmill,

124
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,830
throwing the ball, and tying his laces.

125
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,800
Please answer the quick check for

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,340
understanding questions, and then, you get
to see Corey warm up.

127
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,690
You'll be glad to know, we didn't leave
him all shivery and cold.

128
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,460
We warmed him up using some groovy
experimental devices to do it.

129
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,630
So check it out in the next module.

130
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,130
Thank you.
