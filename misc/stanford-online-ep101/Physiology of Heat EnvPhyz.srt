1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,490
We're going to see how his body works to
get rid of that heat even when he stays in

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,940
a very hot environment.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,500
And there's some tricks that we're
going to do to try and

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,540
manipulate that process that could be
quite interesting.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,840
So are you psyched for this?

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,960
>> I'm not nervous at all, I'm a
thermoregulatory machine.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,730
>> So where is Cory now?

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,540
Well, here we are back in Craig Heller's
lab, and last time we were here,

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,640
we cooled Cory down, so this time, we're
going to heat him up.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,890
Because they both ways here in the Heller
Lab, they stu-, study hypothermia, so

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,690
low body temperature, and hyperthermia,
high body temperature.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,710
And so, instead of cooling him down,

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,008
we're going to heat him up in the hot room
today.

14
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:39,670
And we're going to see what happens to his
physical performance on a treadmill, and

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,000
then we're going to see how his body works
to get rid of that heat.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,470
Even when he stays in a very hot
environment.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,580
And there's some tricks that we're
going to do,

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,030
to try and manipulate that process that
could be quite interesting.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,650
We're going to put you in a military
thermal insulation suit.

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,710
So, this is what they use when there are
chemical spills.

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,310
And it has some charcoal in it that
absorbs the toxic fumes.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,920
And so that is a partially insulating
suit.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,750
So we're trying to keep that body
temperature in when you're

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,990
on the treadmill.

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,370
You're not going to be able to conduct, or
irradiate, or

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,820
have convection off your skin surfaces
while you're walking on the treadmill.

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,850
And then you walk until you get your core
temperature up to 39 degrees, and

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,980
then after that, we will clamp your
temperature there

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,100
by closing off what surfaces you have left
that are exposed.

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,080
So your face, your hands, your feet.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,330
So we'll clamp those off and we'll see how
it feels for

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,060
you to maintain that core temperature at
39 degrees.

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,170
And then we'll see what happens when we
remove those,

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,830
even if you're still in the hot
environment.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,910
We'll be measuring your core temperature,
like last time, with the esophageal probe.

36
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,660
We'll measure your skin temperature with a
skin probe, and

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,720
we'll measure your heart rate with the
heart rate monitor.

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,670
The three monitors will we able to see how
you're doing physiologically, and

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,420
then we'll throw in some cognitive
performance tests that you'll do

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,900
before you get hot, when you're hot, and
on the other side.

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,910
And we'll see whether that core
temperature change will

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,990
impact your cognitive performance and your
coordination on the test.

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,360
>> Starting to get a little nervous as I
put all these on.

44
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,010
Not really quite sure what Dr. Freelander
might have in store for me.

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,220
>> Here we go.

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,770
Into the hot room.

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,798
Wow.

48
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:22,540
So last time we were in here, it was 40
degrees, and now it's 104.

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,470
Okay, so go ahead and start the treadmill.

50
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,353
>> So three and a half, hows that?

51
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,100
>> Yeah.

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Do we have a core temperature reading?

53
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,490
Feels good, huh?

54
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,330
Just like home.

55
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,190
This is a protocol that they use in this
lab to study the Abacore cooling devices.

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,370
So they get military personnel and
students and

57
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,410
a variety of different populations up to
39 degrees and

58
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,390
then they see how they can manipulate the
cooldown process.

59
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,865
There's a little temperature and humidity
marker over there.

60
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,543
22%, 103 degrees.

61
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:54,590
Whew, toasty.

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,660
>> 158.

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,880
>> 158, a little cardiovascular drift.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,920
You're spiking at 38,3, you're looking a
little sweaty.

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,730
How are you feeling?

66
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,770
>> I'm starting to sweat.

67
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,350
>> Yeah?

68
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,060
>> It's hot.

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,180
>> All for the good of science.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,130
>> I love you students.

71
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,432
>> [LAUGH]
>> Does this mean [CROSSTALK].

72
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,307
>> Okay, so you speaked, you,

73
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,665
you peaked up high enough,
>> Right.

74
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:19,530
>> but we're making sure that it's not
just.

75
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,264
>> Stabilizing [INAUDIBLE]
>> Yeah,

76
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:21,832
we're going to get to the mean at 39 and

77
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,394
then
>> Okay.

78
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:25,926
>> we'll let you get off.

79
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:26,918
All right. 15 seconds. >> Okay.

80
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:30,714
>> You can start bringing yourself down.

81
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:32,142
Get my feet out of the way.

82
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:35,056
Piece de resistance.

83
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:36,634
Careful with the esophageal probe.

84
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,661
>> Yeah.

85
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,823
>> Can you make sure it goes down over?
Oh boy.

86
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,088
>> Just another day in the life.

87
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:43,768
Oh, baby.

88
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:50,184
>> Okay, so we're going to see if your
temperature will stay, just where it is.

89
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:51,131
>> We've clamped.

90
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,556
>> We've clamped.
We've clamped the core.

91
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,411
What we're clamping is temperature, so

92
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:56,437
anytime you lock a physiologic parameter

93
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,430
>> at any certain level, you've clamped
it.

94
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,310
They actually developed this system
because they were trying to

95
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,540
figure out the affect of temperature on
cognitive performance.

96
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,860
But if you take people off a treadmill,

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,630
when you get them to the right
temperature, their core temperature falls.

98
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,180
And so there's no way to stabilize that to
see cognitive function, so they lock them

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,940
in, and then you can do a whole series of
tests and measure the effect that it had.

100
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,340
So that's, that's where this protocol came
from.

101
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,710
>> It looks like you might be stabilizing.

102
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,750
[CROSSTALK]
>> You are stabilizing, yeah.

103
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,780
>> The sweat's starting to come through
your baklava.

104
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,912
>> My baklava?

105
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,750
>> [LAUGH] Or your, your ski hat.

106
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,980
Elite athletes who run a marathon for
example in the heat can get their

107
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,370
core temperature up to about 40 with no
ill effects.

108
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,080
But that's, often people think that that
is the high limit of physiologic capacity.

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,880
So at that point, you start to have
cognitive impairment of performance.

110
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,990
Your body's trying to protect you from
getting your body much higher so

111
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,680
you don't denature your proteins.

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,940
So rarely do people get their temperature
above 40 degrees.

113
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,570
And so we didn't want to take him all the
way to the top,

114
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,810
but 39 is still, still up there.

115
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,090
But not uncommon for athletes to get into
that range.

116
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,620
So you've been clamped now at the same
temperature for.

117
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,840
[SOUND]

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,300
[LAUGH]
Yikes.

119
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,780
For about 15 minutes.

120
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,060
So now we're going to take off the gear.

121
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,600
So even though the room is hotter than his
core temperature right now,

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,410
we'll see whether he can use his
thermoregulatory capacity to

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,590
drop his core temperature down.

124
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,590
>> A drop came when he got off the
[INAUDIBLE]

125
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,520
>> It's a very big relief, already.

126
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
>> Off the treadmill, uh-huh.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,530
Staring at Corey waiting for something to
happen.

128
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,620
His core temperature while he was on the
treadmill walking, going up, up,

129
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,445
up, up, reached a peak there.

130
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:43,580
He got off the treadmill, there was an
initial drop, and then we covered him up,

131
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,640
and he sat there and we clamped the
temperature at about 38.8.

132
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,400
Once you stabilized there,

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,530
it's all the same temperature, uncovered
his hands, his feet, his face.

134
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,675
Those venous anastomoses that serve as
heat shunts in the body.

135
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:02,980
But the thing is that in this particular
case, he is in a room that's

136
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,140
probably warmer than his body temperature,
so we are seeing now a fall in

137
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,920
core temperature and it's interesting to
try and figure out how that's happening.

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,000
The core temperature is dropping now, even
though it's warmer outside than inside his

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,166
body, and now the camera crew is sweating
profusely too.

140
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:20,666
[LAUGH]
>> Oh, yeah.

141
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,940
>> Okay, so it's been 23 minutes

142
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,710
since he's stopped exercising, and he's
just been sitting here the whole time.

143
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,820
His heart rate is still at 162, so you are
working hard.

144
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,852
A lot of cardiovascular drift there to try
and get rid of all that heat.

145
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,000
Your body's looking for a way out for all
that heat.

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,110
Put his hands in cool water,

147
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,670
see if we can get some of that cool blood
back to the core.

148
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,800
Your body is saying, cool me down.

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,088
Save my proteins.

150
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,470
Save my brain-power.

151
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,670
And then, adapt for next time so it's not
as painful.

152
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,090
Restore that homeostasis through a whole
series of adaptations.

153
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,760
And you're going down again, so you had
sort of plateaued again.

154
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,150
>> Yeah.

155
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,520
>> When you took off the gloves and

156
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,119
everything, and now you're starting to
fall again.

157
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,915
>> [UNKNOWN]

158
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:10,790
>> What a good looking curve, so now it's
plummeting.

159
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,530
>> So then, what's more beautiful to you?

160
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,000
A fit in shape 30 year old woman or that
curve?

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,184
>> [LAUGH]
data, data, data.

162
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:29,034
>> Corey's going to do his last cognitive
performance test,

163
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:33,930
his core temperature's come quite a bit
down; I'm going to see how he does.

164
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,480
Okay, so next thing,

165
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,946
we're going to get your body weight
>> Okay.

166
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:43,980
>> see how much you lost and then we'll
give you something to drink.

167
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,520
Feels good out here!

168
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,472
>> Corey
>> [LAUGH] He deserves it.

169
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:55,747
[LAUGH]
>> Thank you.

170
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:13,159
>> Alright
>> So Corey, now that you have survived

171
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:19,378
both the cold module and the heat module,
which was harder for you?

172
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:20,632
>> I suppose they were both,

173
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:23,534
there was very different, opposite ends of
the spectrum.

174
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:26,678
I would say the cold module was harder for
me.

175
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,964
I think part of it, maybe I'm just more
mentally accustomed to

176
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:30,736
heat
>> Mm-hm.

177
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:32,280
>> and so that wasn't as brutal.

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,090
Maybe it had something to do with the
temperature ranges that we chose to hit.

179
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,200
But I would say, I feel like I was
cognitively affected less.

180
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,132
I'm going to recover faster
>> Yeah.

181
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,020
>> after the warm module.

182
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,690
>> Yeah.

183
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,150
I think, in general,

184
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,690
people's bodies are more used to going up
in temperature than they are down.

185
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,273
>> Mm-hm.

186
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:58,260
>> So it's very rare that you let your
body get down to 34.5,

187
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,085
which was what we did in the cold module.

188
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,480
Whereas athletes regularly get their
temperature as high as

189
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,818
you did during an exercise.

190
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:05,480
And so, to

191
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,486
a seasoned athlete like yourself
>> Mm-hm.

192
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:07,900
>> you're probably more used to that
feeling.

193
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,600
>> Mm-hm.

194
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,930
>> Not usually clamping at that
temperature, but sort of less unusual.

195
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,970
And you have more mechanisms in your body
to dissipate that heat once you

196
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,681
get up there
>> Mm-hm.

197
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,340
>> then you do the other way in cold
direction.
