00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:03,820
Welcome back ,the first physical component
we will investigate is

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,570
cardiovascular fitness ,your
cardiovascular fitness can contribute to

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,220
how well you do on certain biking and

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,820
running races but it can also determine
how fast you can work up the flight of

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,470
stairs in your neighbors house and how
winded you are when you get to the top.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,370
We'll see in this module how staying above
a certain critical level of cardiovascular

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,310
fitness can mean the difference between
taking care of yourself, or

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,630
being dependent on others for many of your
care needs.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,440
In this unit, we will also talk about
amazing accomplishments of

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,150
physical performance done by athletes in
their later years, so keep watching.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,400
If we're talking about cardiovascular
fitness, we've got to start with VO2 max.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,320
You probably remember from the cold
section that VO2 max is

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,070
the gold standard for cardiovascular
fitness.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,750
It takes into account your ability to move
air, into and out of your lungs, so

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,040
ventilation, to move oxygen from your
lungs into your blood, to move blood

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,840
through your heart and into your body, and
to extract and use oxygen in your tissues.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,350
The higher your VO2 max,

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,450
the higher the intensity of exercise that
you can sustain.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,150
So, we care about this both as a marker of
overall health, and of fitness.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,730
Let's look at a variety of conditions that
impact VO2 max to

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,400
put the aging effect in context.

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,420
First, training.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,730
Not surprisingly, VO2 max goes up with
training.

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,470
A variety of adaptations that help oxygen
delivery and extraction in the tissues

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,970
will increase your work capacity and your
maximal oxygen consumption.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,800
In contrast, altitude, or low oxygen
pressure, environment will

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,040
reduce the delivery of oxygen in your
tissues, and thus, decrease VO2max.

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,860
And finally, your VO2 max will also down
with aging.

29
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,430
Where it falls in relation to altitude
line and

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,760
your baseline line depends on how old you
are, how high you are and how fit you are.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,390
In the next few slides ,we'll tease apart
how much your

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,200
oxygen consumption will fall with age and
why it falls.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,660
The figure to my right comes from a paper
that was published by Tanaka and

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,890
Seals in the Journal of Applied Physiology
in 2003.

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,230
It shows VO2 max values for
endurance-trained women,

36
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,070
the black dots, and sedentary woman, the
open squares, from age 20 to 75.

37
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:18,370
The dat, data gives us a good sense of
what happens to VO2 max as we age.

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,470
There are several key points here.

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,740
First, there's a lot of variability at
every age, but

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,770
the values in both groups clearly decline
with age.

41
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,180
On average, it is estimated that aerobic
capacity will decline about 1% per year,

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,170
after your mid-20's.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,130
Second, regardless of age, for

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,210
the most part, the trained women have
higher VO2 maxes than the untrained women.

45
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,620
For example, that one seven year old woman
to the right of the graph has

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,480
a VO2 max that is almost twice that of
some of those 30 year old sedentary women.

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,650
So age plays a role in determining aerobic
capacity, but

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,420
is certainly not the only factor.

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,670
The third thing to notice is that there
seems to be a convergence of the lines.

50
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,700
Meaning the trained folks seemed to be
losing at a faster rate and

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,320
the lines are getting closer together.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,090
Can you think about why that might be?

53
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,900
Well, there was more than just aging
physiology going on there.

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,200
As many of you out there may have
experienced,

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,999
it is really hard to train like you used
to when you were young.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,870
Between the reduced time availability, the
increased recovery time, and

57
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,070
the decreased motivation to train in many
cases,

58
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,660
it's very difficult to put in the same
number of hours and intensity of training.

59
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,870
I'll show a, show you a bit more about
detraining in the next slide, but

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,929
you get the idea for now.

61
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,020
Let's say you're going through life,
getting older, you're fit and

62
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,500
training hard, but your friend is
completely sedentary.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,910
Which one of you will notice first the
change over time in VO2 max?

64
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,600
Well, you probably will.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,820
As an athlete who has trained hard, you
will notice pretty early that you

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,340
can't quite keep up with that old race
time and

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,680
that high end effort gets harder to
sustain.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,460
That can be frustrating, but the problem
for

69
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,710
you friend is that, she may not notice the
fall in her capacity until it's too late.

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,160
There's a critical thresh hold of
disability around 18 mils per kilogram,

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,710
per minute, below which it is really hard
to do your activities of daily living.

72
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,450
Those open dots below the red dashed line
have

73
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,220
crossed that thresh hold of disability.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,170
We've tested older women in my lab who
have had VO2 maxes in the range of 14.

75
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,930
That's equivalent to walking very slowly
on a treadmill with no grade.

76
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,140
And it is, and that's their maximum, so it
can't be sustained for very long.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,490
What happens if those women want to carry
their groceries or

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,270
get out of the way of a bus?

79
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,360
It's important to think about this
throughout your life, so you can be one of

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,670
those black dots and not one of those open
dots below the threshold of disability.

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,790
Ha, freaked you out.

82
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,170
I'm on the other side of the slide now and
you didn't even see me move.

83
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,980
Faster than a speeding bullet.

84
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,919
Just thought I'd be wild and crazy and mix
it up a bit.

85
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,760
Okay, let's tease apart the influence of
training on age and VO2max.

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,040
To my left is a graph of VO2max versus age
for three different groups.

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,300
The lowest line, blue, is the untrained
group, green is the fitness range,

88
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,300
recreational athletes, and black
represents competitive runners who can't

89
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,290
keep up their earlier lev, earlier level
of training Similar to the previous graph,

90
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,170
you got a convergence of those lines.

91
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,130
However, if those elite runners were able
to train as hard as they did when they

92
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,880
were younger, the VO2 max would still fall
off but no faster than the other groups.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,930
In contrast, if they were to stop training
in their early 30's and never train again,

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,970
They would lose a lot of that base that
they had built up in their youth.

95
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,260
So the expression, use it or lose it, is
definitely true.

96
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,110
What about gender differences?

97
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:05,000
To my, left is a representative line of
VO2 max versus age for men.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,309
Let's add women onto the graph.

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,540
As you can see,

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,100
there's nothing physiologic that causes
women to lose aerobic capacity faster than

101
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,470
men if they were to keep up their training
as much as the men.

102
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,040
However, there can be some accelerated
muscle loss, circulatory adjustments and

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,669
body composition changes around the time
of menopause.

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,800
The problem, is more that on average,
women tend to

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,940
start with low aerobic capacity, and live
longer than men, therefore they

106
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,620
run a greater risk of dropping below that
critical threshold of disability.

107
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,750
Unfortunately, that results in more women
needing care in their later years and

108
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,769
ending up in nursing homes.

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,050
A 2005 paper by Gewirtz in the Journal of
Women's Health reported that

110
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,300
among residents of US nursing homes,

111
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,900
age 75 to 84, for every 100 men there were
246 women.

112
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,100
And among those greater than 85, for every
100 men there were 425 women.

113
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,010
That ratio's almost twice as much as the
same age groups in the general population.

114
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,790
You have to remember though, that these
are average values, and

115
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,270
it is not necessarily destiny.

116
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,060
I was giving a talk on this topic to a
group of older adults.

117
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,680
And when I got to this slide, I asked the
question, who is more at risk,

118
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,270
men or women?

119
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,330
One woman spoke up and said,

120
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,640
men are definitely more at risk because
they sit at home all day eating chips and

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,730
watching football, while the women are out
cooking and cleaning and doing errands.

122
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,680
It was obviously not the answer that I was
expecting, and everyone sort of chuckled.

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,110
But I thought about it more and

124
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,270
I realized that there was a lot of truth
in that comment, meaning,

125
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,780
that no matter what the graphs or the data
say you have some control over your aging.

126
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,390
In their house, if what she said is true,

127
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,840
she will probably be healthier than her
husband in the long run.

128
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

129
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,890
So here we are ,back at the Fick Equation.

130
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,340
What better way to figure out why VO2 max
declines with age than to

131
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,310
tease apart the components that actually
determine VO2 max.

132
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,250
As you look at this equation ,which
factors do you think decline with age?

133
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,650
Is it heart rate ,Stroke volume, the
amount of oxygen in the arterial blood,

134
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,640
the amount of oxygen that the body's
extracting, well the answer is,

135
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,630
drum roll please, yes.

136
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,530
Yes.
All of the above.

137
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,840
Everything goes down, let's look more
closely.

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,760
You probably already know that max heart
rate declines with age,

139
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,830
even if you've never really thought about
it.

140
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,760
Have you heard of the formula that your
max heart rate is 220 minus your age?

141
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,930
That's based on estimates that your heart
rate goes down about one beat per year.

142
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,550
It turns out that,

143
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,440
that formula underestimates heart rate max
for older adults.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,910
A new and improved formula is listed on
the slide to my right.

145
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,489
It is based on a large data set of people
over wide ranging ages.

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,810
The reason for the fallen heart rate over
time is still unclear, but

147
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,540
it seems to be a combination of the
decrease of the intrinsic rhythm of

148
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,780
the heart as well as decreased
responsiveness of

149
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,770
the heart to stimulation, in this case
beta Adrenergic stimulation to be precise.

150
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,409
The fallen, the fallen max heart rate is
independent of gender or fitness.

151
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,370
Stroke volume, the other component of
cardiac output is the amount of

152
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,570
blood pumped from the heart per beat.

153
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,260
It declines with age for the reasons
listed on the slide to my right.

154
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,910
Basically, the heart becomes less elastic,
beats less hard, and has more resistance

155
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,059
to emptying over time thus reducing the
amount of blood it can expel per beat.

156
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,020
The amount of oxygen your tissues extract
during max exercise also declines.

157
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,110
First ,there's less oxygen delivery to the
tissues due to

158
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,910
less blood flow to active tissues and less
hemoglobin to carry the oxygen.

159
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,880
And second, there's less removal of oxygen
that does arrive in the working

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,350
muscles because an older adult There are
fewer mitochondria to use the oxygen.

161
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,210
Finally, the ventilatory reserve that you
started out with in your youth will start

162
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,740
to wane as you damage the surfaces of your
lungs over time, especially if you smoke.

163
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,050
Various other changes to the lungs also
take place that make sustained,

164
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,839
high rates of ventilation more difficult.

165
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,070
But here's the thing, all of the age
related changes I

166
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,280
just described except maximum heart rate,
can be at least slowed,

167
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,920
if not stopped, with a lifetime of
regular, sustained endurance training.

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,140
Basically, from the heart to the lungs to
the blood to the tissues, it's all good,

169
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,780
and can slow the trajectory of aging.

170
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,690
However, because of the decline in max
heart rate, that is

171
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,610
not impacted by training, there will be a
fall off in maximum aerobic capacity,

172
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,730
even if you are able to train hard enough
to arrest some of the other changes.

173
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,230
Sorry.

174
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,310
But at least now you can answer one of the
corey questions about what is inevitable,

175
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,710
and what can be improved by regular
endurance training.

176
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,630
In the category of aerobic capacity, max
heart rate is the one stubborn outlier.

177
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,930
So the bad news is that, even if you were
training as hard as you were

178
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,310
when you were young, you still will lose
some aerobic capacity.

179
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,680
And, because the recovery time issues and
the poor repair mechanisms,

180
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,730
it also will be hard for you to fully
maintain your training.

181
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,380
But, the good news is that whenever you
are, whether you're a casual exerciser, or

182
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,230
an elite athlete, regular physical
activity will help you maintain your

183
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,020
functional capacity and performance as you
age.

184
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,990
Even with the age related decrements that
we've been talking about,

185
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,450
older adults are capable of amazing
accomplishments.

186
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,600
For example, let's look at the Hawaii iron
man.

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,510
This is the ultimate triathlon prize, and
requires swimming 2.4 miles in the ocean,

188
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,345
riding a bike for 112 miles, and then
running a marathon, so

189
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,880
26.2 miles, across the hot lava fields on
a big island of Hawaii,

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,450
all that in average temperatures 86
degrees Fahrenheit, and 70% humidity.

191
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,240
The cutoff for finishing is 17 hours.

192
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,250
Can you imagine doing that kind of
strenuous activity for 17 hours straight?

193
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,500
Actually, probably some of you ,folks out
there have done it and more but, for

194
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,840
the rest of us that is tough stuff.

195
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,199
Anyway, guess the age of the oldest man
and woman to complete the race.

196
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,710
Lew Hollander, at age 81, completed it
with 14 minutes to spare in 2011.

197
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,860
Amazing, 81.

198
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,930
Lew claims his secret is to go anaerobic
every day, meaning he pushes his upper

199
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,639
limit of intensity every day to prevent a
slow decline in capacity as he ages.

200
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,430
And then, there is Sister Madonna Buder,
the flying nun.

201
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,630
She started running in her 50's and has
been competing in races ever since.

202
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,040
She became the oldest woman to complete
the Hawaii Iron man at age 75, and

203
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,790
then beat her own record at age 76.

204
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,120
She also completed the Canada Iron Man at
age 82 in 2012 now

205
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,710
making her the oldest person to have
completed any Iron Man.

206
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,460
You go sister.

207
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's go over the key points from this
module.

208
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,230
VOx max declines on average about 1% per
year after a peak value in your 20's.

209
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,510
Many factors contribute to the decline in
aerobic capacity like maximum heart rate,

210
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,570
heart elasticity and oxygen transport.

211
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,730
Values for trained and

212
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,090
untrained people decline about the same
right, rate if training is continued.

213
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,139
But it is very hard to keep up those
training levels.

214
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,210
Men and women decline at the same rate,
but women start lower and

215
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,240
live longer, so they're more at risk for
long term disability.

216
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,460
And, physical activity is critical to
maintaining optimal aerobic

217
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,070
function throughout our lifespan.

218
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,110
Okay, that's it for module three.

219
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,350
Complete the check for understanding
questions and move on to module four to

220
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,820
find out how your muscles fare during the
aging process.

221
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,180
Thank you for your continued interest.
