1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,230
Pike's peak.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,900
We had some kind of fun on the mountain
during filming.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,160
Reminds of those summers I used to spend
up there working my tush off with

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,540
the research team.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,190
Actually, to be honest, it wasn't all that
pleasant this last visit,

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,760
because we didn't have much time to
acclimatize.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,290
After spending whole summers up there,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,120
I had forgotten that the first couple days
are not so fun.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,010
Right when Corey and I started feeling
good again, it was time for us to leave.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,420
Oh well, it was worth it just to watch
Carlos and Wes getting all queasy and

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,740
hypoxic behind the cameras.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,670
So let's find out what was going on up
there.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,220
In module three, we talked about the
changes that occur in the first few hours.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,490
Now we are going to move onto chronic
adaptations to altitude.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,200
In this picture Corey is looking not too
happy, but

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,730
definitely less stressed than in the acute
changes module.

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,650
Right away in the first 48 hours, several
things occurred to make him feel, and

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,490
perform slightly better at altitude.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,850
Again, an early priority is to get more
oxygen into the blood.

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,990
A reduction in plasma volume within the
first 48 hours hemoconcentrates the blood,

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,450
so there are more red cells per unit
blood.

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,830
As a result, hematocrit, or the percent of
red blood cells, will be higher, and

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,440
the blood will carry more oxygen.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,780
However, a negative consequence of the
plasma volume loss is a reduction in

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,540
cardiac output.

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,670
There is a relationship between plasma
volume and stroke volume.

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,990
If you decrease plasma volume, there is
less blood returning to

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,180
the heart; therefore, less blood leaving
the heart at every beat.

29
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,080
Also, within the first 48 hours, there
will be a spike in Epo,

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,490
which will start the production of new red
blood cells.

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,420
You probably have heard of Epo in the
context of blood doping,

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,190
especially cycling.

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,090
Athletes take it to increase red blood
cell production so

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,030
they can carry more oxygen to their
tissues during competition Effective, but

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,940
dangerous, and a banned activity.

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,910
Also in the process of getting rid of
plasma volume,

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,930
you excrete some bicarbonate from your
blood buffering system.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,240
The bicarbonate buffering equation is
explained in the glossary.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,550
But essentially, you just need to know
that by having less bicarbonate in

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,650
your system more CO2 is available in your
blood and your blood remains more acidic.

41
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,860
We know from our previous discussions that
more CO2 and

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,450
more acidity means up regulation of
ventilation.

43
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,510
And up regulation of ventilation will get
more oxygen into the lungs and blood.

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,620
The added acidity will also help to
correct the oxyhemoglobin dissociation

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,870
curve back to the right which will
facilitate the unloading of oxygen in

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,460
the tissues 2,3 DPG a metabolism byproduct
is released

47
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,859
from the red blood cells to further shift
that curve back to the right.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,030
Another way to get more blood to the
tissues is to further increase blood

49
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,270
pressure, to help perfusion and diffusion.

50
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,040
The adaptations that have occurred up to
this point combine to

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,220
reduce the stress associated with
altitude.

52
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,670
It's getting easier compared to the acute
exposure.

53
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,250
So, resting at submaximal heart rate will
fall relative to acute.

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,720
Interestingly max heart rate will also
fall at this stage and

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,780
continue to fall slightly over a prolonged
stay at altitude.

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,970
Perhaps it is a protective mechanism
dating back to our days in

57
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,155
the hypoxic utero when we were protecting
ourselves from low oxygen availability.

58
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:33,759
Don't squirm too much because there's not
enough oxygen to go around.

59
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,170
Okay.
So a couple of days pass, Corey and

60
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,850
I are just starting to feel good.

61
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,360
If we'd stayed longer,

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,920
some of the big time adaptations would
have started to kick in.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,170
The long term adaptations require protein
or structural changes that are slow to

64
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,550
happen, but they stick around longer when
they do.

65
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,080
For example, the blood changes continue.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,540
But after three to four weeks instead of a
quick fix of decreasing plasma volume

67
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,240
the new red blood cells have started to be
released making it a more stable change.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:14,210
A typical response pattern in hematocrit
the percent

69
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,850
of red blood cells in the blood Can be
seen in the graph on your left.

70
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,200
Hematocrit may start around 43 in a young
man at sea level.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,140
After a couple of days on the peak with
the loss of plasma volume,

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,200
maybe it'll jump up to 45.

73
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,380
Then, after four weeks,

74
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,420
it gets even higher as more red blood
cells are formed and released.

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,840
However, the degree of response varies
from person to person, and

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,380
that variability may help explain why some
people benefit from altitude training, and

77
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,780
others do not.

78
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,660
More on that later.

79
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,370
Finally, as you stay longer in altitude,

80
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,800
your body will work to minimize the
diffusion distance in the tissues.

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,440
In this way, oxygen will not have to
travel as far within the cell to

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,370
get where it needs to go.

83
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,790
This is accomplished in several ways.

84
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,170
First, by increasing levels of myoglobin
within the muscle cell.

85
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,990
Myoglobin is similar to its cousin
hemoglobin, in that it transports oxygen.

86
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,080
But instead of being in the blood, it
works in a cellular environment.

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,400
It also serves as a cell storage for
oxygen when it is not being used.

88
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,460
Second, there may be an increase in
mitochondrial density and

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,120
aerobic capacity.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,020
That is controversial.

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,620
You might think it seems strange that you
would increase mitochondria,

92
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,832
your powerhouse organelles where you use
oxygen.

93
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:38,460
What is really oxygen delivery, and not
use that is limiting at altitude.

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,430
You have plenty of mitochondria at sea
level to use,

95
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,600
the even greater amount of oxygen that is
available.

96
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,050
But there is some indication that the low
oxygen levels in the cell at altitude,

97
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,420
may be sensed by your metabolic pathways
as a training stimulus.

98
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,020
Your cells are saying, make more energy
now.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,580
And one of the best ways to do that,

100
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,380
in the long term, is to increase your
mitochondrial density.

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,850
The increased density also decreases the
diffusion distance,

102
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,210
because there is more machinery around to
access.

103
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,040
The data are mixed on this issue.

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,360
A synthesis of the literature suggests the
following.

105
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,250
If you are exercising at moderate
elevations,

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,810
there seems to be an increase in
mitochondrial density.

107
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,870
On the other hand, if you are sedentary at
moderate elevations, there doesn't seem to

108
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,868
be enough stimulus to start the
mitochondrial bio genesis process.

109
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,820
And finally, if you are at extreme
elevations,

110
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,520
there is plenty of stimulus but you're in
a too much of

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,770
a catabolic state to be able to respond by
creating much of anything new.

112
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,720
You're breaking down tissues instead.

113
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,610
The last thing on the list is increased
vascularity which creates more vessels per

114
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,320
unit of muscle.

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,540
We definitely see this in high altitude
natives or in situations where animals,

116
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,890
like chicks are raised experimentally in
low oxygen environments.

117
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,710
Hypoxia stimulates angiogenesis or the
formation of new vessels.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,140
However, with lowlanders going to altitude
it may be that there is a loss of

119
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,970
muscle mass which increases the capillary
to fiber ratio.

120
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,160
Independent of actually forming new
vessels.

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,890
So all these adaptations get us to the
ultimate prize, Mount Everest.

122
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,722
We started off talking about John Krakauer
in his plane flying to Nepal and

123
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:28,190
realizing that he would die if his plane
depressurized at that elevation of

124
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,360
Mount Everest.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,190
And now we've arrived at the point where
we can discuss people climbing that

126
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,830
same mountain without supplemental oxygen.

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,030
Now Everest is too high to just go and
hang out until you climatize.

128
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,140
It is up in the death zone, where as it
sounds, if you stay too long,

129
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,680
you will not survive.

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,540
but, climbers have devised a way to go up
for a while, and

131
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,890
come back down to recover.

132
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,020
Go up again, and come back down.

133
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,060
So on, and so forth.

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,250
As many of you know, the first pair to
successfully climb the mountain and

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,822
make it back down was Hillary & Tensing in
1953.

136
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:04,540
You can see in the figure to my right that
the successful climb was

137
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,840
more than 30 years after the first group
that we know of tried to climb it.

138
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,660
Oxygen was first used in an attempt in
1922.

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,510
Over the years researchers had done the
calculations and determined that it

140
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,830
was not hu, humanly possible to climb the
mountain without supplemental oxygen.

141
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,948
Meaning that the arterial saturation value
in the thick equation would be too low for

142
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:29,190
anyone to actually be able to survive up
there.

143
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,000
So surprise, surprise when Reinhold
Messner did it in 1978,

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,480
people didn't believe him.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,050
They thought that he'd been sucking oxygen
out of the emergency bottles.

146
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,530
But lo and behold, he went back up again
in 1980, not only proving he didn't

147
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,830
need oxygen, but also accomplishing the
first solo ascent of the mountain.

148
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,470
Well it turns out that, that original
estimate of barometric pressure on

149
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,920
the top of Everest was low by about 17
millimeters of mercury.

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,330
Apparently, the proximity of the mountain
to the equator had not been

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,410
taken into account.

152
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,150
Which increases the pressure slightly.

153
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,860
And that little difference was sufficient
to drive just enough oxygen into

154
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
the system to make the climb possible.

155
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,090
Even so, it is right on the limits of
human performance and

156
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,129
very few people are capable of doing it.

157
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,690
The use of oxygen to climb Everest has
always been controversial.

158
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,890
At first it was thought to be cheating and
unpure.

159
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,210
For awhile, it became a mute point when it

160
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,290
was thought that the mountain couldn't be
climbed without it.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,190
The controversy is now back in the
forefront because the sheer numbers of

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,120
people attempting to climb the mountain
and

163
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,360
the number of people that are dying
because of it.

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,020
Many argue that the oxygen allows people
to attempt the climb even...

165
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,250
Though they have no business being on such
a treacherous and challenging mountain.

166
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,080
These days, if you have the cash, you can
find someone to take you up.

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,960
And too often, that ends in tragedy.

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,420
Just a little side note for those that
are, don't know the mountain lore.

169
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,480
On the slide, I've listed Mallory and
Irving in 1924 with a question mark.

170
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,910
To this day we don't know whether they
made it to the top.

171
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,240
They were last seen through binoculars on
the final pitch before the summit.

172
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,060
But they never came back down.

173
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,640
People were convinced that they had
actually summoned the mountain.

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,620
In 1999 an expedition went back to try to
recover the bodies and

175
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,520
find some clues like an old camera that
might put the speculation to rest.

176
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,430
They did find the bodies at 27,000 feet,
but no camera and

177
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,740
no indication from where they fell.

178
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,400
I guess we will never know.

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,970
Fascinating.

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,050
That is it for the adaptation modules.

181
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,280
Next we will get to apply what we learned,
to Cory's data.

182
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,740
Also we will discuss how the altitude
impacted his exercise performance.

183
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,140
Feeling of well being.

184
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,900
Sleeping.

185
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,110
Oh, and the peeing and farting.

186
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,610
Thank you.
