1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,890
We hope you enjoyed watching Corey get
cold.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,170
There were some interesting surprises in
how his body responded to the cold.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,900
And we'll explain why those occurred in
one of the upcoming modules.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,240
Before we get started with the material
though, let's take a look at a series of

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,800
questions that we will address throughout
this physiology of cold section.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,310
Of course we will answer the questions
that we left you with at the end of

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,480
the Corey gets Cold video.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
Why didn't Corey's core temperature drop
much in the bath?

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,090
Why did his temperature drop rapidly on
the treadmill?

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,090
And why was it harder for

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,960
him to control his hands and legs as he
started to cool down?

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,050
But also in this section,

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,980
we will talk about what factors determine
whether you get cold?

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,790
How your body responds when it is cold?

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,980
How your exercise performance is impacted
by cold conditions?

17
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,980
What are the ways that you can adapt to
make cold less stressful?

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,940
We'll talk about cold related risk such as
hypothermia, frostbite and

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,080
cold water immersion, and what you can do
to prevent them?

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,390
And then we'll talk about the interesting
phenomenon of paradoxical undressing, and

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,350
who knows, if we're lucky, maybe we'll
even get a demonstration of it.

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,610
To my right is the organization of the
modules within this section that

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,930
will help us answer those questions that
we just laid out.

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,130
You've already seen the Corey Gets Cold
Module, so next we

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,860
will move on to acute responses, and then
Corey's Temperature, Data, and Questions.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,100
After that, you get a bonus story video
where you get to watch Corey warm up.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,130
After he warms up, we'll move on to
exercise in the cold,

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,830
chronic exposure, and risks, consequences
and practical tips.

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,559
Okay then, let's get started with module
two: Acute responses to the cold.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,880
First, a bit about body temperature
balance.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,050
As you probably know, core temperature in
humans is regulated around

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,150
37 degrees Centigrade or 98.6 Fahrenheit.

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,440
Core temperature is a little cooler in the
mornings and

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,170
gets higher during exercise or with a
fever.

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,050
Can also be impacted by things like,
hormones, menstrual cycles,

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,000
illnesses, problems with your thyroid,
ovulation, drugs, and many other things.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,480
But the bottom line is that your body
works hard to keep core temperature in

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,120
a relatively tight range when possible for
optimal functioning of body systems.

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,960
Heat gain comes from two sources.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,560
The internal generation of heat and the
heat from the environment.

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,440
As homeotherms, we humans use metabolic
activity to regulate our

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,029
body temperature usually at a temperature
higher than the surrounding environment.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,480
Every metabolic reaction that takes place
in our body is only about 25% efficient.

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,100
That means that 75% of the energy used to
do the reaction is given off as heat.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,090
We trap a portion of that heat as needed
in our body to keep ourselves warm.

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,040
We're also constantly losing heat to the
environment through radiation, conduction,

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,440
convection and evaporation.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,290
Radiation is the loss of heat through
infrared rays.

49
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,250
Conduction is the transfer of heat between
solid materials like sitting on

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,860
a cold bench.

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,400
Convection removes heat with the flow of
air or water across our skin.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,500
And evaporation is the loss of heat
through a phase change from liquid to gas,

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,190
like with sweat.

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,090
The four methods of heat transfer take on
a different level of

55
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,570
importance based on multiple factors such
as ambient temperature,

56
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,540
clothing, humidity, and exercise.

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,510
On this slide,

58
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,800
we will discuss what determines how cold
you get in a particular environment?

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,000
You can think of these items as risk
factors for hypothermia.

60
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,780
The first category we'll discuss is the
most obvious: environmental factors.

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,870
Clearly the colder the ambient temperature
the more likely you are to feel cold, and

62
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,610
then to eventually get cold.

63
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,230
We need to experience a fall in core
temperature known as hypothermia.

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,390
Whether you're in the water or air also
makes a difference.

65
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,610
Water conducts heat away from the body 25
or more times faster than air,

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,050
thus shortening both time to hypothermia
and survival time.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
Movement of the air or wind across your
skin means more air

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
molecules touching you, so faster removal
of heat.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
The air that is warmed by your skin then
moves on being replaced with

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
colder air which again draws heat from
your body.

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,630
There are charts available online that
show how much colder it feels for

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,700
a given temperature and wind speed.

73
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,978
For example, a temperature of 15 degrees
Fahrenheit will feel like minus two in

74
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:31,680
a 20 mile an hour wind, and a minus eight
in a 40 mile an hour wind.

75
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,090
You saw a more minor illustration of this
when Corey got into the water bath.

76
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,980
Remember when he complained about the
water pump being on?

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,250
Accidentally on, I might add.

78
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,210
Anyway, he said something like, the
courage is the worst part, and

79
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,590
then, oh, that's so brutal.

80
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,670
It felt much colder for him when the
warmed water around his

81
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,430
skin was moved away and replaced with more
cold water.

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,290
Individual characteristics.

83
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,480
Age.

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,160
Kids and adults over 60 have more trouble
staying warm.

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,260
You may have seen this illustrated in your
family: parents, grandparents, children,

86
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,710
et cetera.

87
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,510
Older adults have a compromised ability to
vasoconstrict peripheral vessels, so

88
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,140
they lose more heat to the environment.

89
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,370
They also tend to have a lower metabolic
rate so

90
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,540
they produce less internal heat to start
with.

91
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,720
On the other hand, kids actually have a
higher metabolic rate relative to

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,050
their size, but they also have a higher
surface to volume ratio.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,700
The increased surface area means that they
lose more heat to

94
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,569
the environment relative to the amount of
body tissue they have generating heat.

95
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,890
Gender.

96
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,390
Women have certain advantages when it
comes to staying warm, because they on

97
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,080
average have more subcutaneous fat, that
serves as an insulating layer.

98
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,370
On the other hand, women, and again it is
on average have less muscle mass and

99
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,839
a higher surface area to volume ratio,
because we tend to be smaller than men.

100
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,420
Body size, we just discussed.

101
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,840
So bigger and thicker equals higher heat
retention.

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,820
Muscle mass is also very important.

103
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,260
Muscle is the most metabolically active
tissue in your body.

104
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,840
The more muscles you have, the more
cellular work, and

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,040
the more heat generated.

106
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,210
Next category is insulating factors.

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,800
First is the amount of subcutaneous fat
you have.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,540
Just like elephant, seals and whales have
a lot of blubber to protect them

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,160
from frigid ocean temperatures, we too
have insulating layers that keep us warm.

110
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,610
Not that I'm calling you an elephant seal.

111
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,830
Think of subcutaneous fat as Styrofoam cup
around your coffee.

112
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,230
Both are effective insulators, but not
terribly desirable these days.

113
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,190
In the video, Corey didn't have much fat
to insulate him from the surrounding cold.

114
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,055
Clothing is next.

115
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,300
Corey didn't have a lot of that either.

116
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,850
Clothing is our most effective way to
insulate ourselves.

117
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,730
We know from a very young age that some
clothes are warmer than others.

118
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,370
This has to do with the clo rating of the
clothes.

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,150
Just an FYI, one clo represents the
thermal insulation sufficient to

120
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,740
keep a resting person warm at 20 degrees
centigrade,

121
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,649
with less than 50% humidity, and a wind at
six meters per minute.

122
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,020
The colder the temperature and

123
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,120
the less active the person, the higher the
clo rating needs to be.

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,830
It is important to dress in layers during
activity,

125
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,640
because sweat will lower the insulating
capacity of clothing,

126
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,820
which brings us to the next item on the
list, wet versus dry.

127
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,210
Intuitivelly, we all know that wet clothes
do not insulate as well.

128
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,020
Have you heard the expression cotton
kills?

129
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,340
This is because cotton has branchy fibers
that soak up moisture like a sponge and

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,960
hold it next to your skin,

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,860
preventing you from forming a warm
insulating layer around your body.

132
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,870
Synthetic fibers with wicking capabilities
or wool, are better insulators when wet.

133
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,460
Phew.

134
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,090
This is a really long slide.

135
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,130
But only one more category to go.

136
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,730
Heat production.

137
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,010
Your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is your
lowest metabolism.

138
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,060
Essentially what it would be if you were
just lying in bed quietly.

139
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,350
It is your baseline rate and is impacted
by a variety of things like hormones, age,

140
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,800
gender, drugs, body size, and especially
muscle mass, as we discussed earlier.

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,030
Your BMR and any activity you do
determines the inside of

142
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,160
the heat balance equation when you in,
when you are in a cold environment.

143
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,120
We will talk about heat coming from the
environment in the heat section later

144
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,640
in the class.

145
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,720
Okay, so all of these static factors will
combine to determine whether or

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,760
not you become hypothermic when exposed to
the cold.

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,020
But your body is not going to just give
into those determinants without

148
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,580
a good fight.

149
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,580
It is going to do what it can to help you
stay warm regardless of

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,910
the outside conditions and your body
characteristics.

151
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,000
We saw some of the acute responses in
Corey's video.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,210
First on the list is shivering.

153
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,590
Shivering contracts agonist and
antagonistic muscle groups simultaneously,

154
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,348
thus producing small contractions that
generate heat, but little movement.

155
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,440
In contrast, non-shivering thermogenesis,

156
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,589
next on the list, can't be seen, but still
generates heat.

157
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,210
With some of your cells, there are ways to
decrease how efficiently you

158
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,090
use oxygen and fuels to produce energy, a
process called oxidative phosphorylation.

159
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,990
We'll talk about this in more detail
later, but basically uncoupling in

160
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,460
the process is like revving your engine at
a red light with the clutch in.

161
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,770
You're using fuel, producing heat but no
forward movement is taking place.

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
Another way your body keeps itself warm is
by vasoconstricting the vessels to your

163
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,900
skin and the periphery.

164
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,940
The result is that warm blood from the
core of your body stays more in the core.

165
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,450
Therefore, you lose less heat to the
surface of your body and

166
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,540
the surrounding environment.

167
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,650
The signal to constrict is mediated
through the sympathetic nervous system,

168
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,800
local signals, and circulating hormones.

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,910
And finally we have piloerection on the
list.

170
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,270
A funny word, but essentially it just
means goosebumps.

171
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,940
In the video, Corey made a joke about his
mass of chest hair keeping him warm.

172
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,690
That's because goosebumps used to be more
effective when we were hairier, so

173
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,020
that raising each hair follicle would form
an insulating layer under

174
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,580
which warm air could be trapped.

175
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,860
A built-in fur coat, as it were.

176
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,989
Now, with less hair, it is less effective,
but still a common response.

177
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,230
Overall, controlled body temperature in
the cold falls to the region of

178
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,430
the brain called the posterior
hypothalamus.

179
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,360
Many signals from different parts of your
body are all integrated there to create

180
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,750
a comprehensive management plan for your
body's derma regulation.

181
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,990
Your body has a certain order in which it
tries to keep you warm.

182
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,310
It doesn't all happen simultaneously.

183
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,670
To my right are a couple of blank graphs.

184
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,680
In the upper one, we're going to diagram a
typical pattern of heat production on

185
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,980
the vertical axis, versus outside or skin
temperature on the horizontal axis.

186
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,960
In the bottom one,

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,750
we will plot core temperature across the
same range as skin temperatures.

188
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,740
Basal metabolic rate lays the foundation
of heat production.

189
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,190
Around the thermoneutral zone,

190
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,230
where you are most comfortable, your body
manipulates blood throw,

191
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,200
blood flow through the vessels to regulate
temperature.

192
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,920
On the low end, say around 20 degrees
Celsius,

193
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,260
your peripheral vessels will be maximally
constricted.

194
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,780
On the high end, above 37 degrees, you'll
be maximally dilated to allow for

195
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,560
excess heat loss.

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,290
Above that you will also start sweating.

197
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,020
But we'll talk about more, talk about that
more in the heat section.

198
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,730
If you have already maximally constricted
down and you're still getting cold,

199
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,320
your body will start to compensate through
shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis.

200
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,790
Combined, those two mechanisms can
increase your metabolic rate four to

201
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,400
five times.

202
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,610
The leaner someone is, the more they will
need to shiver for

203
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,030
a given ambient temperature.

204
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,590
So there are ranges where your body
focuses on different strategies.

205
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,610
First it will use the less energetically
costly mechanism of vasoconstriction.

206
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,550
And then it will increase metabolic rate.

207
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,520
Evolutionarily speaking, it's kind of a
risky behavior to shiver.

208
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,840
As you have probably experienced, it is
harder to do activities of daily living,

209
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,170
like tying your shoes, throwing a ball, or

210
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,600
hiding from a sabertooth tiger when you
are shaking.

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,710
It also could waste valuable energy that
you might need later,

212
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,780
if you don't have much luck in the hunt.

213
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,850
In our case, the hunt may consist of
finding the nearest 7-11,

214
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,510
but in earlier times, it was for actual
living food.

215
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,000
The bottom graph indicates that we are
pretty good at regulating our

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
core temperature over a wide range.

217
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,960
There was a gradual fall in the middle,
with sharper rises and

218
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,350
declines on the two ends.

219
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,880
That's it for Module 2.

220
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
At the end of this module and

221
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,020
most others, you will find some Check for
Understanding questions.

222
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,050
Please answer them when they are available
before moving onto the next modules.

223
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,290
Next up, Module 3, Corey's Data.

224
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,550
You should have enough information now to
answer some of those questions we left you

225
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,280
with at the end of the Corey Gets Cold
video.

226
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,780
Thank you.
