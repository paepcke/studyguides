1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,764
[SOUND]

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:11,510
>> Where’s Corey now?

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,750
Surprise.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,190
We’re on the top of a mountain in
Colorado.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,290
Pikes Peak in Colorodo Springs, 14,000
feet.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,370
And this is a continuation of our high
altitude module.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,440
So we were in Usariem in Natick,
Massachussets for the acute exposure, and

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,120
now we've come more than 4,000 feet
higher, up to the top of Pike's Peak, and

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,420
we're going to do another max test and see
how his altitude performance is impacted.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,300
And we're also going to have a little bit
of chronic exposure in this module.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,080
So, we're going to stay up here and

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,740
see how it feels to live at this elevation
for at least 48 hours.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,130
A lot of the adaptations that occur in the
body in response to altitude take place in

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,450
that first 48 hours, because we're in this
incredibly stressful environment and

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,394
our body is just screaming out for some
kind of oxygen [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]

16
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:07,900
[INAUDIBLE] and it's impacting our brain,
and we can't think of the right words.

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,180
And so it's, we're trying to acclimatize
very rapidly here, because the oxygen's so

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,790
low in our blood and we want to get it
back up as soon as possible.

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,160
How are you feeling about this, Cory?

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,050
>> I'm feeling a little bit less nervous
than I was on the car drive up here.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,700
And we're starting to pass a little gas as
through.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,840
>> [LAUGH] Shh, it was a secret.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,380
>> cameraman, I'm feeling a little bit
light headed.

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,640
But not much so I,

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,460
I'm feeling a little bit more optimistic
about how painful this is going to be.

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,520
>> I'm feeling a little delirious, and I'm
supposed to be the altitude person.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,400
So, maybe, kind of funny because I could
just crash and

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,730
burn in the next 48 hours, and Corey could
just come out smelling like roses.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,276
[CROSSTALK]

30
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,838
>> Hopefully we'll be able to get all the
footage we need for this episode or

31
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:51,320
else, well now, we'd be, come up here for
absolutely nothing.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,890
>> Here we are, the moment that we've been
waiting for.

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,820
We're up in the Azarian research station
at 14,000 feet for Cory's max text.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,950
And we're here with Chuck and

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,750
Katelyn who'll be running the test, just
like they did in the chamber.

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,980
And we're expecting some good things out
of our decathlete Cory, but

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,080
we're not sure how he's going to hold up
under these low oxygen pressures.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,410
>> Now, what I want you to do is put that
in like a snorkel.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,310
And those clip on.

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:24,290
We want to start you at 3% grade and three
miles an hour.

41
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,050
Rory, right at the moment, your heart
rate's 114.

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,940
86 saturation.

43
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,950
Cory, in 15 seconds, we're going to go
four miles an hour.

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,840
The grade'll stay the same.

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,666
Four miles an hour, 3% grade.

46
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,300
>> Feel it?

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,890
You're doing great.

48
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,905
>> The saturation is down to 78%.

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,090
Okay Cory, 10 seconds I'm going to bring
it up to 7% grade.

51
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,410
>> Up you go.

52
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,950
Looking good.

53
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,030
>> Alright Cory.

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,900
151 heart rate.

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,310
If we can get a an RPE please?

56
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,406
>> 15.

57
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,990
>> 15.

58
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,870
But I'm going to increase the speed.

59
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,000
Get you running.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,650
Six miles an hour, okay?

61
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,100
Run whenever you feel like you need to.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,792
There you go.

63
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,092
Okay.

64
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:28,260
[NOISE]

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,250
Heart rate's up to 169.

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,033
Saturation is 73.

67
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,940
>> Hang in there, Cory.

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,880
Looking good.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,660
>> Cory, I know you got a long way to go
yet, but

70
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,150
when you feel like you've only got a
minute to go, just put up a finger, okay?

71
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,200
Let us know.

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,700
Okay.

73
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,290
Heart rate's 177.

74
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,970
mLs per kg is 35.

75
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,080
Looking good, Cory, keep it going.

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,940
>> Great Cory, stay up, stay up on the
treadmill.

77
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,540
>> 189 hot, that's it.

78
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,670
Grab the, grab the rails.

79
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,340
>> Grab the rails.

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,070
>> Grab the rails.

81
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,760
>> Grab the rails.
>> Okay, let's cool him down.

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,620
>> You feeling okay?

83
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,278
>> So, is it common for test subjects to
vomit [INAUDIBLE]

84
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,625
>> It happens.

85
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,620
Been known to happen, it's been known to
happen in dramatic fashion,

86
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,530
like the time I was doing

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,678
>> [NOISE]

88
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,725
>> [LAUGH]
>> Oh, Jesus.

89
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,035
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> You made about ten hot spots.

90
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:36,980
>> [LAUGH] I was just going to say, I was
doing a max test, and one of my subjects

91
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,300
threw up into an industrial-sized fan,
which blew it back against the wall.

92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,970
>> Nice.
>> Into like a,

93
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,330
a police outline on the wall.

94
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,110
Oh, it was nasty.

95
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,380
Yeah, it was a $6,000 hurl, because it
broke the bike,

96
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,730
because the hydrochloric acid got on,
underneath the bike.

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,640
>> We just stood right behind you, but you
were, you were shifting your gait.

98
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,565
>> Forward, back, sideways.

99
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:58,780
>> [LAUGH] You were like a ping pong ball,
just going back and forth.

100
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,330
And at that point, you know.

101
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,870
>> Yeah, I do.

102
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,650
>> Called in to read.

103
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,580
>> We did, we just, I'm just kind of like,
okay six foot one guy falling on me.

104
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,098
>> What I did feel is a real,

105
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,850
like the head the lightheadedness that we
felt when we got out of the car.

106
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,420
>> Yeah.

107
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,340
>> I felt that, just, you know,
steamrolled, just really exacerbate.

108
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,170
>> Part of altitude mountain sickness,
especially when they become hypoxic,

109
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,385
there's that sense, one of euphoria, two,
that you're invincible.

110
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,280
>> Yeah.
>> But you're going off down the deep end

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,420
down a very different path.

112
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,570
>> But as many people know It's like, you
know.

113
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,010
because a lot of folks, livin' in the
mountains, and they say, well,

114
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,324
let's just go off on a long hike, let's
go,

115
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:38,150
let's go climb that 14-er, without really
knowing what it's going to do to them.

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,985
By doing these kinds of things, allowing
people to,

117
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,076
to know
>> Yeah.

118
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,114
>> Exactly what to expect.

119
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:43,881
Already important.

120
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,950
Very important.

121
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,917
[LAUGH]

122
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,790
>> So, Chuck, you have people that look
like they're working pretty hard for you.

123
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,013
>> They're working very hard.

124
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,112
>> Trying to test with this particular
procedure.

125
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:57,090
>> Well, we, we did this test at sea
level, and

126
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,580
what they're doing right now is, they're
carrying 35 pound packs.

127
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,740
And, they're going to go as fast as they
possibly can for five miles.

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,770
I realize now that, they don't look like
they're going very fast.

129
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,733
But remember, we're at 14,000 feet.

130
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,802
Very, very difficult.

131
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:15,456
When we take folks who are not carrying
packs, from sea level directly up to

132
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:19,940
14,000, like these folks have done, it's
not unusual to find 50% decrements.

133
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,270
It takes about 50% longer to, to do the
five miles.

134
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,650
So this is exactly what we want to do, to
find what that decrement is, so

135
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,270
that we can use that information and give
it to commanders in the field so

136
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,055
they can better plan, assaults, and, and
so forth.

137
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:45,200
[SOUND]

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,070
>> Little hard to build stuff [INAUDIBLE].

139
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,780
>> [LAUGH]
>> Last night was our first full night on

140
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,100
the peak, and, for me, I think, without a
doubt, it was one of my lowest moments,

141
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,249
if not the lowest moment I've had, during
this entire video series.

142
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,360
We really struggled last night.

143
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,700
We really felt pretty bad.

144
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,460
Pretty big headache, lot of rolling around
in the bed, not much sleep.

145
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,932
Think I got up four times to go to the
bathroom during the middle of the night.

146
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:20,295
[LAUGH] Which wasn't so funny then but
it's kind of funny now.

147
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:25,590
[LAUGH] Feeling a little bit better, as
the day goes on.

148
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,230
But, I didn't quite see last night coming.

149
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,870
It was a lot more painful than I thought
it would be.

150
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,150
We've, we've done some things that have
been some, like,

151
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,710
painful in the short term, and I'm used to
that with training and exercise.

152
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:43,750
But that was, the long stint of 12 hours
of night time sort of low grade misery.

153
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,840
And I don't expect it to get any worse
than that.

154
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,990
>> We had a little bit of a rough what
night last night.

155
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,070
Wasn't sleeping too soundly, had quite a
headache.

156
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,980
We did no climatization while we were
preparing for this trip.

157
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,130
We wanted to sort of see what the acute
effects would be at 14,000 feet.

158
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,160
But I have to say that I'm feeling pretty
good now, because I'm out of the building,

159
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,040
my headache's gone, I've had some food.

160
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,030
So, the good news is that climatization
does happen pretty rapidly,

161
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,625
your body adjusts to all these stresses
that are put upon it.

162

you've changed at all.

I can, I can tell just by looking at you,
you look a lot better.

165
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,920
Not as hypoxic.

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,610
You have a little bit more color than you
did last week.

167
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,520
But let's see let's see what your maximal
performance is.

168
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,299
Okay, Cory, I'm going to start you at
three miles an hour.

169
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,360
Okay, just to give you a little bit of a
warm-up, just like we did last time.

170
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,990
Cory, everything's looking great.

171
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,360
Right on schedule.

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,230
Saturations are a tad bit higher this
time, and

173
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,690
heart rate seems to be a little bit lower.

174
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,600
So you're, seems to be acclimatizing quite
well.

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,900
Okay, if we can get our ratings, please.

176
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,180
Stronger steps this time,

177
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,380
it seems to me, not, not wavering as much
as did the first day.

178
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay, Cory.

179
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,170
Next one, Cory, we're going to start
running.

180
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,624
Start running when it feels comfortable.

181
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,520
>> Good Cory.

182
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,690
>> Need another ratings, please.

183
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,580
Saturation is seven, eight, 78.

184
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,569
Speed, we'll say it's six.

185
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,704
We're going to go up to 3%.

186
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,780
We'll stay at six miles an hour, but we're
going to to a 5% grade.

187
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,820
Keep pushing it, Cory.

188
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,380
>> You're doing great, Cory.

189
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,230
>> Looking great.

190
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,520
>> Stay, stay on the treadmill.

191
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,340
>> 'Kay, and now the ratings please.

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,290
>> 'Kay.

193
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,880
Hang in there.

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,582
Keep pushing.
>> Keep going Cory.

195
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,060
>> Doing great.
>> Saturation is 76.

196
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,686
Stay in the middle, come on Cory.

197
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:54,150
Gimme some more, gimme some more, c'mon
gimme.

198
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,382
No don't, don't hold him, don't touch him.

199
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,940
Keep it, keep it going, keep it going,
come on.

200
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,550
Keep it going, come on.

201
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,226
That's it, that's it, that's it.

202
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:07,696
Come on Cory.

203
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:18,778
Well, Dr. Freelander, I'm

204
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:24,478
going to let you have his results and,

205
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:29,040
have you explain it to Cory.

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
>> I saw the numbers on the screen.

207
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,640
Dang.

208
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,330
I'm surprised.

209
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,814
I really thought I would get better.

210
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,318
>> Self-contained meal.

211
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:50,470
Everything he needs.
>> [FOREIGN] The heating pouch.

212
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,110
Tear here.

213
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,840
Fancy pouch is going to heat up my meal
for me.

214
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,500
Put a little on both sides.

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,580
>> So the heat is on either side of the
food now.

216
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,034
Heat it up.
It gets quite hot.

217
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,996
>> Mm, good.

218
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,035
>> Wow, you are constipated.

219
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:14,390
Those are hard stools.

220
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,390
>> The moment I got out of the car,
everything changed.

221
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,820
First of all, I immediately had to go the
bathroom.

222
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,140
Apparently, you have to urinate because
you're evacuating the plasma to

223
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,500
get a higher blood cell concentration.

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,660
>> Look at your hands.

225
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,420
>> Huh?
>> Look how white your hands are.

226
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,970
>> Are they white?

227
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,460
>> It sounds very hollow in here.

228
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,114
There's an echo going on.

231
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,317
Don't run Carlos over now.

232
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,126
>> Oh, my leg's breaking!
