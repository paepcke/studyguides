1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,250
Today we're going to look at applications
of well, geometric problems.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,720
And again, some of these are very, very
simple, and so, we actually skip them.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,500
Things like computing projections of, of a
point onto a convex set.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,440
Doing things like, calculating distance
between two convex sets,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,270
these are just too simple, to even
mention.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,320
So we're going to skip those,

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,770
although they're [NOISE] they're kind of
obvious, by now.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,100
know, an example of that would be,

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,760
how do you compute the distance between
two polyhedra, right?

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,790
So, without even writing it down, you
should know by now, that's just a QP.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,890
You know, you minimize norm x minus y, to
norm subject to,

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,140
you know, ax less than b, and fz less than
g.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,570
Okay, so we don't cover that kind of
stuff, because it's too simple.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,980
Instead, we're going to focus on stuff
that's less obvious.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,670
And really I mean quite interesting and
very useful.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,010
So the first topic is going to be the
Lowner-John ellipsoid.

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,600
And this, this is not obvious, although
these things have been known for

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,810
about a 100 years, although not, nothing
was about it, computationally.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,400
Right, this was not an algorithmic thing,

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,570
this was just theory, until maybe, 20
years ago.

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,240
So, basic idea is, you want to compute the
minimum volume ellipsoid that

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,550
covers a set, and it's completely general.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,200
So, I have a set c, and what I'm going to
do,

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,400
is compute the minimum volume ellipsoid
that covers it, so that, that's the idea.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,990
By the way, there's tons of applications
of this, right?

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,640
One would be, to give a, c could be very
large, very complex and

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,960
instead, all you want, is sort of a
summary of c, that is, is smaller, right?

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,370
And so, to describe, an ellipsoid takes on
the order of n squared,

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,770
in fact n squared over 2, parameters to
describe an ellipsoid, in Rn.

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,620
So that's sort of, a compact, way to do
this.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,520
And this approximation, covering a bunch
of,

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,440
when you're covering a bunch of points,
it's a conservative one.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,059
I guess, so you'd say, that you're
going to cover more, than just the points.

34
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,370
Alright.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,590
Now, generically, you can solve this
problem.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,710
I should be more careful about it.

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,900
We can generically write this, as a convex
optimization problem.

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,650
So, computing the minimum volume
ellipsoid.

39
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,070
But there's going to be an expression that
comes up in the constraints,

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,380
that may be handle, depends on that being
tractable,

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,300
before this becomes a tractable convex
program, right?

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,210
Oh, and I guess, we've we're far enough
along in the class, that it's time for

43
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,820
you to do, we, we can actually be more
honest here and admit things like,

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,790
they're non-tractable convex optimization
problems, this is kind of obvious right?

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,020
Because of [INAUDIBLE] convex optimization
problem, but for

46
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,480
example, to evaluate the objective or a
constrain function,

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,400
is itself intractable, then you're in
trouble, right?

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
So, okay.

49
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,400
So what we'll do, is we'll, this is very
carefully chosen parameterization of

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,130
the ellipsoid, and we're going to write it
as this.

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,390
It's the inverse image of the unit ball,
under an affine mapping, right?

52
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,210
So, so, we're going to take the ellipsoid
e,

53
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,700
to be the set of points, for which the two
norm of av plus b, is less than 1, right?

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,720
So, that's the inverse image of the unit
ball,

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
under the affine mapping, av plus b, okay?

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,330
Now here, a here of course, a could be
anything.

57
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,878
I mean, well it has to be square, but it
wouldn't even have to be square.

58
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,222
But we can, without loss of generality,
we're going to take,

59
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:27,690
we're going to take a, to be symmetric
positive definite, okay?

60
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,930
Now the argument there, I'm just going to
go over it very briefly here,

61
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,760
so this is going to be a little bit
obscure, but hope you can follow up.

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,730
The argument is this.

63
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,772
here, I can multiply a and b,

64
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:45,680
on the left, by any orthogonal matrix, and
it will define the same ellipsoid.

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
Everyone agree with that,

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,730
because it doesn't change, it doesn't
change the norm.

67
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,000
But if that's the case, I can take an
arbitrary non-singular matrix,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,550
multiply on the left, by an appropriate
orthogonal matrix, and

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,480
make it symmetrically positive definite,
right?

70
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,620
And the way you do that, again, I'll just
talk through it because it's,

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,780
I don't know, we're far enough along, that
we can do this, we can, go faster.

72
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,700
You just take this singular value
decomposition of a.

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,185
So, you have u sigma v transpose, and you
multiply on the left, by like you know,

74
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:17,175
v u transpose, and that's an orthogonal
matrix, and

75
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,250
it converts into symmetric positive
definite, okay?

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
So that's the idea.

77
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,010
Now the volume of this ellipsoid,

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,120
is proportional to the determinant of a
inverse.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,220
In fact the, the pro, the constant
inproportionality,

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,100
is exactly the volume of the unit ball, in
rn, right?

81
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,060
Which, which actually doesn't,

82
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,290
if we're minimizing, it hardly matters
what that is.

83
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,280
It's something, it's got some pi's in it,
and some gamma functions, or

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,815
factorials and things like that, but it
doesn't really matter.

85
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:49,590
It's, so, it's proportional to the
determinant of A inverse, right?

86
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,680
Because when you, when things map under
affine mappings, or

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,510
linear mapping, affine mappings, volumes
transforms like determinants, okay?

88
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,070
So, alright, so now our problem looks like
this.

89
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,040
It says, minimize over variables, a and b.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,990
Log det A inverse, right?

91
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,430
So that's the log of the volume, well, up
to a constant, right,

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,570
because it's an additive thing.

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,390
Subject to the condition, that every point
c, is in this set, and one way to say that

94
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,160
is that, for every point in c, the norm of
ab plus b, is less than 1, right so.

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,590
And you could write this, this way or

96
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,140
you could write it as, I could remove the
soup and say, for all vnc, okay?

97
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,750
And that would be the, the condition,
right?

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,184
So, that's the, that's the condition.

99
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:41,080
You might ask, why does it say in
parentheses here, over here ab?

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,820
Because these, well,

101
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,070
this kind of problem generically, ends up
with maximally confusing notation.

102
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,470
And then of course, norm, norm of linear
is convex, and this is true for any v.

103
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,450
So supremum, that's point y supremum,
that's convex.

104
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,920
So, okay, so here, that's a convex
optimization problem and

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,938
it computes the minimum volume ellipsoid,
that covers this at c.

106
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,895
Now, the question's whether it's tractable
or not, and

107
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:17,120
it's tractable precisely when this
constraint is handleable, right?

108
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:21,492
so, here's a simple case where it is,
there's actually a whole bunch,

109
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:25,288
where it is, I mean, not a whole bunch,
but there's, there's, there's a bunch of

110
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:29,010
cases where it tractable but here's one
where it is, lets look at this.

111
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,648
Let, let's take c to be a finite set.

112
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,560
So, I have a cloud of points, and

113
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,450
I want to compute the minimum volume
ellipsoid that covers it, right?

114
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,280
So that's the, that's the idea.

115
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,970
So here, well that's very simple because
it's the supreme, sup, v and

116
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,975
c is nothing but

117
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:48,140
a, that requires that each, each of these
points is in the set and so, you get this.

118
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,350
And of course, that's the Lowner-John
ellipsoid for

119
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,600
a polyhedron, described by its, its
verticies, right?

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,710
So what that says is, if I give you a
bunch of points, like this, and

121
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,280
then you calculate, then, then you take
the convex hull, right?

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,710
Then computing the minimum volume
ellipsoid that covers that

123
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,154
is an entirely tractable convex problem,
okay?

124
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:16,000
So by the way these things are, are not
obvious here.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,620
So for example if I, I could give you an
ellipsoid, described as, sorry,

126
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,980
a polyhedron described as the convex hull
of a set of points.

127
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,623
And so, that can give you vertices, and

128
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:30,250
I could ask, find me the maximum volume
ellipsoid, that lies inside it.

129
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,560
That's, that's another natural problem,

130
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,420
that we'll look at shortly, that's
actually NP-hard, okay?

131
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,070
So, so these things are, I mean,

132
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,090
you really have to be very careful with
these things, right?

133
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,860
It depends on the description and it
depends you know,

134
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,640
whether it's extremely easy or extremely
hard, depends on the description.

135
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,778
Okay, so that's the Lowner–John ellipsoid.

136
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:57,640
well, the dual, roughly, of that, is the
maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid.

137
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,750
So, here, we have, this time, the set has
to be convex.

138
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,250
I mean, it doesn't have to be convex, but

139
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,040
then, it's actually quite intractable,
right?

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,730
So we take, a convex set, and then the
idea is,

141
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,780
we want to find the maximum volume
ellipsoid, that sits inside it, okay?

142
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,810
And, we do that this way.

143
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,710
This time, we're going to parameterize the
ellipsoid, as the forward image,

144
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,390
as opposed to the inverse image of the
unit vol, under an affine mapping.

145
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,390
So here, it's the set of points bu plus d,
where u is in a unit vol, right?

146
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,090
So, by the way, there are lots of
different parameterizations of ellipsoids,

147
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,500
as general linear algebra,

148
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
that would go between the different
canonical representations, right?

149
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
It'd be elementary linear algebra like you
know,

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,448
square roots of matrices, things like
that.

151
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:54,500
What's interesting, is they all have
different convexity properties, right?

152
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,370
So, a problem would be convex in one, but
not the other.

153
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,965
So whenever you have problems in,

154
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,460
when you optimize over ellipsoids, they're
actually kind of fun.

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Because it's not, it's not like a problem,

156
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,880
where something's just just given to you
on a platter.

157
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,360
You have to figure out the appropriate
representation, to make it convex, if,

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,100
if, if it's even, if that even exists,
right?

159
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,090
So, okay, so here's the forward image, and
in this case,

160
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,880
the volume is proportional to the
determinant.

161
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,610
We want to maximize it, so we maximize log
log determinant, right,

162
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,400
which you recognize as tractable, because
log determinant is concave.

163
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,370
And here, the condition is this this
condition right here,

164
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,930
is simply this, right?

165
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,730
So that's the, that, this condition here,

166
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,760
says that if you take the unit ball and

167
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,550
you multiply b by it, add d, that this set
lies entirely in c.

168
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,130
So that looks like this, right?

169
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,430
I mean, this is just a long and
complicated way to say that, for

170
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,380
all u of norm less than 1, bu plus d, is
in c, right?

171
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,770
I guess this is, it's written this way, so

172
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,360
that we can verify instantly, that this is
convex, right?

173
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,769
And the way to do that, is very simple.

174
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,580
This thing, that expression, is linear in
the variables, which are b and d.

175
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,340
ic, that's the indicator function, that's,
of course, convex, so that's convex.

176
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,250
So for each u, this is convex, that's a
supremum of convex functions, so

177
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,160
that means that the left-hand side is
convex, so you have a convex inequality.

178
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,980
Okay, so, once again, the issue is the
following.

179
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:42,260
Is this, is evaluating that function,
tractable, right?

180
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,120
And there's very simple cases, where it's
not.

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Here's one, if I simply give you a finite
number of points, and

182
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,430
I ask you, does that hold there, that's
actually, that, that,

183
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,270
that one is actually going to be np hard,
right?

184
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,740
Not, not a finite number point, sorry.

185
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,400
The convex hull, of a finite number of
points, that's actually np hard.

186
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,210
Right?
So so it's sometimes tractable,

187
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,260
sometimes it's not.

188
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,970
But here and there's a kind of, a
pre-duality here.

189
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,410
What's interesting is, it turns out,

190
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,680
remember that computing the minimum volume
ellipsoid [COUGH] is tractable.

191
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
The canonical case is, when you give the
vertices.

192
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,512
So, computing the maximum volume ellipsoid
is tractable and again,

193
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:27,140
almost, aesthetics almost requires this
right,

194
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,790
because just to make it pretty it's the
dual representation of ellipse,

195
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,860
of a polyhedron, which is in fact, given
by its linear inequalities, right?

196
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,049
So, so what happens is here, if I give you
polyhedron defined by linear inequalities,

197
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,483
then, this is really simple because
basically you're asking, when is it true,

198
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:52,100
that ai transpose times bu plus d,

199
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,410
is less than bi for all u, less than one,
right?

200
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,850
That's the question.

201
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,690
What are the conditions on b and d, under
which this holds, right?

202
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,830
And this is actually, relatively easy to
work out, right?

203
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,710
So you have, ai transpose d, that comes
out fine, and then here,

204
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,110
you need to calculate, you know, what's
the largest possible value of that?

205
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,670
Well, that's easy, that's the converse
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, right?

206
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,280
Because it says, you have a, you have
something, which is b a i, and then

207
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,140
you take an inner product of b a i with a
vector u, whose norm is less than one.

208
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,950
And you want to know the maximum value of
that, and

209
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,110
the answer is, the norm of b a i, alright?

210
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,760
That's Cauchy- Schwartz or the converse of
Cauchy-Schwartz, okay?

211
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,320
So, this problem translates to this, that
is again,

212
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,880
you have to be on your toes here, because
of the variables are b and

213
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,930
d, which, which parameterize the ellipsoid
here.

214
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,370
And that, otherwise these are just
completely legitimate constraints,

215
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,480
that's a clearly a concave function, that
you're maximizing.

216
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,710
And the inequality here, again, with band
d,

217
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,740
that's a linear term, here, that's linear
in b, right?

218
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,730
And so that norm term, so these are
second-order constraints.

219
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,030
So, there's actually some very interesting
things you can show,

220
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,260
about these ellipsoidal approximations.

221
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,870
So let's take a convex, you know, bounded
non-empty interior set and,

222
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,610
it's the following, that there's actually
this basic efficiency.

223
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,040
It says that, if you take a set, so

224
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,340
here's one, here's a polyhedron, given by
its vertices.

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,940
This is the Lowner-John ellipsoid the
minimum volume ellipsoid that covers it.

226
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,530
It, it says that if you take that
Lowner-John Ellipsoid and

227
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,460
you shrink it by a factor of n, that's the
space dimension, right about its center.

228
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,294
That's guaranteed to be inside the set,
okay?

229
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:46,640
Everybody, got that?

230
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,860
And so, actually what that says is that,
you can, I'm going to say it something

231
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,870
like this, it says that, any convex set in
rn, can be approximated, within a factor.

232
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,200
In fact, here, I'll even try it this way.

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,270
Within a, it can be approximated within a
factor of square root n, by an ellipsoid.

234
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,950
Everybody got that?

235
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,760
Now, I mean, you might not like the factor
square root n, but

236
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,830
the point is, that's what says.

237
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,580
Everybody, and by the way, that statement
is completely false.

238
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,410
I mean, you can talk about things like,
with other, with other classes of

239
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,430
geometric objects, right you could talk
about things, like a bounding box, right?

240
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,701
And it's just completely false, right?

241
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:29,420
All sorts of things you might imagine,
things, data structures to

242
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,730
describe regions in rn, and it's just not,
not the case.

243
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,740
I mean, there are others, right?

244
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,820
One would be like, a simplex, right so
that's another one.

245
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,920
Now, by the way, in this example, you can
see that that factor of two,

246
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,550
I mean this is in space dimension two,
right?

247
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,430
In here, you can see, the factor of two
was not needed.

248
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,580
It's quite likely, I mean in this case,
take a look at it.

249
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,420
Here, I mean, we can eyeball it, okay?

250
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,720
Probably, you didn't have to divide by
factor of two, but

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
by, you just divide it by 20-30%, and
you're inside, okay?

252
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,830
And by the way, that factor is an
interesting number, you might call that,

253
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:09,030
you know, how ellipsoidally approximable,
this set is or something, I don't know.

254
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,736
So, everybody see what I'm saying here?

255
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,480
So here, it just guarantees, by the way,

256
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,340
what's the worst possible set to
approximate, by an ellipsoid?

257
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,935
What is the convex set, that is the worst
possible one?

258
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,990
Simplex, there we go.

259
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,580
Okay, so let's do triangle, like this.

260
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,050
You know, there's your minimum volume
ellipsoid's, a circle.

261
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,770
There's, there it is, and in this case,
guess what?

262
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,180
You have to shrink it exactly by a factor
of n, before it fits inside, and

263
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,675
that tells you, that this factor of n
cannot be improved, okay?

264
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:50,350
So the least ellipsoidally approximable
convex set, is a simplex.

265
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,010
I've drawn it this way, but in fact, all
of these ellipsoid approximation methods,

266
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,570
they're actually invariant under affine
transformations, right?

267
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,430
Because if I take a set if I multiply it,
you know,

268
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,720
if I apply an affine transformation,
what'll happen is, volume transforms under

269
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,310
affine transformation, just by a
determinant, by a constant.

270
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,040
So, you get a commutative diagram.

271
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,890
In other words, if you take the original
set affine transformation,

272
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,930
optimal ellipsoid, then apply an affine
transformation of the optimal ellipsoid,

273
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,470
you get the optimal ellipsoid for the
second case.

274
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,090
You get a commutative diagram, okay?

275
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,410
So it's, in other words, you might say
something like this.

276
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,830
Extremal volume ellipsoidal approximation,
is affinely invariant.

277
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,880
Everybody got that?

278
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,570
That's actually quite important actually
it's quite important in practice, right,

279
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,080
because it says that, if the Xs represent
things and,

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,140
you actually don't have any idea how this
scale should go together.

281
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,390
I mean if, if it means nothing to you,
then there are plenty of cases like that,

282
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,110
then it says you'd, I mean you should
probably whatever your method is,

283
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,690
should be affinely variant.

284
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,240
So, oh I should say something like this,

285
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,890
if the, if the polyhedron is, is
symmetric.

286
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,810
Symmetric means, if x is in the set, so is
minus x, right?

287
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,370
So an example would be, a norm ball.

288
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,830
Then it says, you can, this factor is not
n, but square root n, okay?

289
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,760
And I said something obscure at first.

290
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,510
I said, any convex set can be approximated
by an ellipsoid,

291
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,080
within a factor square root n, right?

292
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,800
And so, let me explain what I was saying.

293
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,420
That's kind of I, I, I, I take the minimum
volume one and

294
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,180
I divide by square root n, right?

295
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,520
So, I put the one that's geometrically in
the middle.

296
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,450
And what that means is, for any convex
set,

297
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,630
I can produce a convex set which has the
property that if I expand it,

298
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,110
square root n, I cover, and if I shrink
it, square root n, I'm inside, okay?

299
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,150
So, actually, philosophically, it's quite
interesting.

300
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,910
It's that, you could, you can argue
something like this.

301
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,370
Ellipsoids are universal approximators of
convex sets, yeah?

302
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,180
I mean, square root n, is not a fantastic.

303
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,480
By the way, it's the fourth root of m, for
sym-, symmetric, right?

304
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,640
You know, you might not like that.

305
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,060
But the point is, it's a constant, right?

306
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,950
And, and that, that's it.

307
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,070
I mean, its even a constant that doesn't
grow that badly, and

308
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,840
all that kind of stuff.

309
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,400
And so, so this is kind of interesting,
and it kind of explains a lot about,

310
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,050
how, why things like quadratic methods,
would be so prevalent.

311
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,770
By the way, one, one interesting think you
can say here, is the following.

312
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,170
Any norm on rn, can be approximated by a
quadratic norm,

313
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,340
within a factor of N to the 1 4th, okay?

314
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,300
And that's interesting right, because it
says that, anything, any,

315
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,320
any norm and there are some very
sophisticated norms, right?

316
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,750
It's as if, every single one is
approximately with,

317
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,370
within, into the 1 4th, by a quadratic
one, right?

318
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,790
So that tells you actually, I think it, to
me, this is sort of a philosophical,

319
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,250
this explains why least square, why using
least squares for

320
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,910
the last two centuries, people have gotten
pretty far, right?

321
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,714
This this at least explains it, right?

322
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:10,290
[BLANK_AUDIO]

323
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,720
Next topic is Centering.

324
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,172
So I mean, and here is tons and tons of
applications of centering.

325
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:20,380
I'll just address that first you've seen a
couple already,

326
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,140
even in the first couple of weeks.

327
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,420
We saw yield maximization, so yield
maximization says,

328
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,280
that you're running a manufacturing
process, you want to tell your machine,

329
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,740
to target a certain set of like, critical
dimensions, let's say an IC manufacturer.

330
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,690
But since you're pushing it, right, you're
pushing it absolutely to the limited

331
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,650
technology, when you say, please make this
critical dimension one nanometer.

332
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,980
it's act-, it's going to be off, a little
bit and things like that, so

333
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,250
there's variations.

334
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,900
And so, there you have a, a polyhedron
that describes the acceptable,

335
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,150
acceptable critical pairs you know,
combinations are critical dimensions.

336
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,790
Now, what you want is, you want to tell
them, you want to,

337
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,980
the target you want to shoot for, is
something deep in, deep in that set.

338
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,100
So, that when you have variations away
from it you're still in it,

339
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,770
your yield is high, okay?

340
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,710
So, we, we looked at all that.

341
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,040
So, so, that comes up and we've even seen
some of these problems.

342
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,800
So, here's one, find the center of the
largest inscribed ball.

343
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,210
That's the Chebyshev center, and that's
this problem.

344
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,620
I give you a polyhedron described by
inequalities, and I say,

345
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,240
please find me the ball of maximum radius
that fits inside, and

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,330
the center of that, we're going to call
the Chebyshev center.

347
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,430
And it's the point deepest in the deepest
in the polyhedron, right?

348
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,851
And and that means, well it's clearly
defined, right?

349
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,740
It' it's the one which have highest depth,

350
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,370
highest distance to the exterior right,
that's this.

351
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,800
And that's an LP, that was actually one of
our first examples, when we looked at LP.

352
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,224
And it was a fun example,

353
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:57,490
because it doesn't look like it should be
an LP, right?

354
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,450
because, well it looks like an LP, while
you're drawing the polyhedron outside, but

355
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,410
the minute you draw a ball, that should,
you know,

356
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,130
that, that should not evoke LP, right?

357
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,090
But it's an LP.
Okay, a more sophisticated one,

358
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,903
is the center of the maximum volume
ellipsoid.

359
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:22,360
Actually that's quite interesting because
this one is actually,

360
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,260
invariant under affine coordinate
transformations, right?

361
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,260
Now, that may not be relevant to you,
right?

362
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,190
If, if, your coordinates are things you
know about,

363
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,880
you're intimately familiar with them, and
you really do know the range of

364
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,570
each one and they all have separate
meanings, good for you.

365
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,140
And affine invariance doesn't mean
anything, right?

366
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,460
But in a lot of, in a lot of cases, that's
just not true, right?

367
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,580
That these are, these are sort of
arbitrary coordinates,

368
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,810
these might features or

369
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,260
something like that, and you don't know
the scale or anything, right?

370
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,260
You pick a reasonable scale and that's
about all you can do.

371
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,070
Okay, so, so this is one, this is the
center of the maximum volume ellipsoid.

372
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,835
There's one,

373
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:06,270
that we are going to be looking at very
much in the next couple of weeks.

374
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,850
We'll see this, it'll take a while, but
maybe in three weeks, two and

375
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,070
a half weeks, and that's the analytic
center.

376
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,780
So, this is a good time to look at it.

377
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,150
So, the analytic sensor is actually not,
it's not a function of the set,

378
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,740
it's actually a function of the
description of the set.

379
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,810
So, technically, I don't know,

380
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,260
it's not the same as the minimum volume
ellipsoid and all that kind of stuff.

381
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,310
So, here's what it is.

382
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,380
Suppose, I have a set of convex
inequalities and equalities.

383
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,430
Then, I simply form the following problem.

384
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,910
I minimize the sum of the logs of the
minus fi's,

385
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,410
the fi's of course, minus fi, well it has
a perfect interpretation,

386
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,335
it's the margin in the affine inequality,
right?

387
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:55,410
because the, the third inequality says, f3
has to be negative, less than or

388
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,700
equal to zero, right?

389
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,303
So, if f3 is minus 2.1 you have a margin
of 2.1.

390
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:03,920
So these are the margins here, right?

391
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,940
Positive means you're in the interior of
the set,

392
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,750
well relative interior because of this,
okay?

393
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,042
So here, this is log its, its the sum of
the logs of the margins,

394
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,640
well it's the product of the margins,
right?

395
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,580
So this says, maximum the product of the
margins, that's what this is, okay?

396
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,410
And, this comes up in a lot of things.

397
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:29,012
That's a convex optimization problem of
course, right,

398
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:34,640
because minus log minus, [INAUDIBLE] is a
convex increasing function, right?

399
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,690
I mean, you know to trace through the two
minuses, to see what happens, right?

400
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,780
The first minus changes the sign,

401
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,260
the monotonicity and it changes concave to
convex.

402
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,570
And the second one chain flips the
uh,monotonicity, okay?

403
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,920
So or, makes it go back to be increasing,
right?

404
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,260
So, so the by the composition rule, this
is a convex function, here.

405
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,270
That, that, and that's called the this
function is called the log barrier, right?

406
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,630
So, it's a barrier function, right?

407
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,710
And the meaning of that is that, on this
set of points,

408
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,730
where this is strictly less than zero,
this thing's finite,

409
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,430
as you move that point towards any point,
where one of these goes to zero,

410
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,050
one of these margins goes to zero, and the
product goes to infinity, right?

411
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,960
Well, certain, the sum of the negative log
minus, negative log margins,

412
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,240
goes to infinity, right?

413
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,740
So this actually is, extremely easy to
solve.

414
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,130
I mean, it depends on the definition, it
depends how f is given, but

415
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,959
we'll see that later.

416
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,400
But it's not a property of the feasible
set, it's actually, it's,

417
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,150
it's a function of the description of the
problem, and that'll be clear in a minute.

418
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,500
But, for fun, let's just look at the
analytic center,

419
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,790
of a set of linear inequalities.

420
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,620
So, here's a set of linear inequalities
like this, and what's plotted here,

421
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,030
are various things.

422
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:58,170
These dash curves show the level sets of
the log, this is the log barrier.

423
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,770
And what's, what are showing here, are the
level sets of the log barrier, right?

424
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,980
So, actually if you say, what's the level
sets?

425
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,850
Wh, where are they equal?

426
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,598
Whe, where's it equal to 1000?

427
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:14,140
You get, a kind of a cool little, you know
curve, a smooth curve here,

428
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,450
which hugs the boundary of this thing,
very closely, right?

429
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,510
And then, as I decrease that number, this
number is one, by the way.

430
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,920
When I decrease that number to one, it's
looking more ellipsoidal, it's not.

431
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,690
And as I keep going lower and lower, and

432
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,120
actually the Hessian, the hessian of this
thing, at the analytic center

433
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:41,080
is actually a good ellipse quadratic
summary, of the shape of this set, right?

434
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,910
So that, that, that's a good, a good way
to do that, right?

435
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,710
So, so actually, in a lot of cases where,
you know, you know how to do something,

436
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,960
if you had a quadratic representation or
something like that.

437
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,040
We'll see optimization methods, where this
is the case or

438
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,829
statistical methods, where this is the
case.

439
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,290
But you don't have anything like that.

440
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,630
What you have, is a complicated convex
set.

441
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,430
One option, is to do something like this.

442
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,300
I mean, another option, of course,

443
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,450
is calculate maximum volume ellipsoid
inside it, and so on, okay.

444
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,060
Now, it turns out here, there are
guaranteed approximations, right?

445
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,630
So, one is this.

446
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,800
It turns out, that if you form the
following.

447
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,510
So, the inner ellipsoid is, you go to the
center and

448
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,080
you take the ellipsoid given, defined by
the hessian of the analytic center,

449
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,540
that actually, with a one here, that
always lies inside the set, and

450
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,330
this one, always lies outside the set,
covers the set.

451
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,250
This is a worse approximation ratio, than
the maximum volume one, right?

452
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,860
And the reason is this, this number here
is m, let's call it m squared.

453
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,980
You take the square root and that gives
you the expansion size, right?

454
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,940
So it says, that if you, I mean it says
this, it says,

455
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,210
that if you take this thing, here, that's
shown in dark, in shaded here.

456
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,510
That ellipsoid is inside this set and

457
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,685
if I expand it by a factor m, which is by
the way, not the ambiance base dimension.

458
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:09,070
It's actually the number of inequalities,
but

459
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,890
the inequalities is at least, n plus 1,
because it takes n plus 1,

460
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,010
in equalities, in our n, to get a bounded
region.

461
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,280
And if you have n plus 1, you have a
simplex, right?

462
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,320
So, that's the so, this is a worse
approximation ratio.

463
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,430
So, I mean, it's not clear that matters,
right?

464
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,780
Oh one question here.

465
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,210
Here, I have let's see, 1, 2, 3, I have
six inequalities,

466
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,650
but analytic center is not a function of
set, it's a function of the inequalities.

467
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,540
What if I added a new inequality, that
looked like that, so it says, it says,

468
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,090
please stay on this side of that
inequality, shift select?

469
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,570
Exactly, right?

470
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,380
And in fact, the following is true.

471
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,830
Given a polyhedron or actually, just, just
given a set,

472
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,482
I can take any point in the interior and
pile up a bunch of, this is a,

473
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:04,490
you could call that a redundant, or
irrelevant, inequality, right?

474
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,290
It doesn't do, it doesn't change the set.

475
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,250
So I can pile up redundant inequalities
and I can, I can get you,

476
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,190
I can get any point in the interior, to be
the analytic center, right?

477
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,890
So the, all that says is, analytic center
is a,

478
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:23,480
is an attribute of the description of the
set, not the set itself, 'kay?

479
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,472
So, so technically it's not, it's not a
question of geometry,

480
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:34,039
right, it has to do with the description,
okay.

481
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,718
[BLANK_AUDIO]

482
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:40,390
Another topic is Linear Discrimination.

483
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,130
So, and if you've had a course on sort of,
machine learning or

484
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,540
something like that, or modern statistics,
you'll, you've seen things like this.

485
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,390
So, here's the problem.

486
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,120
This is actually also, quite an old
problem.

487
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,940
I think it goes back, at least to the 40s,
something like that.

488
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,400
I don't know how old the perceptron
algorithm is, but.

489
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:05,780
So you have a set of points, x1 through
xn, y1 through ym, and in some, rn.

490
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,420
And the idea is to determine, whether
they, you can separate them by hyperplane,

491
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,550
and if so, find such a hyperplane, right?

492
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,090
And there's actually a few tricks here,
you want to watch very carefully in

493
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,490
the next few minutes, because you will be
doing these things yourself.

494
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,170
And the arguments are, well they're not
totally subtle,

495
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,510
but, I mean, you have to, all I'm saying
is, you better listen, okay?

496
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,800
That, that, that's the right way to do it.

497
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,040
So, here and I'll, I'll, I'll go over it a
bit slowly.

498
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,960
So, what it is, is, you really want to
know, whether or

499
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,240
not, this set of inequalities is feasible?

500
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,440
Now, the first thing you notice about
those inequalities, is they're strict.

501
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,680
And you might say, hey, wait a minute,
we've been doing this class for

502
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,090
a long time, we haven't seen strict
inequalities before, right?

503
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,350
And then you might say something like
this.

504
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,820
You might think about it for a minute, and
this would generally,

505
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,520
it would generally be true, the following
would be true.

506
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,499
If your problem, if the difference between
a strict inequality and

507
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:07,245
a non-strict inequality, like changes your
problem.

508
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:09,810
That's kind of a, mathematical pathology,
right?

509
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,340
You know what i'm saying, right?

510
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,600
If you say, hey, I just built a you know,
I, I, I just built a, a, a machine that

511
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,080
gives, you know, the correct dose on a, on
a tumor or something like that.

512
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,110
And I can satisfy these inequalities, and
someone says, oh, you know,

513
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,540
what are they which inequalities can you?

514
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,460
You say, I can do the non-strict one.

515
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,790
You go, no, no, it has to be strict.

516
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,510
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense.

517
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,900
No sense whatsoever, right?

518
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,940
Because the difference between the two, I
mean it can hardly matter that,

519
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,994
that if it turns out, the difference
between putting 49.999 grays on

520
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:48,300
some on some tumor voxel, and 50.

521
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,260
If that really makes a difference, then
give up and

522
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,050
go home, because this doesn't make any
sense, this is not the real world, right?

523
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,960
Or that would be something like in
finance, a hedge fund.

524
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
You come back and you go, oh, great news,

525
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,270
I can, I can, I can get this return, with
this risk level.

526
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,710
And they go, equal, equal to the risk
level, or less than?

527
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,970
I mean, the answer is, your risk model is
so ridiculous, it's just totally made up,

528
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,660
so the point is, if somebody is telling
you, there's a difference between strict

529
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,200
inequality and non strict inequality, it
just makes no sense.

530
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,560
Everybody follow me on this?

531
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,210
Okay, right.

532
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,660
So, let's apply that common sense
principle here.

533
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,110
Let's take this and go like this, like
that, okay?

534
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,980
There you go.

535
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,180
Now you tell me.

536
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,420
Now, now the, the I mean the good news is,
the problem has become actually,

537
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,560
substantially easier.

538
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,320
So the answer is, a equals b equals 0, is
feasible, okay?

539
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,300
Everybody, everybody got that?

540
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,070
Okay, alright.
So, so

541
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,360
that didn't, so, the, the, the standard
method, right, didn't work here.

542
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,130
Okay, so that means that, the common
method doesn't work.

543
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,060
Okay, so let's do something.

544
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,580
Here, you have to be a bit more subtle.

545
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,090
What you do, is you observe, that these
inequalities are homogeneous, in a and

546
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,000
b, okay?

547
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,940
So that's, in other words, if, if there's
a and b for which [COUGH] ai transpose x

548
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,540
plus b is positive, then I guarantee you,
there's a and b for which, a transpose x

549
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:13,080
plus b, is bigger and equal to sorry is,
is, is bigger and equal to 1 okay?

550
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,600
Why?

551
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,110
I mean, you just scale them all up, until
it's true, right?

552
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,760
So what it says is, we replace this with
this, and

553
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,050
I would strongly recommend that you, you
know, go to a quiet place and make

554
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:28,380
sure you understand exactly, the semantics
of, what went down there, right, right?

555
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,280
It is not the same as saying,

556
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,630
that a strict inequality is always the
same as replacing with 1, right?

557
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,290
So you have to make the observation,

558
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,780
that these are homogeneous, that I can
scale them.

559
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,520
And there, then this is, then, then they
become equivalent, okay?

560
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,380
So, that's the, that's the idea.

561
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,520
This is a bona fide set of linear
inequalities.

562
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,290
And in fact, that's a linear program, in a
and b, right?

563
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,130
So, interestingly, questions about linear
discrimination, it took a,

564
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,170
unfortunately a shock, a much longer time
than it should have, for

565
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:09,360
somebody to look up one day and say, oh
hey, that's a linear program, right?

566
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,550
So, so sadly, historically, but, but it
really did.

567
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:17,330
In fact, whole algorithms were worked out,
to solve these kinds of things,

568
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,360
before it was understood, that other
people had worked out,

569
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,260
other whole algorithms to solve these
kinds of things, and so on and so forth.

570
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,700
I mean, now I think, that is even a legacy
of that, in current machine learning.

571
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,393
I mean, there's some weird,

572
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:33,350
anywyay, maybe I won't go, I won't go any
farther, but, okay, alright.

573
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,590
So what does this say?

574
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,900
This says, that if I give you a bunch of
points, pairs of points and you know,

575
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,840
these might be like labels or say
something like that.

576
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,920
Then, it says, I can now, by solving an
lp, I can determine if they are,

577
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,628
you would know, linearly separable or
linearly discriminable, right?

578
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,950
So, you could test, and, if you can,

579
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,620
if they are, you can exhibit or deduce a
the separating hyperplane.

580
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,760
Now, you can optimize over that
hyperplane,

581
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,010
we're going to see that next, right?

582
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,740
Like, you could, you know, find the
smallest one, or,

583
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,990
we'll see all sorts of things you could
work, you could optimize now, right?

584
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,780
And what would be the idea behind this?

585
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,310
Well, it might be something like this.

586
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,950
This is a giant pile of data.

587
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,590
Here, in fact you'd call this you, you'd
say labels, right?

588
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,040
So you'd, these would be feature vectors,
right?

589
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,780
So this is, I look at, let's say, 1
billion emails, right?

590
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,130
Each one is labeled, as either spam and
not spam, right?

591
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,800
So that's, I don't know, that's spam,
that's not spam, okay?

592
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,440
And how do I know that?

593
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Because I watched, when someone junked
something or something like that, so

594
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,280
I got a pretty good idea of the labels.

595
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,180
And let's say, each of these is a, I have
a feature that's, let's say, I'll be

596
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,630
safe here, let's make it just like, five,
10,000 features, right, for each email.

597
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,350
And make it, a lot of these features,

598
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,820
these features are kind of obvious,
they're, what you think they would be.

599
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,088
They'd be things like word counts and
things like that.

600
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:04,790
Alright, so you'd take a billion of these
points, some Xs, some Ys, right?

601
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,070
And then you'd want to know, in R1000 or
10,000, whatever we, however many features

602
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,205
we decided there were, you'd like to know,
if there was a hyperplane in between them.

603
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:17,685
And, but if there were a hyperplane, then
you, then it'd be easy because now,

604
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:18,540
you'd take that hyperplane.

605
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,600
A new email comes in, you compute its
feature vector, find out,

606
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,020
which side of the hyperplane you're on,
and either announce it's spam, or not.

607
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,760
And in fact, even the distance of the
hyperplane would tell you something,

608
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,870
like if it was way off, in, on one side,
you might say,

609
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,060
with high confidence, that it is spam or
not.

610
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,270
Everybody got this?

611
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,410
Okay.
Now actually, you would be quite nervous,

612
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,525
if, in fact, it separated.

613
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:43,050
[LAUGH] Right?

614
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,400
There'd be something deeply wrong, in, in
this case, but

615
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,460
at least, that's abstractly the idea, of
the use of these types of things, right?

616
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,620
So, okay, we will get to that.

617
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,590
So it turns out, actually, a very simple
varia, very simple variation on this,

618
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,230
produces something that's actually
extremely effective, right, so.

619
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,910
Okay, so the first thing we're going to
look at, is this.

620
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,100
If you, you have a set of linear
inequalities, right?

621
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,870
That just detects a hyperplane, but the
point is, there's lots of hyperplanes that

622
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,060
separate two clouds of points, if they're
separable.

623
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,990
If they're linearly discriminable, there's
lots of hyperplanes.

624
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,770
So the, by the way,

625
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,190
there's lots of ways you could choose a
hyperplane that separates them, right?

626
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,490
They're lots of reasonable ways to do it.

627
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,120
One way would be to do some kind of
robustness thing, and

628
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,590
one would do that, you would do something
like this.

629
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,060
You can imagine the, the hyperplane is, a
transpose z, plus b is 0, right?

630
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,204
But instead, what we could do is, we could
take the point where that's one and

631
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:43,370
minus one, and everything in between those
two parallel hyperplanes,

632
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,610
that's a slab, right?

633
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,800
And then, we could very reasonably ask to
find,

634
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,190
to compute the maximum width slab, that
separates the two points, right?

635
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,160
And by the way, what's nice about that, I
mean,

636
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,330
some people will call this thing the
maximum margin classifier, right?

637
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,310
And the reason it's maximum margin is
that,

638
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,700
you can puff up each of these points, by a
ball.

639
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,850
Still classfiied correctly, and the amount
you can puff 'em up by,

640
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,430
is the largest possible, and still
maintain correctness.

641
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,180
Everybody got that?

642
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,744
So, it's maximum margin classifier
[INAUDIBLE].

643
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:20,360
Okay, completely reasonable, right?

644
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,310
But, the width of the slab is exactly, 2
over the norm of a, right?

645
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,180
So, that's the right?

646
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,250
I mean, if the norm of a were 1, then,
well, a trans plus x plus b,

647
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,590
literally is the signed distance to the
hyperplane, if the norm of a is 1.

648
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,560
If norm of a is big, then in fact the slab
is small, right?

649
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,540
So, okay.

650
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,848
So, then it says, please let's maximize
[COUGH] 2 over the norm of a2.

651
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:53,750
That's the same as minimizing norm, a2,
and so you'd say, minimize the norm of a2,

652
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,550
subject to these inequalities, and now we
get a qp, and that, that's the maximum

653
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,950
margin classifier, if I'm saying that
correctly, in whatever dialect that is.

654
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,230
Oh, and I guess they would do this,
because it's not,

655
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,960
yeah, you'd have to square the objective,
you'd do something like that, right?

656
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,560
It'd be the same thing, okay.

657
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,900
Okay so now, now if two sets are
separable, linearly separable,

658
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,340
we at least, have a very nice, a, and
utterly reasonable way to to find

659
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,890
a hyperplane that separates them.

660
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,060
It's kind of like it clearly has some good
properties, okay.

661
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,660
A very interesting thing,

662
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,670
is to look at the dual of this, and we'll
do that quickly.

663
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,210
So, I, I just mechanically worked out the
dual of, of the separation problem.

664
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:46,400
So, the dual of this problem right, this
maximum margin

665
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,180
problem is exactly this, it's maximize
this function, subject to.

666
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,480
And here, what you see, is something very
interesting.

667
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,580
I get two sets of, of I get two sets of
lagrange multipliers, lambda and mu,

668
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,990
they are associated exactly, with the two
sets of linear inequalities, right?

669
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,810
The, the for the Xs and for

670
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,980
the Ys, I have these kind of, inequalities
go the wrong way.

671
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,480
And you get some very interesting
constraints, I get a norm constraint here,

672
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,010
these are, well, those are inequalities,
so, these things are non-negative.

673
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,930
And I get this equality constraint here.

674
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,730
So, again, everything is homogeneous here.

675
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,620
So, what we're going to do is the
following, is,

676
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:31,780
I'm going to normalize these things here
to be, I'll take both of these to be one,

677
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,940
whereupon, lambda and mu become well,
they're probability distributions or

678
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,990
they are, I don't know, they're convex
mixtures, right?

679
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,730
They're, they're numbers that are
non-negative, and add up to one.

680
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,480
But, if these are numbers that add up non
negative, and

681
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,430
add up to one, these two things are really
simple.

682
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,458
They are elem, they are arbitrary elements
in the convex hull,

683
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:58,778
of the x-point cloud and the y-point
cloud, right?

684
00:39:58,778 --> 00:39:59,430
And so,

685
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,950
that says, I can rewrite the problem to
look like this, and it's really beautiful.

686
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,020
It says, it basically says, take the
convex hull of the x-point cloud,

687
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,840
convex hull of the y-point cloud, and
actually calculate,

688
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,480
that's an arbitrary point in one,
arbitrary point in the other.

689
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,500
And it says, this is the epigraph, I mean,

690
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,390
minimizing t subject is the same as just,
you just minimize this thing here.

691
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,620
It, it's actually says, find the minimum
distance between two

692
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,740
ellipse two polyhedra, described by their
vertices.

693
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,150
Everybody got that?

694
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,130
So that was it, it makes perfect sense.

695
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,910
So now you know, when are two point,

696
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,030
when are two point clouds separable,
linearly separable.

697
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,920
The answer is, if and only if, and
straight from duality is this, it's if and

698
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,840
only if, the convex hulls don't intersect,
that's it, 'kay?

699
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,160
So the, and that's duality, right?

700
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,898
That's, that's exactly what duality is.

701
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:54,023
[COUGH] Everybody, everybody, this doesn't
say anything, but

702
00:40:54,023 --> 00:40:56,276
it's just fun to look at, right?

703
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:59,040
So, okay.

704
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,320
Now, we're going to get to the, to a real
case.

705
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,640
And in fact, it's one of those things,

706
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,790
where you just add one more, one more
feature to this one, to the problem.

707
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,360
And then it goes from being, hm, maybe not
so

708
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,370
useful, to off-scale unbelievably useful,
okay?

709
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,430
So, those who've taken a modern statistics
or

710
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,810
machine learning course, know what's
going to happen now, so.

711
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,486
But anyway, so if you just sit tight,
everything will be fine.

712
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:28,820
alright, so what you do is this, and in
fact, I want to,

713
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,450
before we even get into this I want to
talk about.

714
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,060
Let's start the story this way, I give you
some x's and

715
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,230
I give you some y's, these are feature
vectors for spam and for, not spam.

716
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,930
You calculate, whether there's a
separating hyperplane and

717
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,310
there isn't, right?

718
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,940
And that's probably good, right?

719
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,470
Oh, by the way, if the two point clouds
are like totally, you know, if, if,

720
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,420
if they're totally on top of each other,
so there's no difference, that's not good.

721
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,920
That means, you've picked some pretty poor
features, okay, right?

722
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,470
But there's some point is that, two point
clouds are there, they do,

723
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,820
the two, the two convex hulls intersect,
period.

724
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,210
In other words, there are spam feature
vectors, that penetrate into,

725
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,860
whatever the non-spam territory, every, I
mean this is just, just a picture.

726
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,770
Okay, and so the question is,

727
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:21,912
how would you let's skip what I have on
the slide here.

728
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,560
What would you imagine, you might want to
do?

729
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,720
So, you have a, a million linear
inequalities, you want to satisfy, and

730
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,630
they're not mutually satisfiable.

731
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,660
Yeah, so I have a whole bunch of
inequalities, I want to satisfy.

732
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,870
I solve an lp, and I announce with total
confidence, th, there is no hyperplane.

733
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,988
I ca, cannot satisfy all these
inequalities, it's impossible.

734
00:42:43,988 --> 00:42:46,730
So the nat, I think the most natural
things you might want to do next,

735
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,240
would be to say, okay fine, find me a
hyperplane,

736
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,000
that minimizes the number of, of
inequalities you violate.

737
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,155
Now if, if you want to think about a,

738
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:01,060
a classification problem, that's the
number of missed classifications, right?

739
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,720
And by the way, if that number were like
0.5%, you'd be very happy.

740
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,690
You wouldn't, but okay.

741
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,640
At, at, at some point in time, in the
past, for spam detection, you would be,

742
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,400
you would've been very happy, right?

743
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,610
For a lot of problems, you'd be delighted,
right?

744
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,030
Everybody see what I'm saying?

745
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,300
So you, so you, so then the problem is to
figure out,

746
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,930
which ones can you not, how do you
minimize the number?

747
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,840
Okay, well, and by the way,

748
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,090
then you might ask yourself, what kind of
an optimization problem is that?

749
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,770
And you would find out pretty quickly,
that, that is np hard.

750
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,940
So, I give you a set of inequalities, and

751
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,118
I ask you to satisfy as many as you can,
it's np hard, okay?

752
00:43:36,118 --> 00:43:37,123
Fine, okay.

753
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:42,972
So then, you'd say, well maybe there's a
heuristic for this.

754
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,400
And what does this mean?

755
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,060
This means, that the violations are
sparse.

756
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,130
You, you know, if there's going to be
violations, and, by the way, the l1 norm

757
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,970
should be the right thing here, because it
says, you know, it's got a v.

758
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,910
I mean, you see, it's not quite an l1
norm, but it's exactly the same.

759
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,370
Actually, it is an l1 norm, for something
that's positive.

760
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,690
You know, and it's something, it means,

761
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,850
what you want is, something that keeps up
the pressure to drive you to zero.

762
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:10,020
But if you have to violate, it shouldn't
go nuts, it should not be a function,

763
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,285
a penalty that grows, it just should grow
linearly, okay?

764
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,290
Okay.
So, that's the idea.

765
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,460
So, in fact, that leads you immediately,
to the following.

766
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,440
Let me do it, this, I'll write it another
way.

767
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,450
I'll write, ai transpose x plus b, I want
that to be bigger than one, okay?

768
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,070
So, I want this thing to be bigger than
zero, that's what I want.

769
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,880
Now, I know that I can't, I actually can't
chose an A and a B.

770
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,050
Well, that one and the other ones, so that
all these inequalities hold.

771
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,845
Everybody following this?

772
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:43,900
So, I want that, I if that's positive, I'm
totally happy, right?

773
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,170
So, you might do something like this, you
might form,

774
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,510
ai transpose x plus b minus 1, the minus
part, okay?

775
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,640
If you satisfy that inequality, that
gives, there's no bill here,

776
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,640
you don't pay anything, right?

777
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,880
But if this thing becomes negative, then
you start paying, and

778
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,940
you pay linearly, ever.

779
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,700
So, what, what function is that?

780
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,890
That's a function that looks like this,
right?

781
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,950
Looks like that, right?

782
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,970
And this is called the margin, in the
inequality, and what this says,

783
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,960
if your margin's positive, no charge
whatsoever, if it's negative,

784
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,190
you charge linearly for, negative margins,
right?

785
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,270
Ever, everybody's sort of, following this,
okay?

786
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,200
Now, when you look at that, and by the
way, it helps to turn your head about

787
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,240
40 degrees then l1, your l1 part of your
brain will light up, okay?

788
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,870
I mean, it's the same thing, right?

789
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:36,430
Okay?

790
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,040
So, and, by the way, this is called hinge
loss, is, is the name for

791
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,860
this, in several, in several fields.

792
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:47,431
I think that, in both, in modern
statistics and in machine learning.

793
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:49,160
Anyway, so, that's hinge loss.

794
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,440
And so it suggests, that actually, doing
something like this,

795
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,100
adding that in, would be a great idea
because you know,

796
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,950
it doesn't look like l1, but by the time
you see this, I mean it should,

797
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,540
l1 is not to be taken literally, although
a lot of people do.

798
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,750
This is l1, right?

799
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,280
Actually, it's linear plus l1, so it
actually, kind of is.

800
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,300
But you look at that, and, and, sparsity,
the sparsity part of your brain,

801
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,790
should be lighting up, okay?

802
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,620
Right?
And, what does it mean, if this is sparse?

803
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,320
It's super cool.

804
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,180
If that's sparse, it says the following.

805
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,852
It says that, you satisfy most, it means
that, that mis-classifications, these

806
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:30,371
are not by the way, mis-classifications,
there's even a little extra there,

807
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,870
because the one, without the one, it's
mis-classification, right?

808
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,378
This says that, mis-classifications are
sparse, that's exactly what you want.

809
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,000
Everybody following this?

810
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,230
I mean, that was a very long story, but
the idea is, and I just wanted to give,

811
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,670
I just wanted to give the whole, like,
everything, about what you're doing here.

812
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,020
Okay, so that's what this is.

813
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,620
u, is a slack variable here.

814
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,170
I mean, this is the way, this is the
traditional description of it.

815
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,820
actually, this is a more modern
description, you don't even introduce use,

816
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,520
because you just look at it, you say, it's
convex, done, right?

817
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,050
That's the correct way to do it, in my
opinion.

818
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,060
But we'll do it the traditional way.

819
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,930
The traditional way, is you say, I would
like to satisfy this inequality and

820
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,340
this one it's determined that you cannot,
and then you go,

821
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,750
oh, okay fine, then you add in slacks.

822
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,311
Now the slacks are, by the way, nothing,
but these things, right?

823
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:22,690
So, a slack is something that says, fine,
I'll subtract something from the one,

824
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,880
to make it easier to satisfy this, and
I'll do the same here.

825
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,190
I'll make the inequality easier, easier to
use in Vs, those are [INAUDIBLE], and

826
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,920
then, I'll minimize those.

827
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,580
And by the way, you'll find out, this
problem is absolutely identical to

828
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,940
the problem of this, plus of course the,
the opposite ones, the, for the Ys, right?

829
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,680
So, you get exactly the same problem,
okay?

830
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,630
Everybody, following this?

831
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,990
Okay, so that, and, and, and

832
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,690
you should even think of this, it's a
beautiful thing.

833
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:57,140
You should think of this thing, as the l1
type heuristic,

834
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,340
for solving the following hard [INAUDIBLE]
problem.

835
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,780
Find me a hyperplane, that satisfies as
many, you know,

836
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,580
that mis-classifies as few as possible,
right?

837
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,850
So, that's the correct interpretation of
this, okay?

838
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,350
And you get something like that, you know,
here's a case.

839
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,290
Okay.
Now the only thing you have to do now,

840
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,880
is you put the two together and you have
something kind of famous, right?

841
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,630
So and I guess the traditional one, I
think the traditional one,

842
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,860
would look something like that, right?

843
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,880
So, but at the, you get the same trade-off
curve.

844
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,290
So what you do now is this is, you put
slacks in, to minimize, to,

845
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:39,060
for the for, for actually,
mis-classifying, right?

846
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,340
And then you, at the same time,

847
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,856
and you could also think of this as
regularization, by the way, so here,

848
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:50,110
traditional l2 regularization, turns out
to have a beautiful

849
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,860
geometric interpretation, because when
you're minimizing the norm of A,

850
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,260
I guess you call it the weight vector or
something like that.

851
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,380
If you're minimizing over the weight
vector, it turns out,

852
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,980
that's equivalent to, geometrically, to
saying, don't look for a hyperplane,

853
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,850
look for a slab, and, in fact, maximize
the width of the slab, which means,

854
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,100
that you've separated them well.

855
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,390
Everybody, kind of seeing all these things
go together?

856
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,570
So, I mean, for people who've seen this
before, that's fine,

857
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,120
you may not have seen the geometric
interpretation,

858
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,480
the full geometric interpretations, but
now you have.

859
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,400
So, it's actually kind of, kind of cool.

860
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,290
So, this, this is given the name, support
vector machine.

861
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,920
Here, you have a parameter, and the
parameter is very simple.

862
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,930
It trades off, the parameter, now describe
it geometrically, and

863
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,300
there are statistical interpretations of
all of these, going to go into them.

864
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,550
But there are so the geometric
interpretation is quite beautiful.

865
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:47,070
lambda, or gamma here, sorry, trades off
the width [COUGH] of the slab.

866
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,050
and, and this this is going to be very
rough the viol,

867
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,090
the number of inequality violations, okay?

868
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,450
And that's what it does.

869
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,510
Right, and so you can imagine what, what,
what turning that parameter will do, here.

870
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,510
This is unbelievably, widely used.

871
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,760
I mean that is much as [INAUDIBLE] squared
or

872
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,550
something like that, but it's catching up,
let me put it that way.

873
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,770
So, it's used tons of places, everywhere
all the time, right?

874
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:17,680
So, you couldn't possibly get through a
day, here, except if you're like,

875
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,850
hiking in Yosemite or something, and
maybe, even then you couldn't.

876
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,710
when, when something you did, didn't run
through, a support vector classifier.

877
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,730
I mean, I'm not, it would be, you'd have
to touch no electronics, and I don't know,

878
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,600
what else you, you'd have to do.

879
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,380
So, but, be very hard to, very hard to do,
and you don't, certainly don't pick up

880
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,900
your phone or anything like, don't, don't
read email, because then it's all over.

881
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,800
so, anyway, so.

882
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,070
These are good things to know.

883
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:47,170
Okay, let's look at the idea of non-linear
discrimination.

884
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,820
So, here, I, we've been looking at linear
discrimination.

885
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,600
We can just as well look at, non-linear
discrimination because in fact, it turns

886
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,010
out that, the fact that the classifier was
linear, was totally irrelevant.

887
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,945
All that mattered, was that it was linear
in the parameters, right?

888
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:06,160
So, non-linear classification says, find
me a function f,

889
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:12,250
that is you know, positive on, on the x's,
negative on the y's, okay?

890
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,630
So, so, here's one approach to it.

891
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,360
Actually, there's multiple approaches
here.

892
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,360
I mean, one which doesn't fit in this
theme but, we could talk about but,

893
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,410
don't have time to, would be, sort of
kernel methods, but, we're not.

894
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,430
Instead, we're going to look at
somethings, that's much simpler and

895
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,690
that fits with the theme of, context
optimization.

896
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:35,402
What you do, is you simply take a set of
basis functions here.

897
00:51:35,402 --> 00:51:39,054
And what you're going to do, is you're
going to look a,

898
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:44,580
at a finite dimensional, set of candidate
functions, that's all.

899
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,977
And, you know, these are basis functions,
right, f1 through fk, right?

900
00:51:47,977 --> 00:51:49,560
They could be anything you'd like.

901
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,888
So, it could be polynomials.

902
00:51:51,888 --> 00:51:55,439
They could be weird exponentials, they
could be things that,

903
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:58,540
that pertain to your particular problem,
right?

904
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,990
I don't know, I, I don't know why, but

905
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,980
I mean that, you know, could be, these
could be prolade spheroids, or

906
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,790
something like that, or bessel functions
of some order, I, I don't know.

907
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,000
We, they could, you just, they could be
anything, right?

908
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,430
These could be the eigenfunctions of some,

909
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,800
of some partial differential operator,
right?

910
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,020
Doesn't matter, right, it's just supposed
to be

911
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,420
functions you're going to linearly
combine, to do separation, okay.

912
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
So here, it's the same thing.

913
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,210
You just end up with, I mean,

914
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,740
absolutely nothing whatsoever, is
different, I mean nothing.

915
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,170
Right, so that's, that's what you get.

916
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,970
And so, this tells you, can do fun things
like this,

917
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:40,660
you could say, [COUGH] please separate my
points quadratically, okay?

918
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,920
And that says, find me a quadratic
function,

919
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,220
that's a general quadratic function.

920
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,550
And what's being asked, is that you should
find P, Q, and

921
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,240
R, those are the variables, that separates
your points.

922
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,890
Okay, so here's an example of,
quadratically separable points, right?

923
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,830
And this, by the way,

924
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:02,150
goes back to our question of, what would
you do with those ellipsoids?

925
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,570
This would be, if you had two types of
data.

926
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,440
You had places where, let's say, a pilot
flown and came back.

927
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,775
Let's suppose, that's the things inside,
now, and these are the ones,

928
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:16,300
where there was no recovery, that's a
little bit gruesome, sorry.

929
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,750
So, something else, but that's the idea,
okay?

930
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,077
And, so this would be the case, and it's a
linear program, to compute, and

931
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:29,160
to compute, actually, just quadratically
separation.

932
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,890
Now quadratic separation by itself,

933
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,900
does not require, there's no curvature
constraint, right?

934
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,980
So, in fact, in this case, it could, you
could, you might as well, you,

935
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,360
you could, if you just do a straight
quadratic classification,

936
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,360
you could actually be looking for a
hyperbola, that, that separates them.

937
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,830
Everybody following this?

938
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,798
Right, and if you know, depending on what
your data is,

939
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:51,440
that can be completely reasonable and
interest, interesting.

940
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,520
Everybody got this?

941
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,680
If you want to insist, that for example,
if you say, find me an ellipsoid that

942
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:04,550
covers these points, but not those, then
you simply add a constraint that says,

943
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,040
that the p, is less than or equal to,

944
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,830
actually, you would add p negative
definite, for example, to get ellipsoid or

945
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,980
the ex, exterior of an ellipsoid b, would
be p positive definite.

946
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,112
That's homogenous, and that translates to
this, okay?

947
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:21,420
And now ,you have sdp.

948
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,590
Everybody following this?

949
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,350
So, this is the idea.

950
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,160
I mean, here's a quasi convex problem.

951
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,230
It says, here's two sets of points, and

952
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:35,706
this says, please separate them by the
minimum degree polynomial, nr2.

953
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,887
Everybody got that?

954
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:41,010
And without even saying anything, you
should understand that,

955
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,325
that is quasi convex.

956
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:43,840
[COUGH] Why?

957
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,810
In fact, how is that done?

958
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,740
How is that figure done?

959
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,170
You take the two sets of points, and
what's the first thing you try to do?

960
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,780
You first try to separate them.

961
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,515
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> By linear, and you can't, okay?

962
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,110
because we're looking at the data, you
cannot, okay?

963
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,700
And that doesn't work.

964
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,990
So now you try quadratic, and you cannot,
okay?

965
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,580
Then you try cubic, and you can't.

966
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,390
And then you try quadratic, and you can.

967
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,750
Everybody, so that's, that's the idea.

968
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,700
I mean, I don't know, why you'd want to,
and

969
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,350
by the way, I mean, one of the nice things
about these sort of,

970
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,450
convex formulations is, here, we're
showing you the simple ones, but

971
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,470
in fact, you can just, you know, you can,
yeah it's like cooking.

972
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,880
You can add stuff in and things like that.

973
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,042
I mean for example here, suppose instead,
you want to say yeah, this is,

974
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,590
oh yeah, this is what I want to do, I
really want to do that.

975
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,200
But you know what, it doesn't work
exactly, and

976
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,490
I don't mind, if a few end up
mis-classified.

977
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,170
Everybody following this?

978
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,430
So, what do you, what would you do?

979
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,640
Yeah, yeah you had the u and the v the
slacks, or

980
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,910
whatever you like, and then, you know, and

981
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:53,250
then, and then, you have a parameter, that
would trade off various things, right?

982
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,160
I mean so that, that's, that's exactly
what you do.

983
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,170
You add in u and v, and, then you'd end
up, computing an ellipsoid and

984
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,930
there would be hope, if you're lucky,
couple of points outside, couple of,

985
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,190
couple of points on, eh, on either side of
their boundary, that went the wrong way.

986
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,310
Everybody got this?

987
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,270
So, it's, it's okay.

988
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,040
So that's, I mean, you get it.
