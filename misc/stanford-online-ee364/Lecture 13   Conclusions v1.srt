1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,990
What I want to do is just talk, a little
bit, very briefly about sort of

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,880
the main ideas of the course and just a
couple of other things.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,490
So, some of this is kind of obvious but
it's probably worth saying now.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,090
So when we talk about modeling, that's
kind of the focus of the course is on,

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,270
is on, is on modeling.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,230
Right?
Yeah it is, look.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,540
A lot of problems in things like
engineering design, statistics,

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,830
machine learning economics.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,710
Management, you know, goes on in signal
processing.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,320
You know?
All of these kinds of things.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,240
You can express them as mathematical
optimization problems, right?

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,160
So, I mean, this is kind of obvious,
right?

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,240
But, actually, you'd be shocked at how few
people, make it over that step.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,750
And this business of yeah I mean real
problems are really multi objective but

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,320
once you know about optimization, it's not
a big deal to, to look at, you know,

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,720
to have something, be a constrain or a
trade off between three things or

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,980
something like that I mean.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,050
So, that's fine.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,980
Now, we focus on a canonical form, where
we identify one objective as

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,140
infinitely soft and all others as
infinitely hard.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,570
I mean, that's, that's fine, but

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,640
everyone should know that real problems,
there's a trade off among some of them.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,270
I mean, some are really non-negotiable,
right?

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,080
You know, like covariances should
definitely be positive semi-definite,

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,270
for example, right?

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,020
Powers?

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,066
Definitely should be bigger and equal to
0.

28
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:22,490
These are non negotiable, but a lot of the
others are.

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,740
Are, are, are.

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,620
Not, and the main point is something like
this,

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,840
that roughly speaking, the tractable
problems are the ones that are convex.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,430
And, you know, that's kind of rough.

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,380
And, I mean you could even go more than,

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,510
you could make the radical assertion is
that, that's not a rough statement.

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,170
That's just true and the or if you wanted
to push the radical statement I,

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm not sure I believe the radical
statement and

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,710
I'm not sure if it has any implications
even if you did.

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,470
So I'm not sure it matters.

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,620
You would argue that all the polynomially
type,

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,950
that all the polynomial time solvable
prob, discreet problems they all work

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,290
because say, some convex relaxation
actually has zero duality gap, right.

42
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,790
So you'd look at all this or, you know,
minimum you know,

43
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,050
find the shortest path between two points
in a weighted graph.

44
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,940
Right?

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,750
Okay.
Well,

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,860
you would say the convex relaxation of
that has zero duality gap.

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,510
Right?
I mean that's a bit silly because it,

48
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,400
then you ask the question, well great,

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,440
now that I know this, should I be solving,
you know, minimum distance and

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
graph, you know, shortest path problems
that way and the answer is no.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,600
Go back and use the same method you were
using before.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,820
So it doesn't really say anything.

53
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,570
The other source of non trivial problems
that would appear to be non convex.

54
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,120
And yet you can solve.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,330
And they are solved all the time, are
obvious.

56
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,120
They are singular values, eigenvalues,
PCA.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,140
There are obvious, right?

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,580
It turns out there, there is also a kind
of a weird connection to convexity.

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,270
For those problems.

60
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,650
The dual, actually is the semi-definite
product, problem, semi-definite program.

61
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,130
And it has zero duality gap.

62
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,750
There's zero duality gap for those, right?

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,080
So you could even argue.

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,230
I mean, that's a bit weird and extreme, to
walk up to someone, and say,

65
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,650
what are you doing in PCA or something.

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,570
And you say, how do you know it works?

67
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,790
And you go, well.

68
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,610
I mean, you know?

69
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,910
I'm, sure I'm getting the best whatever
rank 12 fit, or something like that.

70
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,970
By the way, that's not the one we just
looked at, the example, right?

71
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,654
Sure, I'm getting, how do you know, well
it's the global solution and so

72
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:30,270
on, it really doesn't help to say, oh I
can tell you why.

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,310
It's because of some result in algebraic
geometry that the semi

74
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,540
definite programming dual of your PCA
problem, has zero duality gap.

75
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,420
That doesn't seem to me to be
illuminating.

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,480
It is true.

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,600
But it's not, doesn't seem to me to be
illuminating.

78
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,010
Okay, so, alright.

79
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,050
Now if you have a non convex problem, in
general.

80
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,840
You have [INAUDIBLE] , you have two
choices.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,310
And these are the two extremes.

82
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,130
Actually, there's everything in between.

83
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,880
And here they are.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,520
One is to give up on, is to actually
replace solution with solution.

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,360
And then a little asterisk, and then a
footnote that says.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,940
Maybe, right?

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,080
Or not really, right?

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,780
And it's just you're looking for a local
solution, and this is,

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,710
these are extremely useful with lots of
cases where this is very useful.

90
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,970
I mean engineering design, something like
that.

91
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,865
You really don't care if that is the,

92
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:26,630
is the lowest power design that meets all
your specification.

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,320
Right?
If it's, if it's low enough power, or

94
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,350
it's a 20% improvement over what you had
ten days ago, that's fantastic!

95
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,530
And you're, and you don't sit around and

96
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,290
worry about whether it's the global
solution.

97
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,650
Okay, so, very useful.

98
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,210
And these all have the same running time
as convex problems, right?

99
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,470
Now, at the other extreme, you have global
optimization.

100
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,290
And these will have exponential worse care
run time.

101
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,960
By the way, in a lot of practical cases,
they don't have exponential I mean, well,

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,140
I don't know what means.

103
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,850
Sorry.

104
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,590
In a lot of practical instances you can
actually solve these to completion, and

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,980
it's not so bad.

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,040
Right?
So.

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,700
And in fact what really happens is
anywhere where people actually do this,

108
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,500
they have a timeout and they run something
for a couple of minutes and they quit.

109
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,540
And you're really getting something in
between.

110
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,720
So.

111
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,260
Oh, one thing that's interesting is and

112
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,665
this is something that has come up you
know, in the last, like 20, 25 years.

113
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:23,660
It's been a slow thing if you accept
linear programming,

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,200
right, possibly quadratic programming
then.

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,760
You know, it was, it's, what's, this, it's
just been the last 25 years,

116
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,628
people have discovered a lot of problems
that actually are convex.

117
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,920
Or can be transformed to be convex, right?

118
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,579
And that, this was not, I mean, it's not
obvious.

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,030
Although I have some advice to give you.

120
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,900
So this is serious advice now.

121
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,870
So,.

122
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,040
Long time ago, I use to give a talk on, on
control, and I would say,

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,412
look, here are some problems in control
that you can reduce to convex problems.

124
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,180
And I'd show one, and another, and
everything.

125
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,760
I thought, well, it would be good, I
should show one that cannot be.

126
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,870
So, I showed one that I thought could not
be.

127
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,330
I said, here's one, and actually,

128
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,620
fortunately in the slides it said that
probably cannot be reduced to a con.

129
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,524
And it was something involving, you know,
finding a Lyapunov function and

130
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,720
the state feedback gain at the same time.

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
And I, I gave even a very good argument
for it, I said look they get

132
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,050
multiplied together and that's never good
for convexity, we know that, right.

133
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,100
I mean so they just, it wasn't looking
good.

134
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,480
Everybody following this?

135
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,120
And this is just in the spirit of, I just
showed you five things that can be

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,050
reduced to convex problems, I should show
one that cannot.

137
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,240
Okay.
So I gave the talk ten, fifteen times.

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,730
After the fifteenth time, somebody, Eddy
Packard at Berkley comes up to

139
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,380
me quietly and he goes, can I show you
something?

140
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,942
And I said, oh sure.

141
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:44,610
And he takes out a piece of paper and

142
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,780
he fills like about four lines at the top
of it.

143
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,950
And guess what?

144
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,320
The problem I had just, not just then but

145
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,380
15 earlier times, to large audiences, said
was non convex.

146
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,185
He did some sick change of variables,
right,

147
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,840
that no normal person should ever have
thought of.

148
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,112
[LAUGH] But there it was, guess what, it
was convex, it was four lines, right.

149
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:14,944
And then I, so, I, I, you know, I started
getting, you know, hyperventilating and

150
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:17,690
like, so I looked, I quickly looked back
at my slides.

151
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,135
And, sure enough, I was so lucky.

152
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:24,640
The, the top of it said a problem that
probably cannot be,

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,840
cannot be solved using convex
optimization.

154
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,490
And then I even had a footnote that said,
you know, as far as I know.

155
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,370
So, so anyway.

156
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,829
So, okay, so let me tell you what the
moral of that story is.

157
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,300
If you're, you know,

158
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,020
if you're with friends, it's informal, say
whatever you like.

159
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,700
Okay?

160
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,430
But, if you're out in some other place,
you should not,

161
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,540
don't look at something and say here are
the things that seem to be reasonable for

162
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,610
you to say in a semi-public setting.

163
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,400
Here are the things you can say.

164
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,570
You can say.

165
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,720
That problem is convex or

166
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,510
can be transformed or solved or, by convex
optimization.

167
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,230
That's okay, but I mean, if you know it's
true.

168
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,747
The second thing you can, if that problem
has not been shown to be mp hard,

169
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:09,940
you should be quite, quiet in, in, in
public or even semi public.

170
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,460
Kay?

171
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,820
So, that's my advice because I've been
I've been a victim of this.

172
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,540
So, alright.

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,670
Everybody got this?

174
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
So, okay.

175
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,580
Alright, so, what are the theoretical
consequences of convexity.

176
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,490
Well, you know, the simplest one is like,
you know,

177
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,790
if you have a local optimum, it's global,
right?

178
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,750
And so that's, and but by the way, that's
a very,

179
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,000
shallow idea of why this all works because
a lot, you explain this to someone,

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,230
a lot of people go, oh yeah, yeah, sure,
that makes total sense sure.

181
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,220
It turns out that's not right, for
example,

182
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,650
their optimization problems where.

183
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,860
All local optima are global and they are
hard.

184
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,868
Right.
So, this is not quite fair.

185
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,960
This is okay if it's just you know,

186
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,640
if you want to give a 20 second version of
why this.

187
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,910
This is why.

188
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,810
By the way local optima global,

189
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,290
that goes back to something very early on
in the class.

190
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,580
One interesting question is.

191
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,520
How can you conclude that from convexity,
right, and

192
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,220
the answer is really simple, in what
convexity allows you to do,

193
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,200
is it allows you to go from a local
statement to a global one, right.

194
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,000
If I know the gradient of a function at a
point,

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,010
I can produce a global lower bound, that.

196
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,210
If someone says, oh, wait a minute.

197
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,150
How could you possibly know that, that's
the best you could do?

198
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,890
That's ridiculous.

199
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,030
R100 is a big place.

200
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,980
R1000 is a lot bigger.

201
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,050
And the, that's the answer.

202
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,390
And you say, the answer is because of the
mathematical properties of

203
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,780
the functions involved, I can extrapolate
from here.

204
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,880
And know something globally about it.

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,070
I mean, then you get duality and all and
it gets more complicated but

206
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,730
that's basically where it comes from.

207
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,940
So there's an extensive duality theory.

208
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,620
What is that?

209
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Well, lots of ways to think of it.

210
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,425
One way is to say,

211
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,580
it's just a very systematic way to derive
lower bounds on optimal value.

212
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,710
That's what it is right, by the way that
alone is a very good met, you know,

213
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,540
you have a problem.

214
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,080
And now you say well, I mean if you can't
solve it or

215
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,514
something like that even if, especially if
it's not convexed,

216
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:09,525
it's even interesting, then you say, here
are some lower bounds.

217
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,570
If you come up with things that satisfy
these and

218
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,390
that should be something you should be
able to do then you'd say,

219
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,420
then this is a lower bound, right that's
actually very valuable often.

220
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,510
and, in the case of convex,

221
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,740
you get necessary insufficient conditions
for optimality.

222
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,710
And you get cool things like certificates
of infeasibility and math,

223
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,430
and theorem of alternatives for
inequalities.

224
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,310
Right?
And for a set.

225
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,260
That, that's also, that, that's the basis
of lots of things like, for

226
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,140
example, economics.

227
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,600
Right?
Just to name one.

228
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,070
Right?
So, because everything's based on

229
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,650
absence of arbitrage.

230
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,262
Right?

231
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,630
So, it's lots of other things like that.

232
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,170
And of course as a practical matter you
get something unbelievably useful which is

233
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,600
sensitivity analysis.

234
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Right?
So, when you solve a problem for

235
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,340
free you get to find out how sensitive is
that problem?

236
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,150
How sensitive is the optimal way of that
solution to any change in parameters.

237
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,900
Right?
If you're

238
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,950
doing engineering design that's
unbelievably useful.

239
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,440
Because it tells you how much, for

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,780
example that power constraint is really
limiting you.

241
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,900
Or your phase margin constraint.

242
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,360
This will tell you exactly.

243
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,440
I mean, at least in a protobational sense,

244
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,710
it'll tell you how much that is costing
you.

245
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,260
Right?

246
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,080
In statistics, in fitting, this is also
unbelievably useful right?

247
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,660
Because you say, well I'm assuming my
parameters are non negative.

248
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,260
Why?

249
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,280
Because I think that the greater this
feature is.

250
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,490
I have prior knowledge saying that it must
be the case that the probability of

251
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,200
this classifier being one, should
increase, right.

252
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,680
That's a non negativity.

253
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,120
If some of those things turn out to be
zero,

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,020
with a large lagrange multiplier, that's
telling you something.

255
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,960
That's basically saying, guess what, if I,

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,490
if I could actually take that coefficient
negative.

257
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,360
I could get a way, I could really reduce
the the negative log likelihood.

258
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,300
Everybody see what I'm saying?

259
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,270
So, okay.

260
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,960
And you have solution methods that have
polynomial worst-case complexity theory.

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,150
That's with self-concordance and, and it
kind of varies, as you know,

262
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,215
between sort of the practical and the
theoretical analysis.

263
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:00,340
Okay.

264
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,210
Now, the practical consequences are
[COUGH] for medium scale problems,

265
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,980
you can solve a problem like 20 to 80
steps, roughly.

266
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,600
Right?
Each of

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,020
those steps is basically least squares
problem of the same size.

268
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,120
Right?
So, if you like, it's hilarious.

269
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,070
We've come all the way back to 1802 or

270
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,790
whatever it is and someone says, what are
you doing?

271
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,670
I'm solving a problem.

272
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,650
How are you doing it, least squares?

273
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,280
And you say, well actually 20 or 30.

274
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,730
I'm doing solving 30 of these squares
problems.

275
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,280
Right?
But in this case,

276
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,410
it's a, it's a different thing.

277
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,490
Instead of like, tweaking parameters and

278
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,190
tuning stuff in an ad hoc way, you
actually say what you want.

279
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,050
Like I want this thing to be positive.

280
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,770
I want this thing to be in that range.

281
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,210
And that tweaking of parameters is done in
a very sophisticated way.

282
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,140
Okay.
So I'll, I'll move on.

283
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,050
I should say that for people solving, you
know, much larger problems, and that's

284
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,540
basically anyone in machine learning,
interior point methods are, are not used.

285
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,260
They are, these are small things and, you
know, there's a whole

286
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,860
world of problems that, methods that can
be used in, in those regimes.

287
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,010
And, there, there's actually several
places where you can learn about that.

288
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,910
So.
Okay.

289
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,520
So let me say a little bit about you know,
how do you use it.

290
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,030
And this is just my idea and

291
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,068
it diff, actually it differs markedly from
some other people who actually.

292
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:18,448
Whose opinions I, very much respect, I'll
say a little bit what that is in a minute.

293
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:21,490
So, here's one idea, and it's, you know,

294
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,020
has to do with the kind of problems I
would look at, something like that.

295
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,040
But it goes like this.

296
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,750
The idea is you should use rapid
prototypes in

297
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,140
approximate modelling, right.

298
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,924
You start with simple models, small
problem instances and

299
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,650
some inefficient solution method.

300
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,550
And you see.

301
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,840
If it's promising.

302
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
If it's not promising, then there's no
need for

303
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,750
you to worry about how to scale it.

304
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,080
I mean, that's actually in a way, that's a
good, that's a good outcome.

305
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,690
Right?
Because you don't have

306
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,660
to worry about scaling it.

307
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,200
You can always do things like work out and
simplify and

308
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,320
interpret the optimality conditions and,
and,

309
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,200
and give an interpretation of the dual.

310
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,700
That's always interesting.

311
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,640
At the least.

312
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,790
And sometimes even useful.

313
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,840
Another thing although we didn't, we
talked only a little bit about it.

314
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,160
We had a few problems involving integer,
variables and things like that and

315
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,570
there were hints of this.

316
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,050
But my feeling is you should first learn
convex optimization.

317
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,860
Once you're fully certified in convex
optimization which you

318
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,500
will all be by the end of this coming
weekend.

319
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,272
But once you're fully certified.

320
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,060
Then it's okay.

321
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,160
Then you get more relaxed about it, and in
fact you can solve lot,

322
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,660
there's lots of non convex problems.

323
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,500
You can, you can solve extremely
effectively knowing these tools so

324
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,280
I should say a little bit about this.

325
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,910
So, this is actually quite, this idea, if
you start with small simple models and

326
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,020
then ramp up, that's very different than
for example, what people do with Google.

327
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,900
Right?
So, there,

328
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,830
they have this big deal which is
youprototype@scale.

329
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,800
You don't write some little, tiny thing
and, you know,

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,410
on your laptop or something.

331
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,500
It's like the first thing you write.

332
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,320
Runs on a data center.

333
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,140
Okay, and the, and the argument for that
and I think it's actually correct is a lot

334
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,590
of things they're looking for don't emerge
until you get to scale, right?

335
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,410
And in that case of course it's completely
correct.

336
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,460
You don't sit around and type something
into CVX and say, oh hey look at this, and

337
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,020
then say, oh now all I have to do is map
it to I mean not to mention, Matlab and

338
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,300
CBX are not real things.

339
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,610
But but even the analog of that, so, so
there, that makes perfect sense.

340
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,110
And I think that's just a different set of
applications and stuff like that.

341
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,230
And I respect that as well.

342
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,950
But just so you know, that this seems very
obvious, but

343
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,890
there's plenty of people who completely
reject it, and I think.

344
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,890
For what they want to do.

345
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,120
Completely correctly.

346
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,870
So.

347
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,280
Okay.

348
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,530
So I'll say a little bit about a few
things and then we'll I'll just wrap up.

349
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,880
so, things we didn't' cover are, you know,
methods for large scale problems.

350
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,340
Right?
And there are tons of these.

351
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,710
These will be covered in EE364B.

352
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,170
Related to that is, is, is a whole,
there's a whole set of mathematics we did

353
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,290
not cover, which is sub gradient analysis
and, and, and a bunch of convex analysis.

354
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,620
And these are, these are related.

355
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,670
Actually these are all related and

356
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,200
in fact so is this distributed convex
optimization, right, so, how do

357
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,225
you solve these problems on you know,
distributed machines and things like that?
