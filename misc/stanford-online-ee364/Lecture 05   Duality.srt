1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,480
So the next topic is duality.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,570
It's a whole world.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,456
It's an absolutely beautiful subject, it's
you can think of it in many, many,

4
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:09,439
different ways.

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,959
it's, one way to way to think of it is
it's a way to,

6
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:16,720
it's an organized way to form highly
nontrivial bounds.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,960
On optimization problems.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,300
And we'll see that that's one of its
beauties.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,298
Even for hard problems, not necessarily
convex.

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:27,330
We'll also see that it, it's a, it's a,
it's for convex optimization problems is

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,626
a beautiful theory that will lead to
things like,

12
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:33,714
optimality conditions, that give you that
in a few, handful of cases, you can solve,

13
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,522
but always will give you insight into how
a convex optimization problem works, or

14
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:42,782
what the solution's going to look like.

15
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:46,556
And finally, we'll see that it, it, you
can interpret the,

16
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:51,958
some results from duality, as giving you a
sensitivity of the optimization problem

17
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:58,496
to perturbation and sensitivity analysis
of various things.

18
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:00,108
We'll look at a bunch of examples, and

19
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:03,320
we'll con-, extend this to generalized
inequalities.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
That'll be the last thing.

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,972
That will do in, in this section.

22
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,888
I should say something else about it, it's
it's all, it's all,

23
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:15,398
it's, I mean of course a lot of it is just
theory and it's absolutly beutiful and

24
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,530
it's, a lot of the theory works even when
the problems involved are not

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,040
convex the differences when they're not
convex you can't actually Do it in

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,840
a sense because you're actually asked to
minimize various things.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,241
And roughly speaking you can't do that
unless the problem,

28
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,660
the functions involved are convex.

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,720
So what's very interesting about duality
is that it becomes,

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,920
although it's interesting theoretically
always, it actually becomes.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,460
Actionable in the case of convex
optimization.

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,620
So it'll, it's actually, you can do it,
you get numbers and

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,260
they have beautiful interpretations and so
on.

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,410
So, that's the idea.

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,222
Beautiful subject.

36
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,628
Alright, so we'll start.

37
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:58,664
And for a while I should say, we're just
going to be defining various things and

38
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:01,838
going very slowly but you'll see actually
even after just a few pages we're going to

39
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:06,790
end up with something that's actually
highly nontrivial and interesting.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,619
So, let's start.

41
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,051
So I'm going to start with a standard form
problem and

42
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:15,930
I'm going to not assume it's convex now.

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,674
So, I minimize an objective subject to
inequality constraints and

44
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:20,970
equality constraints.

45
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,625
And I'm going to form a Lagrangian and the
Lagrangian is this.

46
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:29,345
I'm going to form, I"m going to add to the
objective a sum of the lambda is

47
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:34,345
are going to be non negative numbers here.

48
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:36,664
I'll, I'll get to that in a minute.

49
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:39,888
Multiples of the object, of the constraint
functions here and

50
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,869
I'm going to add some other numbers.

51
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:46,055
These are going to be unconstrained new
i's.

52
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm going to, that's going to multiply.

53
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,890
H i of x you should think as a residual.

54
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,810
It's the amount.

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,740
If it's 0, that perfect, that means you've
satisfied that constraint.

56
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,994
Otherwise, it's a residual.

57
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,690
So that's the idea.

58
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,380
That's the Lagrangian, and it's a function
of both x and these things.

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,667
One way, nice way to interpret the lambda
and nu Vectors.

60
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,490
Is if, you like, you could think of them
as prices, right.

61
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,366
So, for example, F0 of X lets assume
that's in dollars, F1 of X,

62
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:17,730
well, I don't know what it is but its in
some units.

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,260
And Lambda 1 is the price in dollars per
that unit.

64
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,270
So.

65
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,771
If this were zero eh, lambda 1 f1 would be
zero, and

66
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,520
there'd be no payment either way.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,723
But notice also that is f is positive, it
would cost you.

68
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,242
So, it costs you to have positive f.

69
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:40,590
Now, in the original semantics, the cost
of having positive f1 is very simple.

70
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,608
It's plus infinity.

71
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:47,950
So in this, with, with this Largrangian
here, the cost is actually, its linear.

72
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not something that goes from 0 to
infinite.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,585
Okay.

74
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:56,941
And these are called dual variables for
reasons that will become clear later or

75
00:03:56,941 --> 00:04:00,910
they're called Lagrange Multipliers.

76
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,760
And we'll call them lambda for the
inequalities nu for the equalities.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,536
Okay, so this is simply the Lagrange unit.

78
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,143
Now the Lagrange dual function is this,

79
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:15,940
it says it's a function only of lambda and
nu.

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,325
And it says you should minimize Over x,
the lagrangian of x lambda nu.

81
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:26,936
And, if you like to think of it this way,
it's the infimum, of, of,

82
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:30,630
well that's the lagrangian.

83
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,580
And one interpretation of it is very nice,
it's this.

84
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,640
You could say that's the optimal cost with
the prices given by lambda i and new i.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,382
Right?
So if, and

86
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,789
some people make a big story about it.

87
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,561
We'll see this later, but, you know, they
think of

88
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:51,890
they think of this as sort of a market
solution or something like that.

89
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,746
That instead of strictly enforcing fi less
than 0,

90
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:58,610
instead you simply set a price lambda i.

91
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,118
And instead of saying oh, you know, h i of
x should be 0,

92
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,550
I'll just put a price new i.

93
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,880
And then this says that you should
minimize x over this.

94
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,545
And so this is the optimal cost under the
prices or

95
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:14,825
Lagrange multiplier vectors, you know,
lambda and new.

96
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:17,902
Okay, very important fact about g.

97
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,280
That's this.

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,870
It is concave, even if the original
problem is non-convex.

99
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,958
And let's see why.

100
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,702
Here's the Lagrangian here, and as a
function of Lambda and Nu,

101
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:33,816
it is affine, period, for any x it's
affine.

102
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:40,183
Okay, now the enfemum over any family of
affine functions is concave.

103
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,299
So That, right?

104
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,855
So, now of course it can be minus infinity
for some lambda and nu.

105
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:46,100
Okay?

106
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,550
That's, that's, it's an [UNKNOWN].

107
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,752
Of course it can be unbounded.

108
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:49,892
Okay.

109
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,725
Now here's something that's going to be
kind of obvious.

110
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:55,730
It's going to lead to really interesting
results though.

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,062
It's this, suppose I told you that the,
that the Lagrange multipliers associated

112
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:02,520
with inequality constraints are
non-negative.

113
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,389
Then the claim is, the dual function
evaluated at Lambda and Nu,

114
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,250
is a lower bound on P star.

115
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,530
That's the optimal value of the original
problem.

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,350
Okay.

117
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,270
Well, look at the proof.

118
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,630
It's embarrassingly simple, it just says
this,

119
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,680
it says suppose X tilde is any feasible
point.

120
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,002
And let's assume that the Lagrange
multipliers associated with

121
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:26,895
the inequality constraints are non
negative that's here.

122
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:30,255
Then it says the following f 0 of x that,

123
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:37,066
that's bigger than this and I'll explain
why in a minute.

124
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:41,554
And this thing i mean by definition if you
minimize over x if that's smaller than

125
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:45,498
this value but that's g and this one here
this one follows from the most

126
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:50,054
embarrassingly simple thing it says the
following,it says take cap zero of x and

127
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:53,726
if these are non-negative If x is
feasable, these are less than or

128
00:06:53,726 --> 00:07:02,800
equal to zero, and now we're going to use
the deep mathemetical result.

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,750
That the product of a non-negative number
and a non-positive is non-positive.

130
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,190
We'll use another deep result that says,
the sum of,

131
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,040
in this case non-positive numbers is
non-positive.

132
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,510
So this whole thing here is less than or
equal to zero.

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,416
Now, it doesn't matter what the new i's
are,

134
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,940
because if x is feasible, these are all
zero.

135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
And the product of zero and any number is
zero.

136
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,750
So this whole term is zero.

137
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,250
And that says that whatever this is, when
x, for any x L of,

138
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,740
if x is feasible, then L of x lambda nu is
less than f 0 of x.

139
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,450
For any feasible.

140
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,916
And that by [INAUDIBLE] over x, I get
this.

141
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay?

142
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,150
So, what this says is actually really
interesting.

143
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,414
It says this dual function, whatever it is
You can think of it as

144
00:07:53,414 --> 00:08:00,601
providing a parametrized lower bound on
the optimal value of the problem.

145
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:01,319
Right?
And

146
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,123
the parama, it's parametrized by lamda and
new.

147
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:08,489
Now, they can all be crappy lower bound
for example, you can plug in lamda and

148
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:13,890
new in G of lamda new could be minus
infinite that's the universal lower bound.

149
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,145
In other words, I don't have to know
anything about your problem to

150
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,290
say minus infinity is the lower bound.

151
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,490
It's the completely and utterly
uninformative lower bound.

152
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,060
So, you get lower bounds nd they're
parameterized by lambda and nu.

153
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,184
By, by the way, that alone is quite
interesting.

154
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:36,444
By the way, one thing that you're, you'll
be tempted to do immediately is this.

155
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:40,210
If I have a lower bound, it's opt, it's
paramatized by some parameters.

156
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,580
You should have the urge to change those
parameters so as to maximize the lower

157
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,160
bound because as you maximized the lower
bound it becomes better right?

158
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,005
If I tell you here's a lower bound that's
minus 12,

159
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,575
if I can get another lower bound that's
minus 10.5, that's better.

160
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,460
So you should want to maximize the lower
bound.

161
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,460
That's quite interesting cause guess what
that function is concave.

162
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,500
Maximizing the lower bound is going to be
a convex optimization problem right.

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,105
So that's very interesting.

164
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,835
Okay let's look at some examples.

165
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:18,508
Let's solve, let's minimize x transpose x
subject to ax equals b.

166
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:21,154
Well, the Lagrangian is we take the
objective, and

167
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:24,630
to that we add nu transpose times Ax minus
b.

168
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,340
That's the residual.

169
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,417
And what we're going to do is we're
going to minimize that over x.

170
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,610
That's easy enough.

171
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,090
It's you can work out what the sol, I
mean, you just take the gradient and

172
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,930
set it equal to 0, and you get that.

173
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,580
And you plug that in to this lagrangian
here and you get the following.

174
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,930
You get that.

175
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,030
It is a negative it's a concave quadratic
function.

176
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,955
That's what it is.

177
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,250
Okay.

178
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,082
I mean by the way it had to be concave
because the dual function is always

179
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:56,104
concave but here we see it explisitly and
that says the following.

180
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:59,954
[COUGH] This says, if you picked, if you
want to solve this problem,

181
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:06,850
this says it's the least, it's the least
norm squared solution of ax equals b.

182
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,214
That says if you picked any value of, any
vector at all, any vector, and

183
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:13,868
you evaluate this quadratic function here
That number is bigger than is le,

184
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:18,290
is a lower bound than the optimal value
here.

185
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,240
Okay?

186
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, that's not so useful here because we
can solve this problem exactly.

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,019
Well, that's not entirely true I'll give
an example.

188
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,780
When x has size let's say 100 million this
could actually be a challenge to solve and

189
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,713
you might use some kind of by using some
kind of integrate method,

190
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:41,129
in the integrate method after some number
of iterations it have an x and if you

191
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,407
are lucky it will have ax equals b, and
you could look at the value of this and

192
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:50,030
supposedly you find that is 7.1 lets just
say ok,now enough to be able to identify

193
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,446
a new evaluate this number, and find out
that the value of that, if that number

194
00:10:54,446 --> 00:11:04,100
evaluates to 7.0, you are super lucky.

195
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,445
Because now you've decide, you've shown,

196
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:10,925
you have an x that achieves enough, an
objective value 7.1.

197
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:15,158
But your new is a certificate proving that
the best X has to be,

198
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:18,146
has to have a value of this worse than 7.0
And

199
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:26,390
that says you're pretty close to optimum
and you can quit with confidence.

200
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,899
Right.
You can quit saying that,

201
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,870
at worst you're 0.1 optimal.

202
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,930
Sub optimal.

203
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,338
We'll talk about these ideas later but

204
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:35,085
I'm just saying this has practical
applications like.

205
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,549
Immediately.

206
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,950
By the way you could ask a reasonable
question.

207
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,323
How would you choose this new?

208
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:43,638
Great question of course it's a lower
bound no matter what new you pick but,

209
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:47,738
if you pick a crappy new you're going to
get a crappy lower bound.

210
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:51,310
So, we're going to answer those questions
as, as we move on.

211
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,940
But, for now it's just a lower bound
depends on a new Any number you,

212
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,390
any vector nu you plug in and evaluate
that you get a lower value.

213
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,380
Let's look at LP.

214
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,740
I want to minimize c transpose x, subject
x equals b and x non negative, so

215
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,940
here's the Lagrangian.

216
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,382
It's the objective, plus I take...

217
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:16,730
The, here I take a, a new transpose,
that's the dual vector times a x minus b.

218
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,458
And here I'm going to write this x less
than, or

219
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,980
x bigger than equal to zero as this thing.

220
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,770
Minus x is less than 0.

221
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,600
And so I get minus lambda transpose x.

222
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,440
That's the Lagrange multiplier term.

223
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,680
And so I get this, and You look at that
Lagrangian and its affine, in x.

224
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,758
Well of course it was going to be a, its
going to be affine because every

225
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:40,235
function involved in a linear program is a
affine is an affine objective,

226
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,971
affine inequality constraints and all you
do in lagrang,

227
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:49,120
following a lagrangian is you form a
waited linear combination of.

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,954
the adjective in the constrains,so you
gets to know is alpine and

229
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:57,498
now we rest is minimize alpine function
well that's actually quiet easy to do

230
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:02,255
right,if you minimize an alpine function
,basically for most cases you just get

231
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:06,728
minus infinity if this vector here is non
zero i can make this thing small as i

232
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:15,500
like go in the direction negative And
multiply by a big number.

233
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,790
I can make, I, I get this is unbounded
below.

234
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,778
So if I take the infimum of this affine
function, I get minus infinity,

235
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,259
almost always.

236
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,276
Except if this, this thing here, is 0.

237
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,450
If that's 0, L is quite boring.

238
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,240
It's constant.

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
It's minus b transpose nu.

240
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,885
So I get a weird function g.

241
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:37,810
It looks like this.

242
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,220
It's minus b transpose nu, if this holds.

243
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,690
Otherwise it's minus infinity.

244
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,858
So, what it says is,

245
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:49,350
I have a parameterized lower bound on the
optimal value of the cell b.

246
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,195
It's parameterized by a vector nu, and
lambda.

247
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:57,475
Now, If, the fol, if Mu and Lambda don't
satisfy this equality constraint, then

248
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:04,920
my lower bound is minus infinity which a
completely uninformative lower bound.

249
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,392
But if they satisfy this constraint, I can
announce minus B transpose new,

250
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,160
is a lower bound.

251
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,276
On this, on this, LP.

252
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:14,107
Right?

253
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:17,755
So, for example, if I could find, if I
were lucky enough to find a nu and

254
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:21,787
a lambda that satisfies this, and minus b
transpose nu equals c transpose x,

255
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:26,850
I would be done, and I would absolutely
know it.

256
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,610
I'd know it, because I have a point that's
feasible.

257
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,040
Achieves a certain objective value.

258
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,270
And I have a lower bound showing that that
objective value is optimal, right?

259
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,156
So, I'm getting ahead of myself but this
is, this is the,

260
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:42,630
this is where we're going with all of
this, the practical applications.

261
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,735
So what does this mean, to say there
exists a lambda for

262
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:50,015
which A transpose nu minus lambda plus c
is zero.

263
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:55,166
That's the same as saying a transpose new
plus c is bigger than equal to 0.

264
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,165
because you just take the negative of that
to be lambda.

265
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,460
Sorry, that's equal to lambda.

266
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,680
And so what it says is this.

267
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,405
It says that if you have this l p here,
and it says that if you find a vector new,

268
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:13,710
That satisfies a transpose nu plus c is
bigger than equal to 0.

269
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,440
Now, at the moment, we don't know how to
find such a vector.

270
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,280
We have no idea.

271
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,930
We're going to see later how to find such
a vector.

272
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,160
But right now, we're, we, we don't concern
ourselves with how we find it.

273
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,815
If you find a vector nu for which a
transpose nu plus c is

274
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:31,525
bigger than equal to 0, then this number,
minus b transpose nu, is a lower bound.

275
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:35,420
On the outcome value of that standard form
LP, okay?

276
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,200
So that's the idea and, you know, if, if
this is a real duality,

277
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,460
a really Lagrange duality, you know, it's
not hard to show.

278
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,700
You can show this directly although,

279
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,155
if you didn't know about Lagrangian, you
might not have guessed such a thing.

280
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,460
Okay.

281
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,500
Let's look at equality constrained norm
minimization.

282
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,435
We already looked at one that was kind of
like this but

283
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,450
not quite because we squared it.

284
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,780
So let's minimize norm x, norm is a
generic norm subject to ax equals b.

285
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,036
Well, the duel function is the infimum of
the norm of x

286
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:10,592
minus new transpose ax minus b, that's
this here.

287
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:15,600
And here, we're going to infamize this
over x.

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,410
Now here, that's the norm minus a linear
function.

289
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,470
Well the norm minus a linear function, we
have to see if that's, you know,

290
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,670
we have to minimize over x.

291
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,855
That's a homogeneous function, so the only
possible things that can happen is

292
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,580
you either get zero Or you get minus
infinity when I minimize.

293
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,508
And in fact, I get zero if and only if the
dual norm [COUGH] of a transpose new is

294
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:43,520
less than or equal to one, so that, that's
this term.

295
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,695
Okay?
alright, so

296
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:48,020
now I have a beautiful lower bound
property.

297
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,310
It says if you want to do general norm
minimization with equality constraints,

298
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,365
it says the following, if you're solving
that problem or

299
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:58,745
whatever you care about, it says if you
can find a vector new for

300
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:02,515
which a transpose new in dual norm is less
than one That tells you that b

301
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:10,410
transposed new is a lower bound on the
optimal value here, okay.

302
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,450
So, so I think you can see here where what
we're doing is we're generating

303
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:23,050
parameterized lower bounds on the optimal
value Of an optimization problem.

304
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,380
I mean, that's kind of what this is.

305
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,998
We have not yet said anything about how do
you optimize that parameter, you know,

306
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:30,200
anything else like that.

307
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
We, you know, how tight is lower bound.

308
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,045
We're going to get to all these things,
but for the moment, that's the correct way

309
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:40,080
to think of this, what we've done of
Lagrange duality so far.

310
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,920
Okay.
Now, our last example of this is actually

311
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,882
one where it's quite interesting.

312
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:54,102
It's a nonconvex problem, so let's take a
look at that.

313
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:55,030
Here it is.

314
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,462
You'll recall that the partitioning, part
two of the partitioning problem is I

315
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:02,430
have n items and I'm going to partition
them into two groups.

316
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,940
Right?

317
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,200
And I'm going to encode the partitioning
by taking a vector x On our end.

318
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,184
And the entries are really going to be
plus 1 or minus 1.

319
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,570
Plus 1 means one group, minus 1 means the
other, right?

320
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,370
So, a plus minus 1 vector corresponds to a
partitioning of these x into two groups.

321
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,626
And I have a matrix w that tells you how
irritating it is for x i and

322
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:27,460
x j to be in the same partition.

323
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,196
And that's given by w i j.

324
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:34,404
And so, this is so W i j, I guess you
could say is, that's, that's how much,

325
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:41,560
you know, let's say person i hates person
j, let's say, dislikes.

326
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,290
Let's not use hate.

327
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,500
Dislikes person j.

328
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,320
That, that would be for a constraint, so
dislikes.

329
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,439
And so this says and then if they're in
the same.

330
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,102
partition, right?

331
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:51,791
Then, you know, this is of course sum
xixjwij.

332
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,735
And if they're in the same partition then
they're both either plus 1 or

333
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,040
minus 1, [COUGH], and you add wij.

334
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,030
If they're in different partitions xi and
xj,

335
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,960
the product is minus 1, and you actually
subtract them, wij, right?

336
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,580
So, so this says something like,

337
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,976
you know Partition into two groups in the
most harmonious way.

338
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:17,922
Okay.

339
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:23,710
Now, that problem you may, you may know,
we've already seen it.

340
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,270
That's actually m p hard.

341
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,941
So that is as hard as many other
combinatorial optimizational problems.

342
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:34,697
No one knows how to solve this thing,
exactly.

343
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,146
And quickly.

344
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,760
So it's a complicated problem.

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,848
By the way, there are many, many methods
to solve to solve this approximately and

346
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,433
in fact, we're going to see some,
momentarily.

347
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,850
And it's a prac, it's a problem that comes
up all the time.

348
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,005
Right, so for example okay, we, we'll move
on.

349
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:59,157
so, that's a nonconvex function because
these constraints are not

350
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:06,410
remotely convex, right, that's a quadratic
equality constraint.

351
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,450
By the way this relaxation That's gone
vex.

352
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,189
And that's a very famous relaxation of
this problem, and

353
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:14,838
I think we've seen it before.

354
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,286
however, what we're going to do now is
we're going to take this,

355
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:20,244
by the way there's also no reason to leave
the w well it's symmetric because

356
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:24,680
there's no reason to believe it's positive
semi-definite.

357
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,728
Okay, so here's what we're going to do.

358
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:30,090
We're going to take, we're simply going to
follow the rules.

359
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,941
You take f zero and to that you add sum of
new i times, these are h i, of x,

360
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:38,860
and that's these quadratics.

361
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,400
And if you look at what this is, it's a
quadratic plus a Constant, constant n x.

362
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,100
Well it's a quadratic how do you minimize
a quadratic?

363
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,956
It's very simple minimal of a quadratic is
either minus infinity if

364
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:55,600
it's got a negative [INAUDIBLE] value or
it's 0 if it's positive semi definite.

365
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,656
So what you get is the dual function is
either minus infinity or

366
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,790
If this matrix is positive semi-definite,
the best x you can do,

367
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:09,740
I mean the x that minimizes this, is x
equals zero.

368
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,640
And then you just get this thing left
over.

369
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
You get that.

370
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,160
And that happens if that's true.

371
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,821
And that says, we have the following
statement.

372
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:25,247
If you can find A new, such that w plus
diag of new is bigger than equal to zero,

373
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:33,205
then minus one transposed new is a lower
bound on p star.

374
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:34,630
Okay?

375
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,904
That's incredible.

376
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,420
It's quite sophisticated.

377
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,980
It says that, by the way, that's an LMI in
new.

378
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,660
That's a linear matrix inequality.

379
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,790
It says that if this matrix inequality
holds Then you get a lower bound, okay.

380
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,660
It's quite interesting.

381
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,076
For example, here's one, you take nu is
minus lambda min of w times all of ones,

382
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,250
and you get a very famous bound for this
problem which is

383
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:05,750
this: the optimal value is bigger than
equal to n time lambda min of w, okay.

384
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,186
And I'm going to show you another way to
derive that.

385
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,210
Another way to derive this inequality,
very famous inequality,

386
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,242
by the way it's also, it suggests a method
for approximately solving this problem,

387
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:19,106
which is actually called [UNKNOWN] well in
this case it's spectral partition, but

388
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,002
let me say a little,

389
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:26,870
let me derive this another method that's
maybe simpler than [UNKNOWN] 's duality.

390
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,350
It goes like this...

391
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,610
You want to solve this problem.

392
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,840
If you cannot it's, I mean it's too hard.

393
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,177
So you look at it, and you say, you know
what though, if x i squared is 1,

394
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:37,675
I'll tell you one thing I know for sure.

395
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:40,220
Some x i squared is n.

396
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,354
Okay, because each of the numbers is 1.

397
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:44,690
Okay?

398
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:51,352
And that says so These n inequalities
imply that inequality.

399
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay?

400
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,570
That's one way to say it.

401
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,121
Or, if you like to think geometrically,

402
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,270
these inequalities say that xi sits on a
hyper, the vertex.

403
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,840
It's on the vertex of a hypercube.

404
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,985
So, there's a cube in rn with entry, the,

405
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:10,490
the extreme, the vertices there are
Boolean vectors, right?

406
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,658
That's the hypercube.

407
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:19,464
Then, interestingly, this is the sphere
that covers the hyper cube, okay.

408
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,990
So, so you can think of it as a
relaxation.

409
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,247
It says that if you're in the hyper, if
you're on the vertex of a hyper cube,

410
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,706
you're in the sphere.

411
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,640
But you know what?

412
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,664
I know how to minimize a quadric, an
arbitrary.

413
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:34,284
Quadratic fun, form.

414
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:37,920
x transposed, Wx, subject to this.

415
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,460
Because it, it's simple.

416
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,670
That's, that's one of these non-convex
problems we can actually solve.

417
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,910
If I say, what's the minimum of a
quadratic form,

418
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,610
subject to the norm being 1, (no period)
The answer is, it's lamdamin ??

419
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,230
of w.

420
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,022
And you take x,

421
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:57,193
by the way, to be an igan vector,
associated with the minimum igan value.

422
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:59,843
And so, here, the sum of the square, the
norm squared, is n, so

423
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:03,500
that scales everything up by n and you get
this bound.

424
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,680
You get the same bound.

425
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,810
It's a beautiful bound.

426
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,310
By the way, it also suggests.

427
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,470
A good idea for x.

428
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,120
Know, tell you what it is right now.

429
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,338
You compute the minimum,

430
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:18,060
the eigenvector of W associated with its
minimum eigenvalue.

431
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,815
That's the first step.

432
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:21,600
And you get, and let's call that vector V.

433
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,111
Then you simply take Xi is the sine of (no
period) v.

434
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:29,379
Done.

435
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:30,970
Right?

436
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,410
That does quite well.

437
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,219
When you think of this as a partioning
probelem, that's called,

438
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:38,510
this is called spectral partitioning in
this case.

439
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,590
Well, that's one name for it,

440
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,470
although that name is used to refer to
something similar but not the same, but

441
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,170
that's the idea.

442
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,061
So the point here, let me sum up what the
point of this is.

443
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:50,560
This is a hard problem right?

444
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,490
If w is 1000 by 1000, I, I don't know if I
give you 1000 by 1000 sparse w and

445
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:01,400
I say solve the two way partitioning
problem.

446
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,830
It's not, it's not unreasonable to say the
following, you can't solve that problem,

447
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,875
you can't tell me what the global minimum
is.

448
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,280
Okay.

449
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,612
What this says is, the following, it says
you can get a lower bound, you have

450
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:23,075
to exhibit a vector new, check that this
matrix here is a positive semi definite.

451
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:28,810
If it is, minus 1 transpose nu is a lower
bound of an optimal value.

452
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,960
Now in this case, this is exceedingly
valuable, exceedingly valuable.

453
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,270
Because for example you could do spectral
partitioning.

454
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,980
You could start with this one.

455
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,030
And you could observe that it gets good
results.

456
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,160
By the way, after you do this, you could
do something like a greedy heuristic.

457
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,318
i would do it once you find bit
vector,Boolean vector all this x's

458
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:54,091
are plus and minus 1 here why would you
not do the following i

459
00:25:54,091 --> 00:25:57,864
would cycle through x and for the each x i
,i would flip it and

460
00:25:57,864 --> 00:26:05,360
see it if it gets better Most of the time,
it doesn't.

461
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,260
But if it ever gets better, I take it, and
that's my new X.

462
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,290
And I keep running through my data until
this stops.

463
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,040
And then, when I stop, I think that's
called something like, 1 opt,

464
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,280
in combinatorial optimization.

465
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,335
What that means is, I can't change one of
my variables and

466
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:21,960
improve the objective, okay?

467
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,310
So that's one opt.

468
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,680
It just means it's a kind of local
optimality, it doesn't mean.

469
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,860
You're at the optimal point.

470
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,724
So the point is then method I just
mentioned spectral partitioning followed

471
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,940
by a local optimization.

472
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,680
a greedy local optimatization.

473
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,190
I can implement that for a matrix w which
is 50,000 by 50,000.

474
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,940
Actually I can scale it as big as you want
and people do.

475
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,060
And you will get exceedingly good
partitions Okay.

476
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,960
The question will be, how do you know it's
good?

477
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,470
And the answer might be, although like I
haven't said yet how you would find it,

478
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,490
you do the following.

479
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,502
You would exhibit a new, demonstrate the W
plus diag of new is big and equal to zero,

480
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:06,396
and if that's true you can simply assert
That the optimal value of this problem,

481
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:10,290
whatever it may be, which no one knows,
it's bigger than this, and if that number

482
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,243
is close to this number that you got by
your heuristic method it's your lucky day,

483
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:18,078
because now you know that although your
method was heuristic, on that problem

484
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:21,913
instance you were lucky and you actually
solved the problem either exactly or

485
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:30,591
to some precision, alright, so that's the
idea...

486
00:27:30,591 --> 00:27:33,859
Okay yeah [COUGH] in general there's a
strong

487
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,580
connection between the Lagrange dual and
the idea of a conjugate.

488
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,334
So, let's see how that works.

489
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,782
If you minimize f0 subject to Ax less than
b,

490
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:47,518
linear equality and inequality
constraints.

491
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:50,326
You formula Lagrangian, but because all
the constraints are,

492
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:53,782
involve linear functions, you're adding a
linear function to an objective,

493
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:57,670
to a function, and you're minimizing.

494
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,750
But, we have a name for that.

495
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,200
That's called the conjugate function,
right.

496
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,711
Because the conjugate function.

497
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:08,216
Minimizes rough, it minimizes f of x minus
a linear function of x, right.

498
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:12,952
I mean okay it maximizes y transpose x
minus fx, it's the same thing, so that's

499
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:20,370
the conjugate, and what that says is
there's just a little formula for the...

500
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,270
The dual function of a linear of a problem
with linear equality constraints is

501
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,230
very simple formula it's just this minus f
0 star of minus A transpose new minus C

502
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,960
transpose new and then with this linear
part.

503
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,194
Now, you have to be very careful turning
this around with all the minus signs and

504
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:39,284
so on but this is probably correct.

505
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,836
And if it's not, then it's close, but one
minus sign or

506
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,552
something off, but that's it.

507
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:48,200
so, don't recommend this because it's
better, I mean, I personally,

508
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,168
I derive dual functions by hand every time
because it's good exercise, and

509
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:57,200
it's just as hard to use some forumla like
this one.

510
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,623
But let's do one.

511
00:28:58,623 --> 00:29:02,240
Let's do entropy maximization.

512
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,595
So here I want to minimize negative
entropy subject to some equality and

513
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:11,700
inequality constraints.

514
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,649
Well, that's a,

515
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:18,025
the, the dual, the conjugate of that is
actually some exponentials.

516
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:25,252
That's beautiful because it'll it'll allow
me to get the conjugate like immediately.

517
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:29,028
And so the original problem I had to solve
is linearly constrained with

518
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:33,163
inequalities and equalities entropy
maximization.

519
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:37,190
I can get a a dual function and it's going
to involve exponentials.

520
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,809
That's quite interesting.

521
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,290
We get to what's called the dual problem.

522
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,475
Now we've been hinting at this for a while
and it kind of makes sense.

523
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:53,870
If you think of g of lambda and nu as a
lower bound on p star, right?

524
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,430
If, if it looks like, if that's your
interest and

525
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:04,459
interpretation of what the dual function
is [UNKNOWN] new parameters.

526
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:07,679
Then, then you're interested in getting a
lower bound p star than obviously you'd be

527
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,405
interested in getting the best lower
bound.

528
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:13,560
So, that's the so called Lagrange dual
problem.

529
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,726
It says maximize this lower bound g of
land and

530
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,949
new, subject to the land is bigger than
zero and

531
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:23,368
you need that constraint there because
otherwise that's not a lower bound.

532
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:24,396
Okay?

533
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:27,750
So and you can interpret this problem this
way.

534
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,000
It's, it's finding the best lower bound
based on Lagrange duality.

535
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,320
And by the way, there's no reason for you
to believe at the moment, that it's good.

536
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,846
I mean, but it's just the best lower bound
you can find by the Lagrange duality.

537
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:44,926
we are going to call optimal value of this
d star and

538
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,853
we obviously have p star bigger than or
equal to d star right so

539
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:53,935
we will see more about these two numbers
shortly ,ok,lot of times people will do

540
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:59,094
little bit of transformation for example
If you have an LP, you form its dual, and

541
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:02,559
its dual is really this, it's maximize g
of lambda new,

542
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:11,690
subject to lambda bigger than or equal to
zero.

543
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,820
But [UNKNOWN] the g is most of the time
minus infinity.

544
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,592
So if you make those implicit constraints
explicit,

545
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:20,060
you get something that looks like that,
right.

546
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,656
And so, although it's not quite right to
say, this is,

547
00:31:22,656 --> 00:31:26,972
people would say, this is the Lagrange
dual of that problem.

548
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:31,188
ok,by the way we can interpret it
beautiful way someone says what does that

549
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:34,452
mean and you could say i can tell you what
it means it says if

550
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:38,940
you find a point new is feasible for this
problem it says this objective value is

551
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,330
lower bound on what the optimal problem
That's what that says.

552
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,300
It's quite interesting, right?

553
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,270
Then they say well what is this
optimization problem,

554
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,230
you say oh it's simple That says, pleas
find the best lower bound on this,

555
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:01,272
on this problem obtained by this method
which is Lagrange duality.

556
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:07,190
Now, you always have d star is less than p
star, always.

557
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,460
Oh, notice that in principle, d star is
computable.

558
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:18,034
d star is computable because you're
maximizing a concave function.

559
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,580
Now You can't always maximize a concave
function.

560
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,330
You have to be able to evaluate it and
things like that, and so

561
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,260
I want to be careful and not assert that
it always works.

562
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,816
But in many cases, you can.

563
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:34,626
Okay, now what this allows you to do is
you can find nontrivial lower bounds for

564
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,700
hard, difficult problems.

565
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,400
So for example, Let's go back to that two
way partitioning problem.

566
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,999
It says, if I solve this problem, that's a
semi-definite program.

567
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,268
That gives you a lower bound for the two
way partioning problem, okay.

568
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:53,330
And you will, it will not be equal to p
star.

569
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,180
But you'll get a number d star.

570
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,595
Which is less that P star and it's a
really,

571
00:32:57,595 --> 00:33:04,057
it's often a very good lower bound not
always but it's often quite good.

572
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,886
We'll maybe say more about that later.

573
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:14,080
Now strong duality says, what happens when
D star is P star, what does that mean?

574
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,486
What that says is.

575
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:23,660
That the lower bound on p star, obtained
by the Lagrange duality, is tight.

576
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,052
It says you have a parametrized lower
bound, but if you adjust the parameters

577
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:32,125
just right, the lower bound goes right up
to the, to the actual optimum value.

578
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,510
Okay?

579
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:40,340
And, in fact, by the way, people call p
star minus d star the duality gap.

580
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,390
We'll, we'll, we'll see more about this
later, but that's called the duality gap.

581
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,473
And so strong duality says there is no
duality gap.

582
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:49,084
Okay?
Now, by the way, for

583
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:54,255
a non-convex problem like this There's a,
there's a gap.

584
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:55,710
there's, there's a duality gap.

585
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,430
In this one, there is.

586
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,960
There had to be.

587
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,677
If there was no gap in this problem, then
this would constitute a proof that p

588
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:05,040
equals np, not that that's impossible, but
it just doesn't happen to

589
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,352
be the case at this moment or when this
was first observed.

590
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay, now,

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,270
in general, you don't have, there's no
reason to believe that d* is p*.

592
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,440
I mean that, there's no reason to believe
that.

593
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,564
But for convex problems, it usually holds.

594
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:23,050
Not always, right?

595
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,097
And de, you have to add extra conditions
to the problem (no period) To [COUGH] make

596
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:32,290
sure, you get d* equals p*, and these are
called constrain qualifications.

597
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,809
That's a, that's a historical term people
use.

598
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,280
And you add those.

599
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,282
You say, if the original problem is convex
and

600
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:45,056
blah, blah, blah, blah, then D star equals
P star.

601
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:47,828
Okay, so the sledgehammer of,

602
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:54,481
of the, of constraint qualifications is
Slater's constraint.

603
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:57,797
It's the only one we're going to look at,
but we'll look at a minor variation on it.

604
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:02,351
I mean there's entire courses, whole
semester long courses that do nothing but

605
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,720
look at constraint qualifications.

606
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,950
The whole course is a big glorified study
of when do you get p star equals d star?

607
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,690
And that's very interesting mathematics.

608
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,660
But the sledgehammer is Slater's
constraint and it's real simple.

609
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,596
It says this.

610
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:20,214
It says that if you take this convex, if
that problem is convex and

611
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:24,070
if there exists a strictly feasible point.

612
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,059
That merely means there's an x that
satisfies x equals b and

613
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:30,660
these, these inequalities hold strictly,
right?

614
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,148
If there is such a point that's slate,

615
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:35,260
that's as Slater's constraint
qualification holds.

616
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,320
And in that case, p star equals d star
period.

617
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,418
Okay?

618
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:43,932
Now it, supply, it suggests other things
as well, but, okay.

619
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:48,970
And by the way, there's tons of other
types of constraint qualifications.

620
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,040
They depend on things being affine,
non-affine, various things being bounded.

621
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,060
It goes on and on and on.

622
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,551
But that's, that's the idea.

623
00:35:55,551 --> 00:36:00,448
and i should say there is a variation on
this and its actually useful and

624
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:04,017
it says the following,it that for you can
exempt for

625
00:36:04,017 --> 00:36:09,578
linear inequalities from the requirement
of this later So in other words, if, if

626
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:19,480
you're the only inequalities that have to
hold strictly are the nonlinear ones.

627
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,265
And that's like a Slater, that's a, a
sharpened Slater's condition.

628
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,410
And that one is quite useful.

629
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,740
Let's look at inequality form LP.

630
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,570
There's the primal.

631
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,143
There's the dual.

632
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:37,191
There's the dual problem right here.

633
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:39,751
And okay, now the question is whether or
not the,

634
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:45,500
if I solve this problem, do I get the same
objective value as solving this one.

635
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,571
And Slater's condition says the following,

636
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:53,740
it says there should be a strictly
Feasible point here.

637
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:59,179
There should be an x with Ax still the
strictly less than b, okay.

638
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:02,550
Now in fact you can say more here.

639
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,875
The strengthened Slater's inequality says
all these inequalities are linear.

640
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:12,300
Therefore they are exempted from the
strictness requirement, and And

641
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,926
from the strengthened version, right?

642
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:22,050
From the strengthened latest condition the
only thing you have to satisfy is that.

643
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,380
And that says, that's the same as saying
the problem is feasible.

644
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,209
So the strengthened Slater's condition
says for

645
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:33,410
this inequality form LP if it is feasible
Then p star equals d star.

646
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,342
Okay.
Now it turns out, you get p star equals d

647
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:40,518
star even in cases where something is
infeasible around bound it, but

648
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:44,190
it can turn out for an inequality lp
there's one pathology and

649
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:52,310
you can actually have p star as plus
infinity and d star as minus infinity.

650
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,078
That can occur...

651
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:56,280
But all of these other ones cannot, right?

652
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,988
So, okay, so that's the that's, that's,

653
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:05,803
that's duality theory, the summary level
for LP.

654
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,300
Let's look at QP.

655
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,510
Let's minimize this quadratic function.

656
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,480
Let's make it strictly convex.

657
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,560
That's to make something, that's to make
minimizing Lagrangian easy.

658
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,655
[INAUDIBLE] linear inequalities.

659
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:22,850
here, we form the Lagrangian, that's this
thing.

660
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,510
So I take this, affine function, and I
rewrite it.

661
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,622
I augmented the objective with that and

662
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:32,118
I minimized, that's a quadratic function,
and

663
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:36,278
I get, I can work out exactly what it is,
I just set the derivative equal to zero,

664
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:43,530
I get 2px plus lan and I solve it and I
get that, which is a concave quadratic.

665
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,090
So the dual problem looks like that, ok?

666
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,660
Now Slater's condition says The basic
letter says you have to

667
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,950
have something that's a polyhedron.

668
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,010
This says there has to be a point in the
interior of the polyhedron.

669
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,432
Strength, if I strengthen this from the
strong version of Slater's condition,

670
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:03,410
it's simply this.

671
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,925
It says it has to be feasible.

672
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:09,110
So, that says that it's feasible, you get
p star equals d star.

673
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,020
But in fact, in this case, it's always the
case.

674
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,616
You always get p star equals d star, by
the way,

675
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:17,320
including the case when these two numbers
are plus or minus infinity, okay.

676
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,220
So in other words, the following is true.

677
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:25,712
If the optimal value of this is plus
infinity, right.

678
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,470
that would occur if for example it will
not occur for example it occurs if and

679
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,090
only if Ax<=b is infeasible that set of a
linear inequalities that is only if and

680
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,290
only if optimize this problem that's
interesting so that says this dual

681
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,420
problem is unbounded above when this
primal problem is infeasible and

682
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,830
that is super cool what is i mean to say
the dual problem is unbounded above it

683
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,540
says that you can make the dual objective
as large as you like but

684
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,180
the dual objective is always a lower bound
on the optimal wire i

685
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,660
can make it as large as i like you have to
have historicals So, it's got to be and

686
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,600
in this case you get perfect strong
duality all

687
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:13,546
the time.

688
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:17,950
Okay I'm going to mention one more.

689
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,488
I'm not going to go into the details.

690
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:23,860
This is handled in one of the appendices
in the book in much more detail.

691
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,956
This is an advanced topic.

692
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:30,330
But it's an, an interesting one so I'll
just talk About it.

693
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,364
You can have strong duality, p star equals
d star,

694
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,170
in cases where the problem is not convex.

695
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,400
So this can actually occur.

696
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,484
Now, if the dual problem is solvable,
which generally it is right, then It,

697
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:49,280
it, it says the original problem can
actually be solved.

698
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,353
That means it's all very rough, but

699
00:40:50,353 --> 00:40:52,830
the original problem can be solved by
convex optimization.

700
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,430
It's tractable.

701
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,200
That's very interesting.

702
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,840
And, by the way, the general case there is
the following.

703
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,242
Any optimization problem involving exactly
two quadratic functions, so

704
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:07,218
minimize a quadratic function subject to
quadratic inequality or

705
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:13,270
something like that Every such problem can
be solved exactly, okay?

706
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,663
And, convex or not.

707
00:41:15,663 --> 00:41:18,927
That's a, I mean there's many ways, what,
there's many ways to understand why

708
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:22,730
that's true, but [COUGH] one is to
understand the following.

709
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:29,485
It says that, for all such problems, the
dual problem is actually an SDP.

710
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:34,600
And you can prove using, in fact, you have
to use the structure of the problem.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,040
You know, some algebraic geometry.

712
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
Something like that.

713
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,983
That basically says there's zero duality
gap.

714
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:42,161
And I should say a little bit about this,

715
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:46,700
what the connection is to things that
we've seen.

716
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,037
You know, if you think about what are all
the problems that people can

717
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:50,312
actually solve?

718
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:51,239
Right.

719
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,687
Well, a huge number of them are convex but
some are not, and

720
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:57,140
there's some real obvious ones just
glaring out there.

721
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,840
I mean here's one.

722
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,090
If I walk up to you and I say, oh I say,
how do you solve this problem.

723
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:10,110
Like, you know, maximize x, x transpose P
x subject to say norm x 2 equals 1.

724
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,760
How do you solve that?

725
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,700
Well we know the answer.

726
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,828
I mean you take the largest Eigen value of
P and

727
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,945
x is the Eigen vector associated with
that.

728
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:19,400
Fine.

729
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,299
This thing is not close to i mean that's
not convex right ,p could be anything ,if

730
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:28,701
p is negative semi-definite or something
then this is a convex problem but

731
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:33,458
other than that this works always p can be
positive definite ,it doesn't make any

732
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:42,202
difference at all And that equality
constraint sure is not convex, right?

733
00:42:42,202 --> 00:42:47,380
yeah, I mean you can relax it to this, and
it becomes convex, right?

734
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,455
But, in general, that's not convex, right?

735
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:52,670
So, and this is, of course, this is the
basis of all sorts of things.

736
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,590
This is the basis of PCA,

737
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,610
principal component analysis, singular
value decomposition.

738
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,500
These are used everywhere.

739
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,110
All the time.

740
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,273
All sorts of cool stuff.

741
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:02,979
Okay?
And these are nonconvex problems.

742
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:07,230
So, if someone asks you, what are you
doing offsetting convex optimization.

743
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,570
Why?
Because a lot of problems are convex.

744
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,690
If they say, are all problems convex?

745
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,830
You say, absolutely not.

746
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,397
And, and

747
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:17,870
ones that are widely used that are not
convex, examples would be PCA and SVD.

748
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,018
But, what this says is There's at least a
weird technical argument you can

749
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,990
make where you'd argue that PCA and

750
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:29,260
SDP can't arc, they're solvable because
they're convex.

751
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,410
I mean I don't believe that, that's weird,
but there is a connection.

752
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,497
You can solve them using convex
optimization and it's this.

753
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:37,265
Let's look at,

754
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:42,458
return to this specific example, which is
a special case of this by the way.

755
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:47,078
sort of ,so the dual function here is to
you take the adjective and to that you add

756
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:51,978
this inequality with a lambda and you get
that ,you get a quadratic function,but you

757
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:56,528
can minimize a quadratic function right if
its negative i's minus infinity or

758
00:43:56,528 --> 00:44:01,568
otherwise workout what this is and you end
up With a dual problem that looks like

759
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:09,920
this and it's actually easiest to write it
as an SDP.

760
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,930
It's cleaner.

761
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,279
It says maximize minus t minus lambda
subject to this lmi.

762
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,331
Okay?

763
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:19,710
Now, that is an SDP.

764
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,028
We can solve this thing.

765
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:23,370
Here's what's interesting.

766
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,800
The gap, the optimal value of this problem
is actually always exactly equal to

767
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,630
the optimal value of that one.

768
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,614
This one is a non-convex problem.

769
00:44:33,614 --> 00:44:38,010
This one is convex, and tractable, right?

770
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,870
And that says we have a way to solve this
problem.

771
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,280
Now, you know, in some special cases you
already knew that.

772
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,640
I mean you, you know, you don't And
obviously when we teach people linear

773
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,384
algebra and you learn about things like
PCA the first time,

774
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:52,408
you don't tell students at that point
about things like you know,

775
00:44:52,408 --> 00:44:55,656
SDP duality and things like that, you just
say look we can compute the,

776
00:44:55,656 --> 00:45:02,487
you know, the [UNKNOWN] vectors or
something, that's the solution.

777
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:05,966
But it is interesting that there is this
connection.

778
00:45:05,966 --> 00:45:07,829
Okay I think we're going to do,

779
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,689
one last thing we're going to do is get a
geometric interpretation of what p

780
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:19,870
star is, of what d star, and in fact what
a duality gap looks like.

781
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,600
So here's what it is.

782
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,115
We're going to do it for a super duper
simple problem...

783
00:45:23,115 --> 00:45:28,120
With one objective f 0 one constraint f 1
of x is less than 0.

784
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,400
And we're going to write down this in the
following plane this is going to be

785
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,237
the constraint function that is f 1 right.

786
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,550
This axis is going to be f 0.

787
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:44,766
And so your goal g is going to be the set
of all possible pairs of values of f 1,

788
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:48,914
f 0 and So your job is to focus only on
ones where the, the first component is

789
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:56,000
less than equal to 0 and among them find
the lowest value there.

790
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,989
So in other words, we should take this
picture,

791
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:02,690
we should focus only on the left because
these are feasible points.

792
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,056
And then among those points that gives you
this little thing that goes down like

793
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,430
this, a little nose-like thing.

794
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,845
And then it says, go as, go as low as you
can here.

795
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:14,195
And the answer is you go right down there,
and then that's p star.

796
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:15,260
Okay?

797
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,521
Now you see what p star is.

798
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:17,755
That's what it is.

799
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:18,413
All right.

800
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:24,350
So, I mean here's a, here's for example a
point that has a lower value of f zero.

801
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,294
But it's infeasible because this means,
the fact that it's to the right says it's,

802
00:46:28,294 --> 00:46:30,962
f 1 is positive and therefore it's
infeasible, okay, so

803
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,166
this is the picture, this picture right
here,

804
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:38,435
this little point here is going to show,
is going to be p star.

805
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:39,500
Okay.

806
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,000
Now let's look at legrange duality,

807
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,100
because on the same plot we can actually
look...

808
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,036
At the lagrange dual problem and see what
happens.

809
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:51,716
So on the, the lagrange dual says take a
what you do is, you take lamda one and

810
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:55,964
you take inner product of lamda one with
this vector and minimize it and

811
00:46:55,964 --> 00:47:00,572
the minimum value of that, that's exactly,
that's exactly is g of lamda and so

812
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:05,324
what it says is you take uh, [COUGH] you
take a vector like this who's normal,

813
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:09,356
whose slope is in this case because you're
multiplying lambda one,

814
00:47:09,356 --> 00:47:16,850
that's the first thing.

815
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,075
The slope is exactly lamda, negatve lamda
and we minimize it.

816
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:21,150
Okay?

817
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,750
And so what that says is, I set the slope.

818
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:30,210
In the slope, then, we find the, in this
whole set here, we find the closest point.

819
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,018
So if lambda is big enough, you get this
value, and as you crank it up,

820
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:38,020
you would get things like up, up here.

821
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,530
Right?

822
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,520
And you could see that this thing, this
is, this would go like this turn.

823
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,380
It would actually at one point it's
supported at 2 points there and

824
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,760
then it would keep rotating that way and
it turns out in that picture where that

825
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,905
intersects this axis here that's d star
exactly.

826
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:54,500
Okay?

827
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,536
And so that says for example if I take
lambda that's totally inappropriate like

828
00:47:57,536 --> 00:48:01,985
this one here that's going to lambda, this
continues down there and way down here.

829
00:48:01,985 --> 00:48:07,150
They, they cross and that crossing value,
that's a lower bound on p star.

830
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,555
Well in, indeed it is.

831
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,120
It's a really crappy one.

832
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,600
As I take lambda and change it so I move
like this,

833
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,235
that lower bound gets better and better
and better until right when I'm here.

834
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:21,270
Right.

835
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,670
I now, I now hit this part and when I keep
rotating, which is changing lambda.

836
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,560
In this case, I am turning lambda down.

837
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,735
I keep rotating and now my, my,

838
00:48:29,735 --> 00:48:35,820
this, the dual objective value, g of
lambda, goes down now.

839
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,492
And it reached its maximum right when it
was touching its [INAUDIBLE] destart and

840
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:43,146
so now you can see exactly what duality
gap is, right.

841
00:48:43,146 --> 00:48:47,946
The duality gap is exactly the following,
its the gap between this thing that

842
00:48:47,946 --> 00:48:54,150
whenever this whenever horizontally here
and then the best.

843
00:48:54,150 --> 00:49:00,270
A line that was tangent to this set g, and
what you get there is this point,

844
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:07,870
and this gives you the duality gap as this
distance here.

845
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:14,772
And, in fact, this picture is enough to
tell you almost everything.

846
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:19,754
So you can see Its not true that G convex
when F0 and F1 are convex,

847
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:28,430
what is true is the lower, the lower left
facing face of G, that's convex.

848
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,800
So you can see here, the reason we got a
duality gap here.

849
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,684
Is clear, is because we were able to sort
of hide the solution inside a dent in

850
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,610
this G.

851
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,742
If G is convex or at least its lower left
face is convex, you can't hide,

852
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:46,580
there's always a supporting hyper plane,
it goes there.

853
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:52,800
So, that's this picture once you
understand it all, it explains.

854
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,262
Pretty much why, for

855
00:49:54,262 --> 00:50:00,390
convex optimization problems you
generically have zero duality gap.

856
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,690
The, the truth is you can also understand
Slater's condition using this

857
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,182
graph as well.

858
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:12,794
Okay, so how do you do that next step?

859
00:50:12,794 --> 00:50:14,120
That's simple.

860
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,750
What you do, is we replace that g with its
epigraph.

861
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,636
And what we do is we simply replace
things, it's sort of,

862
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:22,465
it's these values plus everything up and
to the right.

863
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:29,612
Now, that set is convex if f one and f
zero are convex, that set is convex.

864
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,036
Okay?

865
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:33,840
And nothing changes if you do this.

866
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,230
And then, strong duality Basically, is the
following.

867
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,232
It says, if at this point there is a
non-vertical supporting hyperplane,

868
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:45,380
then strong duality holds.

869
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,840
And Slater's condition says the following:
it says A is convex.

870
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,194
And it also says, it says that not only A
is convex but

871
00:50:52,194 --> 00:50:55,728
it says the very important part.

872
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:59,247
Which is this, which is that A penetrates
over to the left and,

873
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:04,077
therefore, at this point, here, it has a
non-vertical supporting hyperplane which

874
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:08,769
looks like that and, sure enough, that
slope is the optimal Lagrange multiplier,

875
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:15,995
lambda star and then, in this case, you
get p star equals t star.

876
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:19,845
So, that's the picture for, that's what
happens when you apply

877
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:26,060
that's the analysis that even explains the
geometry of the Slater condition.

878
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,950
The next topic is this idea of
complimentary slackness.

879
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,550
And so we'll start assuming the following.

880
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,640
Assume x star is primal optimal.

881
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,250
And we have dual optimal variables, lambda
star, nu star.

882
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,338
And what that means is That f0 of x* -

883
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:48,700
that is the objective attained by x* - is
equal to g of lambda*, nu*.

884
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,397
And that's the lower bound that you get
from LaGrange duality from (no

885
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:58,700
period) The, dual variables, lambda star,
and nu star.

886
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,122
And of course, we assume that x star is
primal feasible, lambda star and

887
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,890
nu star have to be dual feasible.

888
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,870
And of course if we have this equality,
that's the end of the story.

889
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,350
We know for sure.

890
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,546
x star is optimal for the primal problem
and

891
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:17,140
we also know by the way that lambda star
and nu star optimal for the dual problem.

892
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,880
Okay, so now assuming that you have a
primal dual pair.

893
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,175
I'll call it a pair because it's a pair of
a primal variable and

894
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:24,960
a set of dual variables.

895
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,670
If I have a primal dual pair, let's see
what it means.

896
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:33,270
Well This dual, function value it that's
by definition.

897
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,500
That's the emphemom over X of this thing.

898
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,464
Well the emphemom over X is certainly less
than if I plug in any particular value of

899
00:52:40,464 --> 00:52:46,440
X, so I'm going to plug in X Star, my
primal optimum point.

900
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,490
I say that this thing is, of course, less
than that.

901
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:55,584
And in fact, you get equality here if and
only if x* also minimizes the legrontian.

902
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:56,835
??
We'll come back to that in a bit.

903
00:52:56,835 --> 00:52:58,849
So, right now I'll just say that's less
than or

904
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:02,580
equal to that, but now we're going to
observe the following.

905
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,142
We're going to observe that.

906
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:09,714
'x star' is feasible therefore the 'fi's
are less than or equal to zero.

907
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:12,860
The 'lamda i' is, 'lamda i' is feasible
too.

908
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,378
So 'lamda i' star has been bigger than or

909
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:18,490
equal to zero and therefore each of these
numbers is less than or equal to zero.

910
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,630
The sum is less than or equal to zero.

911
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,866
This thing is less than or equal to zero
and this term here is zero Why?

912
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:28,034
Because if x is feasible, h i of x star is
0 and

913
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:33,140
therefore, this is just 0 and just goes
away.

914
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,385
And we see that this is f 0 of x star plus
something less or equal to 0,

915
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:39,420
and that's less or equal to that.

916
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,135
And now we have a chain.

917
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:46,080
And we see that in fact, these must have
been equalities here.

918
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,745
These must have been inequalities, okay,
so

919
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:50,706
they're inequalities now we go back and
see what it means.

920
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:54,864
Well it can mean, the only plea, it means
actually two things, and

921
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:58,290
we get some interesting things.

922
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,445
The first is, it says x star minimizes the
lagrangian...

923
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:07,403
okay that says if the Lagrangian evaluated
with dual variables the optimal ones

924
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:11,769
right so that says if we have dual optima
lambda * new * then any optimal x

925
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:16,505
minimizes the Lagrangian has to be because
the argument i used here was that x

926
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:23,790
is optimal and lambda * and new * is
optimal Okay.

927
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,660
That's the first one.

928
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,930
And that's what would give you equality
here.

929
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,890
Now, to get equality here, this term must
be zero.

930
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:34,040
But if the sum of terms that are less than
or equal to zero, if the sum of things

931
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,530
less than or equal to zero is zero, every
single one is less, is equal to zero.

932
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,650
And, in that case, you get something very
interesting.

933
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,555
It says that the individual products
lambda i star and f i star of x,

934
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:48,750
f i of x star, those are zero.

935
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,505
And that's called complementary slackness,
that's the name for that condition.

936
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:55,990
And, there's several ways to say it.

937
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,011
But it basically says that you have the
inequality,

938
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:01,398
you have several inequalities, you have
two inequalities here.

939
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,490
You have lambda i.

940
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:06,825
Bigger and equal to zero and you have fi
of x less than zero.

941
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:11,817
And to say that one of these inequalities
is slack is the same as saying that it

942
00:55:11,817 --> 00:55:14,660
holds strictly.

943
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,312
And so what it says is that if one of
these holds,

944
00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:23,180
if one of these holds with some slack, the
other must hold without slack.

945
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,560
You can't have slack on both.

946
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,680
That's basically what this is saying.

947
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,320
In fact the product has to be 0.

948
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,045
So another way to say it is, if the
optimal Lagrange multiplier is positive,

949
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:38,990
strictly positive, then that constraint
absolutely must be tight.

950
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:39,724
That's what it says.

951
00:55:39,724 --> 00:55:40,328
Okay?

952
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:42,488
Conversely, if a constraint, I mean, well,

953
00:55:42,488 --> 00:55:46,100
it's not conversely, it's kind of the same
statement.

954
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,520
It says if, if a constraint is slack,if
there is an optimal point where the i

955
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,008
th constraint is slack that what this less
than equal to 0 restrictly less than 0

956
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:58,816
means that says,the associative optimal
branch multiply must be 0

957
00:55:58,816 --> 00:56:03,440
ok,now the meaning by all the things is
actually quiet An interesting statement,

958
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,384
because this holds for any optimal x and
any optimal lambda and nu, and

959
00:56:07,384 --> 00:56:11,532
what that says is, if, if, I mean if it's
just a unique optimal x star and

960
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:15,748
a unique optimal [UNKNOWN] star nu star it
just says these things hold, but

961
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,856
other than that it holds actually for

962
00:56:17,856 --> 00:56:27,020
any optimal x...

963
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,492
Any optimal lambda star new star.

964
00:56:29,492 --> 00:56:31,280
So okay.

965
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,530
So this leads us straight to something
called the the KKT conditions.

966
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,970
It's an interesting story behind this,
Kuhn and

967
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,036
Tucker published worked out these
conditions.

968
00:56:44,036 --> 00:56:47,394
Um,and then Several years later, I mean a
substantially long time later, and in fact

969
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:52,720
you can look in old books and find these
referred to as the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

970
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,324
And they, at some point somebody did some
well was poking around somewhere and

971
00:56:56,324 --> 00:56:59,875
found out that Karush had written a
masters thesis at University of Chicago,

972
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:05,115
completely unpublished, with essentially
the same ideas in it.

973
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:08,040
And Kuhn and Tucker were nice enough to
append,

974
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,490
actually to prepend [UNKNOWN] name to the
results.

975
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,735
So it's now the KKT conditions.

976
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:20,255
Okay, so here I have a problem with
differentiable fi, and hi.

977
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:20,830
'Kay?

978
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:25,870
So, and it says here, here, here are the,
here are the Karun, the KKT,

979
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,392
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

980
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:33,540
First of all, primal feasibility.

981
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,232
That's the, you have to satisfy, x
satisfies inequalities and

982
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:40,663
x satisfies the equality constraints.

983
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:41,360
Okay?

984
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,871
Dual constraints, dual inequality
constraints I should say.

985
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:47,160
Lambda has to bigger than or equal to
zero.

986
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,344
Complementary slackness that says that
here,

987
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:52,130
whenever lambda i is positive, f i is
zero.

988
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,100
That's one way to say it.

989
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,310
You could say it the other way around.

990
00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:00,270
You could say that whenever fi is
negative, you must have lambda i zero.

991
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,504
And the fourth condition is that the
gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to

992
00:58:03,504 --> 00:58:05,130
x vanishes, right?

993
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,640
So that is the gradient with respect to q,
x Of L,

994
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,690
and that's given by the gradient of f0
plus sum lambda i

995
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:21,670
gradient fi of x plus sum of this nu i
times the gradient hi of x equals 0.

996
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,260
Okay?
So, these conditions all together,

997
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,460
that's called the KKT conditions, and what
we saw on the previous slide here is

998
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,580
the following: that if f, if, if the fi,
if the problem is convex and X landa and

999
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:44,390
new are optimal, which really means x is
primal optimal, landa new is dual optimal.

1000
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:49,310
If that's the case, then these four
conditions hold, right?

1001
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,150
This holds.

1002
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:54,298
The idea, this holds because we saw here
that whenever this holds when you

1003
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,990
have zero duality gap.

1004
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,610
X star must minimize the lagrangian here.

1005
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,200
This is a convex function.

1006
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,880
Right?
And if f, if f zero f i and

1007
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,360
h i are differentiable, the idea that x
zero star minimizes this says that if i

1008
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:16,300
plug in x zero star here and take the
gradient, I better get zero.

1009
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,005
Right?
So that, that recovers this condition.

1010
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:23,517
So, what that says is for a convex
optimization problem,

1011
00:59:23,517 --> 00:59:29,120
if x lambda nu are optimal, KKT conditions
hold.

1012
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,049
Now the converse is also true.

1013
00:59:31,049 --> 00:59:34,830
You have to be kind of careful about this,
but the converse says this.

1014
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,378
If I have three points, x tilde, lambda
tilde, nu tilde, and

1015
00:59:37,378 --> 00:59:42,300
they satisfy the KKT conditions, and it's
a convex problem Then they're optimal.

1016
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,453
And you have to go back and check various
things.

1017
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:50,003
From complementary slackness, you can show
the following,

1018
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:55,080
that f zero of x tilde is l of x tilde
lambda tilde new tilde.

1019
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,033
>> That's easy because, well the only
difference here are the sum lambda i

1020
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,842
tilde times fi of Fi of x tilde but

1021
01:00:00,842 --> 01:00:07,500
that product is zero, that's by our
assumption of complementary slackness.

1022
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,550
And the other one holds too because of
primal feasibility of

1023
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,040
the equality constraints.

1024
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,690
So you get this.

1025
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,090
From the fourth condition, that says that
that,

1026
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,870
it says that the gradient of the
Lagrangian evaluated with dual variables,

1027
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:22,890
lambda tilde and nu tilde, the gradient
with respect to x vanishes at x tilde, but

1028
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,770
it's a convex function, the Lagrangian
with respect to x,

1029
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:31,940
and if its gradient is zero, you must have
minimized it.

1030
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,260
So, that tells us that x tilde minimizes
that, and that tells you that If x

1031
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,260
tilde minimizes it, then this thing is
equal to g, the lower bound.

1032
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,068
And we are now done, because we've shown
that g of lambda tilde,

1033
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:48,254
which is a lower bound on the optimal
value, is equal to f zero of x tilde,

1034
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:53,480
where x tilde's primal feasible, and
that's the end of the story.

1035
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,250
X, x, x tilde is primal optimal.

1036
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,168
And by the way lambda tilde and v tilde
are dual opt.

1037
01:00:59,168 --> 01:01:00,185
>> Optimal.

1038
01:01:00,185 --> 01:01:04,340
So, okay, so that is the argument for
this.

1039
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,432
So roughly speaking, you can say that
Slater's condition sorry the KKT

1040
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:11,798
conditions are the necessary and
sufficient conditions for

1041
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:18,720
optimality for a convex optimism problem
with equality and inequality constraints.

1042
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,294
So now it assumes that the fi, the
objective and

1043
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:25,510
the constraint functions are all
differentiable.

1044
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,942
Right?
And it's a nice extension of the standard

1045
01:01:27,942 --> 01:01:33,980
optimality condition for an unconstrained
problem which is the gradient as zero.

1046
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,192
Right?

1047
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,284
So that's the idea.

1048
01:01:37,284 --> 01:01:38,256
Okay.

1049
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:44,400
Now, in a few cases The KKT conditions
allow you to solve a problem.

1050
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,310
Now they're not the most interesting
problems.

1051
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,066
And there's other ways we can think of
them.

1052
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,620
But they do give you I mean they do come
up.

1053
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,080
And they're interesting to look at.

1054
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,540
So, here's an example.

1055
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,174
This one comes up in, for example,
wireless communications.

1056
01:01:57,174 --> 01:02:00,213
What you've got is you want to minimize
the sum.

1057
01:02:00,213 --> 01:02:06,500
Log XI plus Alpha I or Alpha I or a bunch
of positive constants that you're given.

1058
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,230
And the Xs have to be bigger or equal to 0
and they have to sum to 1.

1059
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,104
Right, this is, this is the,

1060
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,520
they get summed to any other number, this
is good enough.

1061
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:17,480
And so that's the question, right.

1062
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,290
So how do you, how do you solve this.

1063
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,885
Oh, by the way, if you're curious what
these things are.

1064
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:27,210
X could be the power in a channel.

1065
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,525
And you want to allocate the power across
a bunch of channels.

1066
01:02:30,525 --> 01:02:36,550
And the alpha has to do with the signal to
noise, the signal sorry, the noise level.

1067
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:40,262
In that channel, right, and this says how
do you optimize the maximum,

1068
01:02:40,262 --> 01:02:46,236
how do you get the maximum bit rate by
allocating power to different channels.

1069
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:46,814
Okay.

1070
01:02:46,814 --> 01:02:47,821
Alright.

1071
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:51,175
Well let's write, let's just write down
the KKT conditions.

1072
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:53,605
Write down the KKT conditions, you need a
lambda and a [UNKNOWN],

1073
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:56,575
there's a lambda associated with the
inequality constraints and a [UNKNOWN],

1074
01:02:56,575 --> 01:03:00,812
a single scaler [UNKNOWN] associated with
this single constraint here...

1075
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:05,610
Okay, so, x is optimal, if and only if
it's not a negative.

1076
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,180
It's [UNKNOWN] one.

1077
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,860
That's primal feasibility.

1078
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:12,290
And there exists a vector landed in our
end, which is now negative.

1079
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,070
Right?

1080
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:18,320
And a single number new and they have to
have the following property.

1081
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:23,342
This is simply writing down the partial
derivative of the Lagrangian with

1082
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:28,121
respect to,this is simply the partial
Lagrangian with respect to x and

1083
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:32,576
you get the following condition,we get the
condition here this is

1084
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:37,679
complementary slackness and that is the
gradient of Lagrangian respect to

1085
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:43,025
x is zero now we stare at these thing and
we can work various things out Let's see,

1086
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:48,290
if I told you that if for example, well we
can work out, the conditions actually

1087
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:57,390
just depend on this one, right.

1088
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:04,820
If xi is zero, here, then we get one over
alpha i plus lambda i equals new.

1089
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,770
And so we can work out what lambda i is,
and if lambda i would be

1090
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,591
new minus one over alpha i So that, that,
that gives you alpha i.

1091
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:14,733
Sorry that gives you lambda i.

1092
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:17,890
Okay.
On the other hand when x is positive you

1093
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:22,770
have to have lambda 0 and for those if
lambda is 0, again we can get what x is,

1094
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:31,160
x is one over from this equation, x is one
over nu minus alpha i.

1095
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,471
And the only thing that we haven't
satisfied yet, is this condition here.

1096
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,598
oh, and we can work out what these two
conditions are because it's going to

1097
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:43,673
depend on whether nu is less than one over
alpha or bigger than one over alpha.

1098
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:47,520
That's the conditions under which you end
up with something.

1099
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,713
That satisfies this with alpha being
bigger than or

1100
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:53,591
equal you know with, using the fact that
the alphas are positive.

1101
01:04:53,591 --> 01:04:56,665
Okay, so what that says is, if you work
out what these values are,

1102
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:59,391
it says we're going to determine nu from
one transpose x,

1103
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:04,850
but if x has either this value or this
value it's e-, it's this.

1104
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,300
It's the max of 0 and 1 over new minus
aplha i.

1105
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,072
And we simply have the some of those as
equal to 1.

1106
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:14,580
Okay, now, you'd notice a couple of things
here.

1107
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,770
We're going to adjust new to make this
true.

1108
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:20,370
Now, that can be done y, because if I
increase Nu,

1109
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:26,450
this goes down therefore, everything here
goes down.

1110
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,630
So the sum is monotone decreasing.

1111
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:32,962
If Nu is, you know, gigantic I get if Nu
is extremely large, right,

1112
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:37,306
then this is max of 0, then this is just.

1113
01:05:37,306 --> 01:05:40,240
Zero, this le-, left-hand had zero, so
you're way under one.

1114
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,731
On the other hand, if nu is tiny, then one
over lambda, nu,

1115
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,256
one over nu is a very big number.

1116
01:05:45,256 --> 01:05:49,696
You subtract alpha i and this is a very
big number, and you're way over one.

1117
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:52,662
So you can simply use bisection, it's
monotone.

1118
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:56,709
Okay, and there's a beautiful
interpretation which give the name of

1119
01:05:56,709 --> 01:06:02,452
this method water-filling and the idea is
something like this.

1120
01:06:02,452 --> 01:06:04,690
You draw a profile of the alphas.

1121
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,950
So, these are, these are the alphas,
right?

1122
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:11,350
This is i, that's i equals one, two,
three, that doesn't matter of course.

1123
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,694
And then what happens is,

1124
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:16,788
it's says that you choose a value, new,
that's right here.

1125
01:06:16,788 --> 01:06:20,977
You write 1 over nu here and then you
imagine that you take this thing and

1126
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,050
you flood it to this level.

1127
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:24,920
Okay?

1128
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,240
So you, you flood it to this level and
what you do is you,

1129
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:34,880
is this, this amount here That is actually
x i.

1130
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,130
All right?

1131
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:39,550
So, and the, and the idea is you take a
total unit of one amount of water and

1132
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,918
you dump it on this thing, and

1133
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:45,780
when it all settles out, the sum of all
these will be one.

1134
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,900
And that's exactly what we have here.

1135
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,440
And the depth will be the correct value of
x i.

1136
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,130
So you can see here that for example X3 is
zero, right?

1137
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,540
So are these two, whatever they are.

1138
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,370
They're zero, and that's the idea, okay?

1139
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,340
So this so, it's water filling.

1140
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,456
If you've taken a class on information
theory, you have definitely seen this.

1141
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:09,608
Now the last topic,

1142
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:13,928
in duality that we're going to look at in
standard duality before we look at

1143
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:20,790
other variations on it is this idea of
perturbation and sensitivity analysis.

1144
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:24,272
This is extremely useful.

1145
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:29,160
It's also a very good way to think of it
and it is, has huge practical use.

1146
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,476
So let's see what it is.

1147
01:07:30,476 --> 01:07:34,610
We start with the, an unperturbed problem.

1148
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,320
That's this one.

1149
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,000
Okay?

1150
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,190
And it's dual.

1151
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,420
There's the dual.

1152
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,060
So the unperturbed problem says here is
some constraints, inequality constraints.

1153
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,320
Here's equality constraints.

1154
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,570
And what we're going to do now is we're
going to perturb the problem.

1155
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,850
And let me explain what that means.

1156
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:51,777
We are going to change the right hand side
Here from zero to ui,

1157
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:56,995
here and in the quality constraints from
zero to vi.

1158
01:07:56,995 --> 01:07:58,670
Okay?

1159
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,350
Now when you do this.

1160
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:02,140
I mean, these are just constants.

1161
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,380
They go there and you can figure out
exactly how they affect the dual function.

1162
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,080
You get a new dual that's that.

1163
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,744
That's the new dual problem, okay?

1164
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:10,305
So.
And

1165
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:14,258
what we're going to do is we're going to
let p star of u,v, that's going to

1166
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:20,355
be the optimal value of this perturbed
problem as a function of u and v.

1167
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:21,930
Okay, so that's the idea.

1168
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,285
Now, we'll be able to show pretty quickly
that's a convex problem,

1169
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:28,245
it's a convex function of u and v.

1170
01:08:28,245 --> 01:08:32,429
And what, what we want to do is get some
information about p star u and v.

1171
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:33,461
And first, before we do that,

1172
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:36,820
let me say a little bit about the
interpretation of what it means.

1173
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:41,500
here, if, let's concentrate not on the vi,
which is actually hard to interpret, but

1174
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:46,950
let's look at the conc-, let's concentrate
on what ui means here.

1175
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:53,580
If ui Here is equal to, let's say, 0.1.

1176
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,750
The question is, what does that mean?

1177
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,080
Well, if let's take it u1 is 0.1.

1178
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,480
If u1 is 0.1, it means precisely the
following.

1179
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,080
It is, your first,

1180
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,315
your original constraint was f1 of x had
to be less than or equal to zero.

1181
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:06,785
F1 of x, is basically,

1182
01:09:06,785 --> 01:09:11,900
the idea is that 0 is right when you've
reached some resource.

1183
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,246
And what it says, that if you perturb it
by making that point 1,

1184
01:09:14,246 --> 01:09:16,224
it says you've given about point 1 more
units, well,

1185
01:09:16,224 --> 01:09:19,474
you've given point 1 more units of
resource.

1186
01:09:19,474 --> 01:09:22,365
To the 1st, whatever the 1st constraint
handles, right, so

1187
01:09:22,365 --> 01:09:26,377
you have more resources or you could say
its a relaxation because the feasible set

1188
01:09:26,377 --> 01:09:32,210
is bigger, but whatever happens, I
gaurantee you, this thing goes down.

1189
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:36,170
Right, because I give you its a circuit
design problem and the 1st constrain

1190
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:42,270
express the power constraint and I tell
you I'm going to give you 0.1 more power.

1191
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,770
You better come up with a better design.

1192
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,618
Not a better design, but certainly you can
come up,

1193
01:09:45,618 --> 01:09:48,621
you can, you shouldn't come up with a
worse design, right?

1194
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:50,689
So, that's what that is.

1195
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:54,819
So you would say that when ui is positive,
you would say something like,

1196
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:59,570
I have loosened the ith inequality, ith
constraint.

1197
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:04,060
On the other hand, if ui is negative, you
have tightened the ith inequality.

1198
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,910
That's what that means.

1199
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,750
Tightening it means You've restricted the
resources, and so one.

1200
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,818
Now, by the way, if I tighten this
problem, if I tighten the constraint,

1201
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:16,410
there's no reason to believe that this
thing cannot go to plus infinity.

1202
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,889
I can tight, I can tighten the constraint,
and the whole problem becomes unfeasible,

1203
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:23,315
and this number, p* of u, v will then be
plus infinity.

1204
01:10:23,315 --> 01:10:24,222
Okay?

1205
01:10:24,222 --> 01:10:29,487
So alright, so what we're interested in
then and one, one way to interpret what

1206
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:34,428
p star is p star tells you how the optimal
value changes when you tighten or

1207
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:43,120
loosen the inequality constraints and you
can interpret v i as a shift.

1208
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,800
In inequality constraints.

1209
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,456
So that's what that is.

1210
01:10:46,456 --> 01:10:47,864
Okay.

1211
01:10:47,864 --> 01:10:52,760
Now, as a result here it's actually quite
easy to work out.

1212
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,320
You just simply apply weak duality to the
perturbed problem.

1213
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,705
And you get the following.

1214
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:59,700
P star of u and v.

1215
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,510
That's the optimal value of the perturbed
problem.

1216
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:04,600
It's at least as big as P star of 0 0.

1217
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,020
That is the unperturbed problem.

1218
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:11,429
Minus u transpose lambda star, minus v
transpose lambda star.

1219
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:14,967
And this holds for any lambda star new
star [INAUDIBLE] dual optimal, for

1220
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:17,117
the unperturbed problem.

1221
01:11:17,117 --> 01:11:19,319
Okay?
Now this is an inequality.

1222
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:22,464
It says, in fact, it's a, it says that
when you

1223
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:28,630
Perturbed the problem your results will be
at least this bad.

1224
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,831
It's a bound on how good they could be,

1225
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:36,620
because this says if this were able to go
down a lot that would be good.

1226
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,270
And what this says is it puts a lower
bound on it.

1227
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,130
That's what it does.

1228
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,590
There's no upper bound on this.

1229
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,362
You can perturb This, by the slightest
amount, and

1230
01:11:46,362 --> 01:11:52,130
you can have p star equals plus infinity,
and so there's no upper bound here.

1231
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:54,770
It's just that.

1232
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,300
Okay.

1233
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,392
So, let's see what it means, and

1234
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,960
you have to be very careful because it's
asymmetrical.

1235
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,159
Or I should say, this is a global result.

1236
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,556
It's simply You think about it as being
interesting when U and

1237
01:12:03,556 --> 01:12:05,765
V are small, those are perturbations to
the problem, but

1238
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:09,360
in fact, these are, these can be gross
perturbations.

1239
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,894
I can add U equals 7, UI equals 7,

1240
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:14,830
I can do all sorts of things and these
inequalities hold.

1241
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,770
So lets see what they mean.

1242
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:18,020
Well, first of all, it says the following.

1243
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:21,606
If Lambda I star is large.

1244
01:12:21,606 --> 01:12:25,789
Then it says it says that if you tighten a
constraint,

1245
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:30,300
let's forget the equality constraints.

1246
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,470
But let's tighten a constraint.

1247
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,760
That means if you tighten like, it means u
i goes less than or equal to 0.

1248
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,560
And this is minus a negative number.

1249
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,638
Times a positive number, in fact, a large
positive number, and a,

1250
01:12:41,638 --> 01:12:45,280
a pretty good well, here, if, if I tighten
it.

1251
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,700
It says, and then it says this thing will
be worse, this, this will go up, right?

1252
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,710
This'll be positive, this'll go up, and in
fact, it'll go up a lot.

1253
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,582
So for example, if I tell you that lambda
* is 100.

1254
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,042
Let's say, lambda1* (no period) And

1255
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,700
I've tightened the constraint by a mere
point one.

1256
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:10,340
Then what it says is the optimal value of
the new problem absolutely must

1257
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:19,090
go up by at least ten the op that's the
optimal class must go up by ten.

1258
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,330
It can go up by much more.

1259
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,624
It can go up to infinity, for example,

1260
01:13:22,624 --> 01:13:28,928
if by tightening that first constraint,
that rendered the problem infeasible.

1261
01:13:28,928 --> 01:13:33,114
Okay, on the other hand, if lambda i is
small here it,

1262
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:38,847
it says that P star does not decrease that
much if you loosen the constraint,

1263
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:43,670
right, so that says if this is a small
number, here, then it says,

1264
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,038
if U even if U is big and positive it
guarantees that

1265
01:13:48,038 --> 01:13:57,100
the optimal costs can't go down much.

1266
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,076
Right.
By the way,

1267
01:13:58,076 --> 01:14:00,640
the converse assertions you cannot say
here.

1268
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,084
You can't conclude.

1269
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:05,060
Okay.

1270
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,265
And these are, this is, you'd make the
same conclusions for

1271
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:10,415
these things for the inequalities, right,
I won't go through that because actually

1272
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:14,415
the inequalities are probably more
important to understand...

1273
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:16,980
Okay.

1274
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,044
Now, we can also get a local sensitivity
result, and

1275
01:14:19,044 --> 01:14:21,310
this is extremely useful in practice.

1276
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,940
Let's see what this does.

1277
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:28,070
So let's assume that the optimal value is
differentiable at zero zero.

1278
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,598
Now by the way,

1279
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:32,440
there's many cases where it's not so this
is not just a mathematical pathology.

1280
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,965
This can occur in real problems, right?

1281
01:14:34,965 --> 01:14:38,997
And, let's see what it, then it turns out
that we can say what lambda i star and

1282
01:14:38,997 --> 01:14:41,639
nu i star are exactly.

1283
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:45,592
They are the partial derivative of the
optimal cause with respect to u i

1284
01:14:45,592 --> 01:14:48,406
with a negative sign, and the same for nu
i star, and

1285
01:14:48,406 --> 01:14:53,694
that's the, the, it's partial p star,
partial v i.

1286
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:55,380
And that's also with a minus sign.

1287
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,200
Okay?

1288
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,415
Now how do you know that?

1289
01:14:57,415 --> 01:15:03,751
Well, that's easy enough we simply
subtract these two things divide by t and

1290
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:12,400
this thing is, this, I, I let t goes, get
less, go to zero, being positive right.

1291
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,420
This says This number here is always,
actually always, bigger than that number,

1292
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,960
and they're, or its limit is.

1293
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,864
And here, if I let t go up, this number
here is always less than lambda i*

1294
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:28,160
therefore, so is this limit, and
therefore, the limit is equal.

1295
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,810
These are just equal to minus lambda*.

1296
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:35,060
And the picture would look something like
this: here's a single constraint f (no

1297
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:40,310
period) 1 is less, f1 of x is less than or
equal to u.

1298
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,285
That's the perturbed version.

1299
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:45,420
And this gives you p 0 star, right?

1300
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,930
So that is, that's p star of 0.

1301
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,850
That's the original optimal value.

1302
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:54,004
Now, you can see now that as you move, as
you, as you loosen the constraint or

1303
01:15:54,004 --> 01:16:00,300
tighten it If you loosen it, of course,
the objective goes down.

1304
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,630
By the way, that requires you to
re-optimize right there.

1305
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,423
Everything here is with the idea that if
you change the constraints,

1306
01:16:05,423 --> 01:16:07,425
you solve the problem again.

1307
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:09,440
It doesn't mean you get the same answer.

1308
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,718
If you tighten the problem, the optimal
value of p goes up.

1309
01:16:13,718 --> 01:16:16,880
And it is smooth here and differentiable.

1310
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,604
You can see here, the [UNKNOWN] multiplier
is, let's say 3,

1311
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:25,640
right, because it's the negative slope of
that line, right.

1312
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,531
And what the global result here says,

1313
01:16:27,531 --> 01:16:32,300
what this global result says is it gives
you the following inequality.

1314
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:37,670
It simply says that this curve, P star of
U is convex.

1315
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,750
That's what it says, and

1316
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:43,320
it says that, in fact, the 1 given by the
legrange multiplier is here.

1317
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,420
Is it tangent?

1318
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,600
That's essentially what it says.

1319
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,056
And you can see how it could be, for

1320
01:16:47,056 --> 01:16:51,622
example your landa star's about three I'm
just guessing from the picture here.

1321
01:16:51,622 --> 01:16:58,110
If I, this p star could go up to plus
infinity just like that right?

1322
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:58,712
And then I could,

1323
01:16:58,712 --> 01:17:02,335
what I could do is say well I'm going to
tighten that constraint a little bit.

1324
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,750
Right?

1325
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,579
And in fact, the value of p star there,

1326
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,960
it could be plus infinity means the
problem is infeasible right?

1327
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,450
And it's also true that this could go like
that, and that means lambda star is three.

1328
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:19,802
I would loosen it considerably, sort of
expecting the optimal cost to go down, but

1329
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,745
it doesn't go down that much.

1330
01:17:22,745 --> 01:17:26,020
Okay, so this the, this is the idea.

1331
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:29,760
Now what's now I'm going to say something
about the practical import of this.

1332
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,280
What we're going to see later is the
following.

1333
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,127
When you solve a convex optimization
problem,

1334
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:41,205
typically at absolutely zero cost you will
get a set of optimal Lagrange multipliers.

1335
01:17:41,205 --> 01:17:42,810
>> [INAUDIBLE] Dual variance.

1336
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:47,570
It, that's, it's automatically returned
with most methods, and things like that.

1337
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:51,602
And that's actually unbelievably useful in
practice, 'because what happens is it

1338
01:17:51,602 --> 01:17:55,018
means that you have a bunch of constraints
or we can, we can, by the way,

1339
01:17:55,018 --> 01:18:00,604
check our complementary slackness
condition with this right now.

1340
01:18:00,604 --> 01:18:03,596
For example If I have a optimal point, and

1341
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:11,990
f one of x star is minus one, that means,
the first constraint wasn't active.

1342
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:15,110
And now imagine that I perturb the right
hand side.

1343
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,560
Instead of zero, I'd plug in minus 0.1 or
plus 0.1.

1344
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,396
It won't make Any difference and

1345
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:24,440
that tells you partial p star, partial p
one is zero.

1346
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:29,280
What that says exactly what complimentary
slack says.

1347
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,240
It says that if the first [UNKNOWN] is
slack,

1348
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,840
the first optimal dual variable absolutely
must be zero okay?

1349
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,364
So that's, that's quite highly consistent
with this.

1350
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:44,600
Back to this, practical use.

1351
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,690
So the practical use goes something like
this.

1352
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:49,650
You have a big problem, you solve it and
there's a whole bunch of constraints.

1353
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,390
Let's suppose they're inequality
constraints.

1354
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,480
And you look at them.

1355
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,490
Some are slack, some are tight.

1356
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,000
'Kay?
So the slack ones, we know what it means.

1357
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,844
What it means is that Those inequalities,
we impose them in the problem but

1358
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:07,690
we didn't need to in a sense because they
didn't affect the optimal value, okay.

1359
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:11,010
By the way, that does not mean you wasted
your time.

1360
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,958
Because had you, you didn't know ahead of
time before you solved the problem that

1361
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,915
they were going to be slack.

1362
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:17,070
Okay.

1363
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:19,180
But now you look at all the ones that are
slack.

1364
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,425
And you ask yourself something like what
would happen if I tightened or

1365
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:25,170
loosened each one?

1366
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,164
And the answer can be can range.

1367
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:29,740
From the following.

1368
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,670
If I tighten it a small amount, the
problem will simply become infeasible.

1369
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,260
That's the extreme case.

1370
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,981
On the other hand, I could loosen an
inequality considerably, expecting

1371
01:19:39,981 --> 01:19:45,800
the alpha value to go down and it won't go
down very much, might not go down at all.

1372
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,140
That could happen.

1373
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,766
Okay.
So

1374
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:54,350
those 2 things can happen, but for small
pertibations, these things tell you.

1375
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:56,481
How the optimal value changes, right, and

1376
01:19:56,481 --> 01:20:01,020
[COUGH], it allows you to actually, it's a
beautiful interpretation.

1377
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:03,932
it allows you to say that the Lagrange
multipliers tell you how

1378
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,540
tight a constraint is.

1379
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,380
So for example, if I, I could solve a
problem.

1380
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:14,060
Let, let's say I'm doing circuit design
and I want to satisfy something and

1381
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,228
Minimize some objective, and what I'm
going to do is,

1382
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:24,380
I have two constraints, a power limit, and
I have an area limit.

1383
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,720
And when I come back, both of them are
tight.

1384
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,338
That's it.
So out of a 50 milliwatt budget,

1385
01:20:28,338 --> 01:20:32,140
your design comes back using all 50
milliwatts, it's hardly suprising.

1386
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,880
You had a 1 millemeter squared.

1387
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,200
Area constraint.

1388
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,310
You come back using one square millimeter.

1389
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,970
Okay?
Again, hardly surprising.

1390
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:41,710
You were given these resources, you use
them.

1391
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,066
And the question then is what this answers
for

1392
01:20:44,066 --> 01:20:47,230
you automatically is questions like this.

1393
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:52,812
What if I were to increase or decrease the
area or the power budget?

1394
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:58,797
Right, so, and in fact what might happens
is that [UNKNOWN] 1 star is 0.01 and

1395
01:20:58,797 --> 01:21:03,547
lambda 2 star, right, this is power and
this is [UNKNOWN] and

1396
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:08,160
lambda 2 star is 100.

1397
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,590
Yeah it's extreme, but let's suppose that
came back, right.

1398
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:12,980
Let's see what it says.

1399
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:15,255
What it says is that...

1400
01:21:15,255 --> 01:21:20,170
>> This says, now remember that the power
and area constraints are both tight.

1401
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,510
They're both tight.

1402
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,841
They're, they're, you know, you gave 50
milliwatts you used 50 milliwatts,

1403
01:21:23,841 --> 01:21:26,800
you gave a square millimeter, a square
millimeter is what you used.

1404
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,740
So they're both tight.

1405
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,790
But what this says is that in some sense
the power,

1406
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:32,399
the power constraint is less tight.

1407
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:38,770
Because this says I, it probably says that
I could decrease the amount of Power.

1408
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:42,660
I allocate to it, and we could get just
about the same objective, right?

1409
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,068
And also a negative result says this, if I
increase, I suppose I say,

1410
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,470
you know what, I want better performance.

1411
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:53,120
I'm going to double the amount of power
you get from 50 to 100 milowatts.

1412
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,180
Surely if I give you twice the power, you
can get a better design.

1413
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,395
And what this tells you is you cannot.

1414
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:05,450
Now, this tells you that what's really
killing you in this problem is area.

1415
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,726
And so this says, this tells you for sure,
if I were to have the area I gave you,

1416
01:22:08,726 --> 01:22:11,846
like I said, nope, I'm sorry, we can't do
it, the economics doesn't work,

1417
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:17,960
you can't have a whole square millimeter,
I'm going to give you half.

1418
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,685
This is going to guarantee you that the
objective is absolutely guaranteed to

1419
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:25,548
get a, do a lot worse.

1420
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:26,980
So that would be it.

1421
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,485
Now, you could also say, oh because it's
so

1422
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:31,932
tight it says that if I give you more area
you should do better.

1423
01:22:31,932 --> 01:22:34,490
That's actually only a local result.

1424
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:35,180
It's not global.

1425
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:39,819
So, for example you'd expect it and it
might happen but again we don't know.

1426
01:22:39,819 --> 01:22:41,838
It's a local result so.

1427
01:22:41,838 --> 01:22:42,474
Okay.

1428
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:45,004
So, the recap of that is that these
optimal Lagrange multipliers,

1429
01:22:45,004 --> 01:22:48,140
which come for free when you solve a
problem typically.

1430
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,174
Actually give you a very nice and

1431
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:55,514
indeed quantitative measure of how tight
the constraints are with 0, lambda i star,

1432
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:59,668
you know, if lambda i star is 0, meaning
somehow it's not, it's not tight right and

1433
01:22:59,668 --> 01:23:06,588
lambda very big meaning it's a very tight
constraint very constraining.

1434
01:23:06,588 --> 01:23:15,260
What we're going to look at first is the
idea of duality and reformulations.

1435
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:15,968
Alright so

1436
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:20,460
here, let's, let me draw a picture here to
show you how this might work.

1437
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,642
Let's take a problem, p, like this that's
a primal problem And

1438
01:23:24,642 --> 01:23:29,810
then, let's form some equivalent problem
like this.

1439
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:33,550
So this, this this bi-directional arrow
basically says that P

1440
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,900
prime is some problem equivalent to P.

1441
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,968
Now you've seen lots of equivalent
problems, for example,

1442
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:44,098
you can eliminate variables, you can add
new variables, you could give an objective

1443
01:23:44,098 --> 01:23:50,190
as non negative, you might square it or
something like that, minimizing the.

1444
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:53,725
Square is the same as minimizing the thing
as long as its a negative.

1445
01:23:53,725 --> 01:24:00,480
Is lots of things, there are lots of ways
to produce equivalent problems, right.

1446
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,060
Okay, now, duality, through duality we can
make it dual.

1447
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:08,250
So there's the primal problem and there's
the dual.

1448
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,180
And of course we can do that down here,
right?

1449
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,630
So this is D prime, right?

1450
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,980
So, that's our original problem.

1451
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,670
This is our reformulation, right?

1452
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,000
And this reformulation could be simple.

1453
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,926
I mean it could be also very
sophisticated.

1454
01:24:22,926 --> 01:24:23,722
Right?

1455
01:24:23,722 --> 01:24:24,360
Okay.

1456
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,556
Now, when you see a picture like this,
then if you're,

1457
01:24:27,556 --> 01:24:31,704
if you have any training in math or just
sort of minimal aesthetics You

1458
01:24:31,704 --> 01:24:38,670
have an overwhelming urge to do the
following, to draw an arrow like this.

1459
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,476
Right?

1460
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:43,440
When you do this is just, you don't need
to know this, but it's not bad to know.

1461
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,910
This is called a commutative diagram.

1462
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,950
It says that basically, you can get,

1463
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:52,020
that you could say that this dual can be
found, you know, two ways.

1464
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:56,000
It's either the, the dual of the primal Or
you could go this way.

1465
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,380
You could reformulate the primal, from
the, the dual of the reformulation and

1466
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,860
then somehow that's related to this one,
you know, something like that.

1467
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,602
Now of course in some dense D and

1468
01:25:05,602 --> 01:25:09,758
D prime are related because they're
related this way.

1469
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:11,376
Right?

1470
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:17,580
So, so this is very general, very vague
idea of, of what you'd like to happen.

1471
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:26,947
Okay, so the now I'll tell you the bad new
is that this is completely Wrong.

1472
01:25:26,947 --> 01:25:28,199
This doesn't happen.

1473
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,675
This is, this is not accurate.

1474
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:32,990
And there's in general no such thing.

1475
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,495
Now it turns out that's actually very good
news, and

1476
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:36,500
we're going to see why in a minute.

1477
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,840
So it turns out that if you take a
problem, it's in fact,

1478
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,970
at first it sounds strange.

1479
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:44,264
If you take a problem, actually just form
a very simple Form a,

1480
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:47,520
a very simple variation on the problem.

1481
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,420
It's a equivalent.

1482
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,054
Right?
You, you add a variable,you make

1483
01:25:50,054 --> 01:25:53,840
the epigraph version i mean just something
that's totally obvious.

1484
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,370
Right?

1485
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,050
Or you just do something simple.

1486
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:01,843
Then it turns out these duals can be
wildly different.

1487
01:26:01,843 --> 01:26:05,040
We're going to see examples of that soon.

1488
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,485
They can be wildly different.

1489
01:26:06,485 --> 01:26:09,520
And at first, that's too bad, right?

1490
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,192
Because you want, you wanted to idea of a
dual to be intrinsic.

1491
01:26:13,192 --> 01:26:14,630
It's not really.

1492
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,462
It depends very much on the description of
the problem.

1493
01:26:17,462 --> 01:26:20,010
and, but we'll see actually that it's a
very good thing.

1494
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,847
Right?
Because it opens up the ability,

1495
01:26:21,847 --> 01:26:26,635
given a problem, here, of forming many
many different kinds of duals.

1496
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:28,820
And, the method is very simple.

1497
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,890
You take the original problem.

1498
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,455
You then transform it, often, as we'll
see, in a very trivial way, and

1499
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:35,075
then form a dual of that transformation
and

1500
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:39,490
you get something completely different
then if you had done the dual here.

1501
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,161
This one, for

1502
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:45,400
example, we'll see cases where this one is
actually useful and informative.

1503
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,890
Where this one is completely trivial and
completely uninformative.

1504
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:53,168
So, this is the big picture idea that
we're going to look at.

1505
01:26:53,168 --> 01:26:55,475
Okay.

1506
01:26:55,475 --> 01:26:59,610
so, let's let's look at a, a case.

1507
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:00,936
This is an extreme case, but it,

1508
01:27:00,936 --> 01:27:04,060
it proves this, it kind of, it illustrates
this point.

1509
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,941
So here, suppose you want to minimize F0
of ax plus b,

1510
01:27:06,941 --> 01:27:12,042
right, well, there are no constraints, so
what's the Lagrangian?

1511
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:14,895
Well the Lagrangian is the function.

1512
01:27:14,895 --> 01:27:17,570
That's the, that's the Lagrangian.

1513
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,970
Because it's, there are no constraints so

1514
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:21,560
we don't even have to, we have no dual
variables, right.

1515
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,462
That's the Lagrangian and

1516
01:27:22,462 --> 01:27:26,090
now you're asked to minimize the
Lagrangian over the primal variables...

1517
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,439
That would give you the dual function.

1518
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:28,980
All right.

1519
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:31,200
So, you minimize that, and you get the
minimum here.

1520
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,010
It's called p star.

1521
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:32,880
Okay?

1522
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,185
So, the dual function for this is simply p
star.

1523
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:40,510
Now, good news is, we have zero duality
gap, right?

1524
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:44,522
Because the, if I ask you to maximize the
constant p star over, well, no variables,

1525
01:27:44,522 --> 01:27:49,632
'cuz there are no dual variables That's
easy to do the answer is p *.

1526
01:27:49,632 --> 01:27:52,668
And then you say hey look at that, that's
fantastic that's the, that's the minimum,

1527
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:56,421
that's the primal optimal object, that's
the primal optimal objective.

1528
01:27:56,421 --> 01:28:01,330
So, so now you can see it, but it's
completely useless right.

1529
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:04,298
Okay now what we're going to do is this
we're going to simply take this

1530
01:28:04,298 --> 01:28:06,842
problem and rewrite it this way.

1531
01:28:06,842 --> 01:28:07,850
Okay?

1532
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,930
So, the only thing we've done here is you
introduced a new variable, y.

1533
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:14,411
And a bunch of equal, this second
constraint, it just says y is ax plus b,

1534
01:28:14,411 --> 01:28:16,280
yeah ax plus b.

1535
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,232
I mean, the equivalence of this problem
and

1536
01:28:19,232 --> 01:28:24,110
this problem are, is completely
transparent, right.

1537
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,990
It's just totally obvious.

1538
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:28,030
It's so simple, it's ridiculous.

1539
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:30,406
And then you say well And this is if you
like, that's P,

1540
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:33,940
this is P prime in the picture I drew
before.

1541
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:40,540
And now you say, let's find P prime star,
which would be, I guess, B prime, right.

1542
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,630
So lets find that.

1543
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,620
So lets take this thing and form the dual,
well the dual turns out to be this and,

1544
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:47,564
I'm not going to go into the details but
by now you shouldn't be surprised that

1545
01:28:47,564 --> 01:28:52,080
something like this would happen, you can
write it explicitly.

1546
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,538
Its maximize B transpose Nu minus.

1547
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,856
The conjugate here of, of f, of the
objective of nu,

1548
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:02,438
subject a transpose nu equals 0, okay, so
this one here, is in fact,

1549
01:29:02,438 --> 01:29:07,099
first of all, it's not, the duel of this
one is absolutely silly, right,

1550
01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:15,370
it's silly the constant, which is the
optimal value, um...

1551
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:18,538
This one is actually useful informative it
is

1552
01:29:18,538 --> 01:29:23,039
not hard to imagine applications of this,
right?

1553
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,518
When you're solving some gigantic problem
and you just want to stop in criterion or

1554
01:29:26,518 --> 01:29:29,409
something like that, so the point is you
look at your algorithm and if at

1555
01:29:29,409 --> 01:29:32,545
any point You can find something that's in
the null space of A transposed new,

1556
01:29:32,545 --> 01:29:34,015
you simply evaluate this number and

1557
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:40,920
that's absolutely guaranteed to be a lower
bound on the optimal value here alright?

1558
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,818
So, so this is a case where A,

1559
01:29:43,818 --> 01:29:51,260
where dualization And trivial
transformation.

1560
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:54,510
They definitely don't commute right in, in
this case.

1561
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:55,630
They, they do not commute.

1562
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:56,950
You, you get, if you transform it and

1563
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:59,678
then form a dual, you get something that
is actually useful, interesting,

1564
01:29:59,678 --> 01:30:04,322
informative, if you don't transform you
get something that is completely silly.

1565
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:10,418
okay, now here, I mean, we can work out
the, the, the dual function here.

1566
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:12,882
You simply form the [UNKNOWN] which is
this thing and

1567
01:30:12,882 --> 01:30:16,050
then you minimize over x is what happens.

1568
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:16,867
Right?

1569
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:20,524
And you minimize over sorry x and y is a
new introduced variable,

1570
01:30:20,524 --> 01:30:26,330
if you minimize over x this thing is
either minus infinity or it's 0.

1571
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:30,093
If it's minus infinity, if ,if a transpose
new is non 0 right,

1572
01:30:30,093 --> 01:30:33,075
if a transpose new is 0 Then this term
drops out, and

1573
01:30:33,075 --> 01:30:40,458
then you'll recognixe this as related to
the conjugate function of f0, right?

1574
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:43,914
So, again, that's just a calculation, and
you can check on it, and

1575
01:30:43,914 --> 01:30:46,244
all that sort of stuff.

1576
01:30:46,244 --> 01:30:48,107
Okay, so, this is a good example,

1577
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:52,799
where (no period) A transformation before
you apply before you compute a,

1578
01:30:52,799 --> 01:30:59,450
determine a Lagrange dual makes a hu, a
world of difference, right?

1579
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:02,690
So, by the way, what this means is that
while people talk a lot of times and

1580
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:07,755
they say, here's a problem, and then
informally you'd say the dual is this.

1581
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:10,420
And it turns out that's really not quite
right.

1582
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,695
that, that's loose speech, and often,
well, it can mean this, I mean,

1583
01:31:14,695 --> 01:31:22,110
technically when you say the dual is this,
it means you follow the script perfectly.

1584
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:25,542
You simply, you form the Libron gene, you
minimize over the you

1585
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:29,172
minimize over the primal variables to get
a dual function, and

1586
01:31:29,172 --> 01:31:35,010
you maximize that subject to lamda bigger
than equal to 0.

1587
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:36,726
Those are the Lagrange multipliers
associated with

1588
01:31:36,726 --> 01:31:38,090
the inequality constraints.

1589
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:39,267
Right?
That, in some sense,

1590
01:31:39,267 --> 01:31:43,599
that you just turn the crank on Lagrange
duality, that's the dual.

1591
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,816
but people are informal and they will
allow you to do little bit of

1592
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:49,976
transformation before you perform the dual
and

1593
01:31:49,976 --> 01:31:53,054
sometimes a little bit of transformation
after you form the dual and

1594
01:31:53,054 --> 01:31:56,618
this is then a static thing we will often
be in the situatuion where someone will

1595
01:31:56,618 --> 01:31:58,616
say here is the primal and here is the
dual And

1596
01:31:58,616 --> 01:32:06,405
what they really meant to say, maybe, was
here's the primal and here's a dual.

1597
01:32:06,405 --> 01:32:07,480
Right?

1598
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,285
And so, that, by the way you'll notice
that sometimes when you hear

1599
01:32:10,285 --> 01:32:12,530
people attach a name to a dual.

1600
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:17,740
So they'll say here's a quadratic program,
and here is the Franke-Wolfe dual.

1601
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,750
Or here is the, you know, whatever it is,
such and such dual.

1602
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:22,025
Right?
So that, that's your hint.

1603
01:32:22,025 --> 01:32:25,820
That, that they're being a little bit
loose with the idea of a dual.

1604
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:26,760
So, okay.

1605
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:32,243
Alright, let's look at a couple of others.

1606
01:32:32,243 --> 01:32:34,750
Let's take a norm approximation problem.

1607
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:37,470
So you want to minimize the norm of Ax
minus b.

1608
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:42,949
And again we'll introduce an equality
constraint.

1609
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:45,510
so, we'll write this as minimize the norm
of y.

1610
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:51,131
Subject to y equals Ax minus b, where y
and x are now the variables.

1611
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:52,562
By the way, I mean, this, this is,

1612
01:32:52,562 --> 01:32:56,716
we're going to see this again when we
actually solve these problems.

1613
01:32:56,716 --> 01:32:59,108
That you know if you were confronted with
this problem,

1614
01:32:59,108 --> 01:33:03,900
you might have an overwhelming urge
immediately to get rid of y.

1615
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,510
Right?
Because, it's silly.

1616
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:09,044
Why is x minus b, why, why not just plug
that in the top, and I mean, you have a,

1617
01:33:09,044 --> 01:33:14,150
this problem has fewer variables, you
know, all this kinds of stuff.

1618
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:16,721
So you might be tempted to do that.

1619
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:19,385
And in fact, you're training your pencil
and

1620
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:25,480
paper 19th century kind of silly
mathematics education you've had.

1621
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:29,587
Up until probably recently possibly until
now.

1622
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:34,974
But probably, certainly most undergraduate
courses are like that.

1623
01:33:34,974 --> 01:33:37,854
You know, you would of course do that
because, you know, in the pencil and

1624
01:33:37,854 --> 01:33:42,522
paper world or the chalkboard world you
know, that's simpler than that.

1625
01:33:42,522 --> 01:33:46,356
It turns out though that's often not the
case when you're actually either solving

1626
01:33:46,356 --> 01:33:51,235
the problem, we're going to talk about
that in the last third of the course.

1627
01:33:51,235 --> 01:33:54,435
Or in fact even here when you're actually
doing things like forming duels and

1628
01:33:54,435 --> 01:33:56,030
things like that.

1629
01:33:56,030 --> 01:34:00,450
If you're actually better off, sometimes
working at a problem that appears by

1630
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:04,180
19th century asthetic to be more complex.

1631
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,960
You may be better off.

1632
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,050
We'll see why that is later.

1633
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:12,192
Okay, so let's, This thing.

1634
01:34:12,192 --> 01:34:15,213
I mean minimizing a function subject to a
quality constraint is

1635
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:17,620
just a completely uniform dual.

1636
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:20,420
And it's in term, it comes up in terms of
the you can work it

1637
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:25,990
out in completely generally in terms of
the conjugate of the function.

1638
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:27,180
And we'll get to that.

1639
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:28,537
But the conjugate of a norm,

1640
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:32,950
is in fact, indicator function of the dual
norm [UNKNOWN].

1641
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:38,870
And some of these things by the way will
start, should start lodging in your mind.

1642
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:43,693
I mean that you should start building maps
of things, and if,

1643
01:34:43,693 --> 01:34:47,428
if not the exact details.

1644
01:34:47,428 --> 01:34:49,816
Then at least just patterns.

1645
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:51,770
you, you should know these patterns.

1646
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:54,905
So that when you see a, a max in one, you
should expect in the dual to see

1647
01:34:54,905 --> 01:34:59,950
something like a probability distribution,
or something that sums to one.

1648
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:04,460
Right?
So when you see a norm in one.

1649
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:07,760
You should expect to see a dual norm
constraint in the other.

1650
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,188
When you see a norm squared in one,

1651
01:35:09,188 --> 01:35:12,870
you should expect to see a norm, dual norm
squared in the other.

1652
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,970
So, you don't have to [INAUDIBLE] same if
you see an equality constraint in

1653
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:20,410
one with A, you should expect something
involving a transpose in the dual.

1654
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:23,484
So, these are just general patterns You
could always just calculate,

1655
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:27,770
in fact you should probably do that just
to be sure you got it right.

1656
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:32,296
But these are patterns you should start,
I, I, I don't memorise them but

1657
01:35:32,296 --> 01:35:38,310
you should at least start picking up on
these high level patterns.

1658
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:39,130
By the way if you do that,

1659
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:43,590
what's kind of cool is you'll start seeing
them in every other course you take.

1660
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:45,170
Right?
They won't call it the conjucate,

1661
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,890
they won't call it the dual, it'll have
another name.

1662
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:52,430
But you'll look at it and say, I've seen
that, I know what that is right?

1663
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:54,908
That, that's the dual and you'll see it in
you know,

1664
01:35:54,908 --> 01:36:00,438
in your statistic classes, certainly in
economics and, and in lots of classes.

1665
01:36:00,438 --> 01:36:01,510
So okay.

1666
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:05,036
>> So here let's just work out the The
dual and so

1667
01:36:05,036 --> 01:36:12,813
here what you would do is you would you,
you minimize the objective here.

1668
01:36:12,813 --> 01:36:13,341
Plus this is,

1669
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:16,605
you put an equality constraint, a new
transpose times an equality constraint and

1670
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:20,270
that's, that's all of this thing here,
right, written out.

1671
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:24,860
And now we are asked to minimize over x
and y, x is easy, right?

1672
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,195
And we keep using this very simple idea.

1673
01:36:27,195 --> 01:36:30,867
that you know this Lagrangian here is an
alphine function of x and

1674
01:36:30,867 --> 01:36:35,491
as silly as it sounds it is useful to know
how to minimize an alphine function ,very

1675
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:38,823
easy actually,here is the answer minus
infinity right and

1676
01:36:38,823 --> 01:36:45,680
less the linear part of the alphine
function Vanishes, right.

1677
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,510
So, so no problem here.

1678
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:53,150
This says unless this vector, sorry, I
meant to, do these, right.

1679
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,710
Unless A transpose new is zero,

1680
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:58,196
the minimum over x of this thing is minus
infinity.

1681
01:36:58,196 --> 01:36:59,227
Right?

1682
01:36:59,227 --> 01:37:01,084
So, alright.

1683
01:37:01,084 --> 01:37:01,868
So, and then, if,

1684
01:37:01,868 --> 01:37:06,110
assuming A transpose new is zero, then
that term just goes away, right?

1685
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,880
So that tells you that you get something
like this.

1686
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,730
If A transpose new is zero, then you have
the norm of y plus new transpose here.

1687
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,850
Times, and I guess you could write this as
y plus b or something like that.

1688
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:18,519
Whatever it is.

1689
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:21,964
and, oh sorry, this one can just cut, this
side, that's just a constant, and

1690
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:24,202
that can come out here.

1691
01:37:24,202 --> 01:37:25,650
And you end up with something like this.

1692
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:29,370
And whenever you see the [UNKNOWN] of a
convex function plus a linear term,

1693
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:32,750
you can rewrite that as a conjugate,
right.

1694
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,830
Or in this case, we can work it out
directly.

1695
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:40,590
A norm here is a, is homogeneous, so if
you multiply something by three.

1696
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:41,566
It the value is,

1697
01:37:41,566 --> 01:37:45,950
you know, three times the, its, the value
is by a factor of three.

1698
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:49,800
Its homogeneous, so is this, and so what
happens here is,

1699
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:56,649
if, here, Nu is big enough in the dual
norm so that you can make this thing.

1700
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,406
any number if it is negative then i can
make it minus infinity by

1701
01:38:01,406 --> 01:38:02,902
homogenating right and so

1702
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:07,254
it tells you that by this thing here which
is actually related to conjugate of

1703
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:11,402
the norm is simply the indicator function
of dual norm unit wall,right so

1704
01:38:11,402 --> 01:38:15,890
we are going to end up with this And so
the dual of norm approximation problem is

1705
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:21,058
this, is you maximize here b transpose new
subject to A transpose new equals zero and

1706
01:38:21,058 --> 01:38:29,520
new star less than or equal to one, right?

1707
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,920
And so this, that, we're making various
assertions here.

1708
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,330
What we're saying is something like this.

1709
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,894
For this problem, if you find any vector
by any means,

1710
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:44,290
any vector new in the null space of A
transpose Whose dual norm is less than 1.

1711
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:47,860
Then b transpose nyu is a lower bound on
the [INAUDIBLE] of that problem.

1712
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,328
Period, right because that's, that's
assertion number 1.

1713
01:38:50,328 --> 01:38:53,415
Assertion number 2 is our actually is a
value of nyu here for

1714
01:38:53,415 --> 01:38:56,250
which its actually equal to the lower
bound, right and

1715
01:38:56,250 --> 01:39:03,260
in fact by carefully analyzing what would
happen here you can actually recover.

1716
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:06,250
What, partly, you can recover what the
optimal x is,

1717
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,980
if I gave you the optimal mean.

1718
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,880
So this is, this is the, this is the idea.

1719
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,750
Another variation on this is dealing with
implicit constraint.

1720
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:17,530
So that works this way: is that you can.

1721
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:19,869
And oh, there's a name for this sometimes
eh.

1722
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:24,795
Some people call this partial, a partial
LeGrangian and partial dualization.

1723
01:39:24,795 --> 01:39:27,709
so what that says is this,here is my
original problem and

1724
01:39:27,709 --> 01:39:31,491
it doesn't really matter what it is it's a
kind of little linear problem it

1725
01:39:31,491 --> 01:39:35,335
says minimize c transpose x subject
Ax=b,linear quality constraints and

1726
01:39:35,335 --> 01:39:39,303
the constrain that x is in the box so all
the interests of x are between plus and

1727
01:39:39,303 --> 01:39:43,395
minus 1 well if i simply form the dual,i
will get what it looks this,okay fine,no

1728
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:47,363
problem,that's it,but there is an other
way to do this ,what you do is ,what we

1729
01:39:47,363 --> 01:39:51,641
will do is we take these constraints these
are explicit constraints what we will do

1730
01:39:51,641 --> 01:39:55,671
is we will put them implicitly in the
adjective,so i will take this problem and

1731
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:59,143
i will transform into this problem,they
are diffrent problems and

1732
01:39:59,143 --> 01:40:03,359
it is extemely important to understand
These are different problems but they are

1733
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:13,180
equivalent.

1734
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:16,092
In this problem, the only, there's only
one quality constraint and

1735
01:40:16,092 --> 01:40:18,536
the objective is either, c transpose x
plus infinity but

1736
01:40:18,536 --> 01:40:21,864
I've added in this thing here, and so it's
very important to understand that,

1737
01:40:21,864 --> 01:40:26,992
you know, as objects say, you don't have
equals equal here.

1738
01:40:26,992 --> 01:40:28,355
Right?

1739
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:31,547
This one, this problem, if you ask how
many constraints do you have,

1740
01:40:31,547 --> 01:40:33,315
the answers two.

1741
01:40:33,315 --> 01:40:34,851
Right?

1742
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:37,820
If I say how many constraints you have
here, the answers one.

1743
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:41,840
If I ask here is, if I say you know
problem dot objective dot is linear,

1744
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,115
it's true here and it's absolutely false
here.

1745
01:40:46,115 --> 01:40:48,660
Everybody see what I'm talking about?

1746
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:51,359
But they're clearly, completely
equivalent.

1747
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:54,804
In the sense that, you know, an optimal
point here is an optimal point here, and

1748
01:40:54,804 --> 01:40:56,346
vice versa.

1749
01:40:56,346 --> 01:40:56,888
Okay?

1750
01:40:56,888 --> 01:41:00,452
So, it's actually quite important to be
very clear in

1751
01:41:00,452 --> 01:41:06,222
your mind about equivalences, verses,
being the same.

1752
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:09,602
Right so, okay, so these two I mean it's
just really dumb, it's just a dumb way to

1753
01:41:09,602 --> 01:41:14,630
and the only way you would know any
difference would be something like this.

1754
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:18,778
If I were to throw, if I, if I had this
problem and I said problem not eval and

1755
01:41:18,778 --> 01:41:23,960
I threw in an x which was outside the box.

1756
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,340
Here.

1757
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:30,150
I, it would retur, what would be returned
would be something like an error token.

1758
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:33,770
And it would say something like
infeasible, right?

1759
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:37,069
And it would violate this constraint,
right?

1760
01:41:37,069 --> 01:41:40,969
Here, if I give you, if I give you an x
that satisfies a x equals b,

1761
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:45,590
but some x's are bigger than 1 or -1,
right?

1762
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:48,134
And what would happen in this case is I
get a new, I get a new thing,

1763
01:41:48,134 --> 01:41:52,170
I get something back that says it would be
an error just as well.

1764
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:55,410
but it wouldn't be the error your
infeasible in fact I get what would come

1765
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:59,580
back would be a token telling me, oh thank
you, x is feasible.

1766
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:02,325
That's the good news, bad news is it's out
of the domain of the objective or

1767
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:05,750
another way to say it is the objective
values plus infinity.

1768
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,318
And if you're minimizing that's about as
bad as it can get.

1769
01:42:08,318 --> 01:42:11,100
So everybody, fo, following this.

1770
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,053
Right, so it's important to understand
these are different.

1771
01:42:14,053 --> 01:42:17,711
They're different but also when you learn,
you know, when you're kind of in

1772
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:23,125
a situation where people are doing, you
know, street fighting type stuff.

1773
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:25,140
You don't even think about this, right?

1774
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,137
You just quietly do this, or, so.

1775
01:42:27,137 --> 01:42:28,558
oh, so if you take this problem, and

1776
01:42:28,558 --> 01:42:31,351
then you form the dual function here, you
actually have a different,

1777
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:36,490
you don't even have a dual variable
associated with these inequalities.

1778
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,280
Right?
So you just get this.

1779
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,610
The dual function is this but, now this
thing if you like I put it there,but you

1780
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:45,670
really should be an indicator function
over here.

1781
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:46,496
Right?

1782
01:42:46,496 --> 01:42:49,090
Should be an indicator function of the,
the box.

1783
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:50,030
Right?

1784
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:51,156
Like that.

1785
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:54,938
So here it asks you to do this, but
minimizing a linear function an ad-fine

1786
01:42:54,938 --> 01:43:00,845
function [UNKNOWN] trivial we know how to
solve that and you actually get this.

1787
01:43:00,845 --> 01:43:01,566
Right?
And so

1788
01:43:01,566 --> 01:43:06,070
the dual problem after, after this Minor
reformulation is this.

1789
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:09,570
It says that the dual problem of this is
that.

1790
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:12,830
It says maximize this thing and everything
works, right?

1791
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:16,311
Now, fact is if you stare at this long
enough you'll realize that this is

1792
01:43:16,311 --> 01:43:18,446
the same as that.

1793
01:43:18,446 --> 01:43:23,060
so, you know, in this case you do have the
communitive diagram.

1794
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:26,678
The, the p DP prime and P prime, you
actually get a communicative,

1795
01:43:26,678 --> 01:43:32,130
a simple communicative diagram, right, but
it doesn't always happen.

1796
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:33,116
Okay.
So by the way this,

1797
01:43:33,116 --> 01:43:35,968
this thing here is called a partial
legrangian, and, or

1798
01:43:35,968 --> 01:43:38,944
another way people would say what would
happen is you say I

1799
01:43:38,944 --> 01:43:45,368
start with this problem and I'm going to,
I'm going to form, I'm going to dualize...

1800
01:43:45,368 --> 01:43:49,130
Keeping the inequalities implicit.

1801
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:50,870
So that, that would be how people would
say this.

1802
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:53,170
There, there'd be various descriptions for
it.

1803
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:56,891
That's if people are being clear, right?

1804
01:43:56,891 --> 01:43:59,042
Okay.

1805
01:43:59,042 --> 01:44:02,320
Next topic is generalized inequalities.

1806
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,155
So, so far everything in duality has
happened with

1807
01:44:05,155 --> 01:44:07,620
ordinary scalar inequalities.

1808
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:10,623
So, constraint functions return numbers.

1809
01:44:10,623 --> 01:44:16,390
If the number is negative, it's feasible,
if it's positive, infeasible.

1810
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:19,470
But now we'll look at problems with
generalized inequalities.

1811
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:21,882
Right?
So here these are potentially

1812
01:44:21,882 --> 01:44:27,096
vector-valued and the constraint is that
that vector has to be negative, or

1813
01:44:27,096 --> 01:44:33,020
less than or equal to 0 but with respect
to some cone.

1814
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:37,250
And the, the obvious nontrivial case is
the positive semidefinite cone.

1815
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,765
Right?
So that can be a matrix inequality.

1816
01:44:38,765 --> 01:44:40,034
Okay.

1817
01:44:40,034 --> 01:44:44,160
And it turns out all the notation is set
up perfectly.

1818
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,780
This is how you know you have good
notation,

1819
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,130
is that everything looks exactly the same.

1820
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:51,620
You make a few minimal changes, and it's
actually correct.

1821
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:53,660
Right?
So, here what you do is these,

1822
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:59,834
the left and right hand side of that
constraint is a vector, it's an Rk.

1823
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:04,256
KI and so what we'll do is the Lagrange,
the associated Lagrange multiplier dual

1824
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:09,560
layer is a vector, okay, and the
Lagrangian is the obvious thing.

1825
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,980
It's this.
It's the completely obvious inequality,

1826
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,839
that you would have.

1827
01:45:15,839 --> 01:45:18,743
By the way if this was a vector equality,
I mean, that would be fine, you could put

1828
01:45:18,743 --> 01:45:23,212
a transpose right here and, and it would
look exactly the same, so that's it...

1829
01:45:23,212 --> 01:45:28,170
Again, it, it reduces in the case whether
scalar to just what we had before but

1830
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:30,926
here it's a vector.

1831
01:45:30,926 --> 01:45:34,525
Okay, so and the dual function is
absolutely identical, so it's great, so

1832
01:45:34,525 --> 01:45:36,531
it means if you kind of wrote the you
know,

1833
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:40,543
abstract enough software whatever your
Your same thing that would work in the pr,

1834
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:47,330
in the scalar case would just work
absolutely transparently in this case.

1835
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:49,060
Right?
So that, that's good.

1836
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:53,740
Okay, now the lower bound property,
there's one subtlety.

1837
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:56,660
The lower bound property for general dual
is this.

1838
01:45:56,660 --> 01:46:01,660
If lambda is now negative Then g gives you
a lower bound on the primal problem.

1839
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,310
So, these are vectors now, the lambdas.

1840
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:04,990
And it turns out that the correct,

1841
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:09,390
the correct way in which they're
non-negative is in the dual cone.

1842
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:13,200
Now, first of all, you could have guessed
that for many reasons.

1843
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,400
First of all you should've guessed it on
aesthetic grounds.

1844
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,310
And here are the, here are the aesthetic
grounds.

1845
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,855
You're taking the inner product of two
things.

1846
01:46:21,855 --> 01:46:26,489
One is supposed to be negative in one
inequality, in one cone.

1847
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:29,316
Then it actually sort of makes sense, and

1848
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:32,403
if you do sort of the very abstract
mathematics and keep track of like row and

1849
01:46:32,403 --> 01:46:35,392
column vectors and dual spaces and things
like that Then you would be led,

1850
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:39,920
it'd have to be that these thing are in
the dual cone.

1851
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,956
Of course then you can just check because
either these things are going to work out

1852
01:46:42,956 --> 01:46:44,594
or they're not.

1853
01:46:44,594 --> 01:46:47,330
So turns out, that's the subtlety.

1854
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:51,818
Now for the scalar case, the dual cone of
r plus is r plus.

1855
01:46:51,818 --> 01:46:54,980
So we don't see any difference right.

1856
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:58,530
We just say if the inequality holds.

1857
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,703
Then if you have a non negative Lagrange
multipliers, you know,

1858
01:47:00,703 --> 01:47:02,165
that's how that works.

1859
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:03,593
Okay, and to see how this works it,

1860
01:47:03,593 --> 01:47:08,700
the proof is essentially the same, except
that you wouldn't have a transpose there.

1861
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,970
It's, it's quite the same.

1862
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:17,160
It says to take any x that's feasible and
then let's form this Lagrangian like that.

1863
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,100
Well these are zero, so this term just
goes away.

1864
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,762
That's totally irrelevant.

1865
01:47:20,762 --> 01:47:26,320
>> Okay, and now we look at, well we look
at this.

1866
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,344
What ever this is, if what ever this is
for any [INAUDIBLE] this is

1867
01:47:29,344 --> 01:47:32,760
bigger than the dual condition there
right, because the dual function is

1868
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:38,251
the minimum of the [INAUDIBLE], so this is
bigger than that, that's g.

1869
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:40,903
And over here if you look at this, the key
point is that you can,

1870
01:47:40,903 --> 01:47:45,610
you want to conclude that all of those
numbers are less than or equal to 0.

1871
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:48,522
And that's correct because the fact that x
i is feasible says that f i

1872
01:47:48,522 --> 01:47:52,360
of x [UNKNOWN] is less than or equal to 0
in the k i cone.

1873
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:57,102
The inner product of that with a
non-negative in the dual cone,

1874
01:47:57,102 --> 01:48:00,830
that's what gives you that that's less
than or equal to zero.

1875
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,340
So each of these are less than or equal to
zero.

1876
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:02,890
Right?
So

1877
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:05,620
that's the, that's the, that's the key
here.

1878
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,672
So, so it just works.

1879
01:48:06,672 --> 01:48:08,432
Okay.

1880
01:48:08,432 --> 01:48:10,220
So, everything is the same.

1881
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:13,310
Including, by the way, its [UNKNOWN],
condition, and things like that.

1882
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:14,715
Generalize [UNKNOWN], it's all the same.

1883
01:48:14,715 --> 01:48:19,611
Okay, so the most important example of
that is Like SDP, so

1884
01:48:19,611 --> 01:48:22,980
semi definite program.

1885
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:26,560
Semi definite program that looks like
this, this is an inequality form.

1886
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,690
An inequality form you minimize a linear
function subject to what's called a linear

1887
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:34,702
matrix inequality that says that a, a, a
linear sum, a weighted sum of a bunch of

1888
01:48:34,702 --> 01:48:41,390
symmetric matrices should be less than or
equal to another matrix, right.

1889
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,960
And that's in the matrix sense, this
inequality.

1890
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,569
So, that's a, that's a semidefinite
program.

1891
01:48:46,569 --> 01:48:47,466
This is an MLI here.

1892
01:48:47,466 --> 01:48:50,830
And so here, we introduce, we're going to
form the dual.

1893
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:53,946
We, so, we have to form we have to have a,

1894
01:48:53,946 --> 01:48:59,875
a Lagrange multiplier you know something
like a lambda.

1895
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:05,100
But it's a matrix because here let the,
let the right hand arguments are matrix's.

1896
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,293
Right?
So it's going to be a matrix,

1897
01:49:06,293 --> 01:49:07,266
we'll call it Z.

1898
01:49:07,266 --> 01:49:09,290
It's a symmetric matrix.

1899
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:11,769
And the Lagrange is this, it's C transpose
X,

1900
01:49:11,769 --> 01:49:16,660
plus and then the it;s going to be the
inner product of Z.

1901
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,130
And the part that is negative, which is
this thing minus G.

1902
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:21,886
Now, the inner product of two symmetric
matrices is the trace of

1903
01:49:21,886 --> 01:49:23,510
the product, right?

1904
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:26,213
I mean, that's just, that, that's the
inner product of the two

1905
01:49:26,213 --> 01:49:29,690
matrices considered as vectors in rn
squared, right?

1906
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:31,270
It's just the standard inner product.

1907
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:33,406
So, I get this, like that, and

1908
01:49:33,406 --> 01:49:39,500
now we do the same thing As usual, we
minimize over x, right.

1909
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:44,671
This is an affine function of x, so
nothing could be easier, right.

1910
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:48,065
If you minimize an affine function of x,
the answer is minus infinity.

1911
01:49:48,065 --> 01:49:53,930
Unless the linear part of that affine
function vanishes, right.

1912
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,177
So let's look at the linear part, or

1913
01:49:55,177 --> 01:49:57,600
you know I could do this with respect each
x i.

1914
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,975
Let's minimize over x one this expression.

1915
01:49:59,975 --> 01:50:03,010
Well, I get c1 x1 here.

1916
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:07,890
And I get trace z x1f1, but I can take the
x1 out.

1917
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:16,040
And so what I would get is c1 x1 plus, and
then trace zf1.

1918
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,168
That's a number times x1, and

1919
01:50:17,168 --> 01:50:20,500
then plus a whole bunch of crap that
doesn't depend on x1.

1920
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,648
Right?
That's what this Lagrangian looks like,

1921
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:23,340
okay?

1922
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,080
I minimize over x1.

1923
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,540
That's completely trivial.

1924
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:31,400
The only, the only option is that this
plus this has to be zero.

1925
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:32,550
Period, okay?

1926
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:35,286
And that's true for any x1, it's true for
x2, it's true for x3 and so

1927
01:50:35,286 --> 01:50:37,040
what I get is this.

1928
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:42,450
And I, all of these go away and what I'm
left with is trace minus trace zg.

1929
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:43,570
And so I get this.

1930
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:46,559
The dual function is minus trace jz
provided these quality

1931
01:50:46,559 --> 01:50:49,290
constraints hold here.

1932
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:51,728
Otherwise it's minus infinity and I get
the following dual, and

1933
01:50:51,728 --> 01:50:53,170
it looks like that.

1934
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:56,730
It says that, and this is already a bit
loose, but

1935
01:50:56,730 --> 01:51:05,190
it says the dual of this SDP is this, and
actually quite, it's kind of cool...

1936
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,740
This is an inequality form SDP, right?

1937
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:10,500
Because it is minimizable when your
functions of origin is LMI.

1938
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:14,720
Sure enough you get an SDP over here,
which is in equality form, right?

1939
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,709
So in other words that the, the constraint
is that you variable that's not

1940
01:51:17,709 --> 01:51:20,330
negative and then equality constraints.

1941
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:23,762
And these are patterns that should start
looking familiar [INAUDIBLE] linear

1942
01:51:23,762 --> 01:51:25,330
programming, right?

1943
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:28,300
If you have an inequality form linear
program, The dual is a linear

1944
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:31,432
program where the variable is a non
negative quality constraints and

1945
01:51:31,432 --> 01:51:34,140
vice versa, I might add.

1946
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:40,240
So these things should start looking the
same to you, you should see patterns here.

1947
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,782
And you know, by the way, people sometimes
make little tables and cards and

1948
01:51:42,782 --> 01:51:44,914
things like that, you carry in your
wallet, that you know says,

1949
01:51:44,914 --> 01:51:47,625
here's the primal and here's the dual.

1950
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:48,903
I mean that's fine.

1951
01:51:48,903 --> 01:51:53,510
But I think it's enough to just sort of
recognize the patterns.

1952
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:56,219
And then, of course, in any given
particular case, you better be prepared to

1953
01:51:56,219 --> 01:51:59,190
work it out carefully and make sure it's
actually true.

1954
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:00,000
So, okay. So that's it. So that's the
dual.

1955
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,644
And you know this is not obvious.

1956
01:52:00,644 --> 01:52:01,611
I mean, the assertion is not obvious here.

1957
01:52:01,611 --> 01:52:04,300
that, that this is the dual of that.

1958
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:10,176
And if you expand that out into what
you're really saying It's,

1959
01:52:10,176 --> 01:52:15,497
it's not an obvious thing at all.

1960
01:52:15,497 --> 01:52:18,388
These are things that maybe 25 years ago
would have been things that

1961
01:52:18,388 --> 01:52:21,755
basically the vast majority of people
wouldn't know.

1962
01:52:21,755 --> 01:52:25,291
So, it'd be a shocking thing to study this
problem 25 years ago People would say,

1963
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:27,943
you know, you can't, you shouldn't do
that, that's hard to do,

1964
01:52:27,943 --> 01:52:30,543
you can't do that and then, and then say
well here's a duel and

1965
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:33,975
you'd say what do you mean by that, and
you'd say, well, if anything feasible for

1966
01:52:33,975 --> 01:52:41,360
here that gives you a lower bound on that
and it's tight and so on and so forth.

1967
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:45,362
People, it would've been it would've
looked pretty complicated.
