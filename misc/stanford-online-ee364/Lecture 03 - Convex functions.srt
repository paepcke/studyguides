1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,440
Now, we're going to start in on convex
functions.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,050
Well, first of all, the definition is very
simple.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,890
It's this.
It says that a function is convex if its

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,000
domain is convex, and also if it satisfies
this inequality.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Now, this inequality says that if I take a
mixture of two points, so theta's

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,990
between 0 and 1, if I take any mixture of
two points x and y convex combination.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,820
I form theta x plus 1 minus theta y.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,124
I evaluate f there, that's less than or

9
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:34,270
equal to the same convex combination of
the values of f, right.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,620
Evaluate at the end-points.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,985
Or another way to say it geometrically is
if you have the graph of f,

12
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,780
that's, that's this thing.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,300
That's the graph of f.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,948
It says that the chord, some people call
it that, that's a very old term for

15
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:50,180
the line segment in the graph space that
goes from x, f of x to y, f of y.

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,570
It says that the chord, and this chord is
parametrized this point right here.

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,580
It says that f y is below, the graph of f
y is below its chord.

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,260
So that, that, that would be the very old
way to talk about convexity.

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,197
A function is concave if minus f is
convex.

20
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:12,048
And it's called strictly convex.

21
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:13,920
If it is a convex function.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,325
And if this inequality here holds
strictly,

23
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,060
as long as theta is not zero or 1.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,490
Well, of course, a theta zero one it
cannot hold strictly.

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,561
Right?
But when, for

26
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,480
theta in between, it holds strictly.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,734
Right.
So that says that it's,

28
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:30,570
there's actually a gap between the
function and this chord.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,435
The function graph and, and the chord.

30
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:33,870
Okay.

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,300
So let's look at some examples.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,610
Well, we'll look first at just functions
on R just to make it simple.

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,324
You, by the way, you could just plot these
at truly or

34
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:46,076
virtually and just look in, you know, use
your.

35
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:48,290
Use your eyeball to look at these things.

36
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,760
The important point here is convexity
means non-negative curvature.

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,170
It means it curves up.

38
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,760
Okay.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,430
So affine.

40
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,270
Well, an affine function, the graph looks
like that.

41
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,070
I mean, it's got zero curviture.

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,710
So these are, these are of course convex.

43
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,555
Oh, and by the way,.

44
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:08,150
Affine is right where you get an equals
there, right.

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,880
So affine say's you get equals here for
all theta.

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,110
Not just theta between 0 and 1.

47
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,610
Okay?
So in

48
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,135
some sense affine functions are right on
the boundary of convexity.

49
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,029
So, okay.

50
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:23,092
Exponential, well these look either like
that or like that, right?

51
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,770
This is if a is positive.

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,710
That is if a is negative, these are
convex.

53
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,175
The curvature is positive.

54
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:32,050
Powers well this again you can figure this
out.

55
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,470
If alpha is bigger than one, this is on
our plus, so if it's bigger than one

56
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,250
that would be a power, that's like to the
1.1 or something or 1.5.

57
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,830
The square, you know what that looks like.

58
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,490
The cube.

59
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,040
These things get, actually more and more
convex.

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,282
They curve more, they have more and more
curvature.

61
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:49,720
But it's also true for alpha less than
zero.

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,440
So for example 1 over x is going to be
also convex.

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,360
Right?
That looks like this.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,133
Right? Oh. And we should be careful here.

65
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:04,950
Because when I say one over X, I have to
say that the domain.

66
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,210
If this is F, I have to say the domain is
R plus, plus.

67
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,120
Alright, because.

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,192
So there's a distinction between sort of
informal kind of

69
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:17,295
high school Algebra writing 1 over x.

70
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,850
Right.

71
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,990
And what you really mean.

72
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,654
So when, usually when we say one over x,

73
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:25,034
and we'll see this for several other
functions, we mean a different function,

74
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,690
we mean one that's not defined for x
negative.

75
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,970
Whereas of course one over x is quite well
defined for x negative.

76
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,630
So, okay.

77
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,102
What can you say about one over x for x
negative.

78
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:40,030
Convex, concave?

79
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,285
>> Concave.
>> It's concave, so, okay.

80
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,788
Powers of absolute value, I mean again
these are kind of obvious.

81
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,860
Negative entropy, that's something that
looks like this.

82
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,780
It's got infinitely sharp there and then
goes up like that, okay?

83
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,865
And it's convex.

84
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,618
Alright.

85
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:56,100
concave, well affine, because they're
both.

86
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,486
In fact, affine is another way to say
you're both convex and concave.

87
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:05,040
Powers between zero and one, square root
for example, is is going to be concave.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,400
And the log is a, is a, is an, these are
very obvious concave functions.

89
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,589
By the way, the picture here is something
like this: You're going to build up

90
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:19,490
a family of basic functions that you know
to be convex and concave.

91
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,380
Most will be kind of obvious, like this.

92
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,017
Some will be less obvious.

93
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:26,153
And then you're going to, we're going to
work out a calculus of convex functions so

94
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:30,345
you'll be able to combine them in various
ways and things like that.

95
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:35,601
And actually, just a couple of these
things and you'll be quite you'll actually

96
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:42,350
be quite effective at sort of detecting
convexity or establishing convexity.

97
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,521
So, okay.
Let's look at some functions on Rn.

98
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:50,424
here, a general affine function, that's
box convex and and concave norm.

99
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:54,700
So any norm is convex, okay?

100
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,280
So, any norm is convex.

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,590
So that's things like the one norm, the
two norm, infinity norm, you know?

102
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,326
Three norm, doesn't matter.

103
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,534
Any other norm is convex.

104
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,250
And then we can look at examples on
matrices.

105
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,686
So here's a add find function.

106
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:13,850
The general inter product on m by n
matrices.

107
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,735
Is simply trace a transpose x so

108
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:21,480
this when you see this, this here by the
was some people even write it this way.

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,900
Right you can write it that way or other
people write it this way.

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,848
Its basically the generic standard inner
product so

111
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:32,040
when you see trace a transpose x or a
transpose b.

112
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,320
It's the inner product of a and b, right?

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,115
So that's what it, I mean, here, here's
another method you might write this as,

114
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,400
is I find this a bit weird, but okay.

115
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,930
Something like that.

116
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,082
I mean, this is kind of mixing weird
notation, but that's it, okay?

117
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:44,927
So, alright, so

118
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:50,065
an affine function of matrices is trace
something and then plus a constant.

119
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,000
Here's one.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
The maximum singular value.

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
So, well, it's a norm.

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,150
So of course all norms are convex so
maximum singular value is.

123
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,972
Right?
So, by the way,

124
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,530
that's not a simple function.

125
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,000
The, the maximum singular value.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,537
Right?
It's, it's quite complicated.

127
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,329
For example, to actually evaluate it,

128
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,330
I mean, in principle you would form a
characteristic polynomial.

129
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,050
You'd factor that.

130
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,351
You'd look at its roots, and you'd take
the largest Among all the roots,

131
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:20,171
you take the largest one, and then you
take the square root of that or something.

132
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:25,404
So this is not a simple function.

133
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:30,436
So, and yet we know it's convex.

134
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,002
Okay.
So

135
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:35,850
this is, this is one of the tricks you
need to know about.

136
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,525
It's this.
If you have a convex function,

137
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,859
from R on n into R.

138
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,746
And sorry.
If you have a function then you can

139
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,340
restrict it to a line.

140
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,115
Now a line is given by x plus tv,

141
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:52,130
x is something, you know, you might call
that the base point.

142
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,230
You might call v the direction of the
line.

143
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,880
And t is a parameter.

144
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Right, so T as in R and it tells you where
you are on the line.

145
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Oh and I should say V has to be non zero.

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,810
It doesn't give you a line.

147
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,940
So x plus t v.

148
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,396
This is the free parameter representation
of a line where x plus t

149
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:10,032
is a parameter that's real.

150
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:16,788
Okay, so this says evaluate f at the point
on the line parameterized by t, right?

151
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:22,798
And I'm going to define that to be g of t
So that's a function from r to r.

152
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:23,921
Right?

153
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:27,020
And so, here's what, here's, here's what
the result is.

154
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,380
And this is not too hard.

155
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,190
But it says the following.

156
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,450
A function is convex if and only if.

157
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,672
When it's restricted to all lines, it's
convex.

158
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:34,472
Okay?

159
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:36,850
Now, in principle, this is quite useful.

160
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,939
Because, oh, let, let me ask this.

161
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,700
How do you, how do you determine if a
function from r to r is convex..

162
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,290
Yeah.
You plot it,

163
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,120
and, and you looked with your eyeball.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,162
Does it curve up or down?

165
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:50,955
Or both right and if it curves up then you
say well its convex.

166
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:54,135
OK, by the way what you do then is you
back off an dyou go to some other fancy

167
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:58,700
method like you differentiate it twice and
prove some inequality.

168
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,736
And then you destroy evidence that you
actually plotted it but

169
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,260
the correct thing to do is to plot it.

170
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,756
Okay, so that, that, that's how you use
this.

171
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:07,486
Okay?

172
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:12,578
So alright, what this says is in principal
you can detect if a function is convex,

173
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:17,220
a function of RN by simply taking all
lines.

174
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,848
Now of course, you can not really do that,
but

175
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,092
this does tell you, this gives you a
perfectly good method for

176
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,139
checking if a function is convex and I
will tell you what it is.

177
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,430
So here's what it is.

178
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,450
First, you might try some analytical
tools.

179
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,377
You know, you might differentiate
something twice, but

180
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,468
after the formulas grow to the size of a
page you might quit, or

181
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:35,293
something like that.

182
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,660
Then what you do is this.

183
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,730
You write a simple little program to
generate random lines.

184
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,510
Right?
Then do effectively do the same as plot.

185
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,580
Just evaluate the function at a hundred
points along the line.

186
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,960
And check the inequality, just to check
that it always curves up.

187
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
Right?
By the way, if it,

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,580
if you ever find a point where it doesn't,
you're done.

189
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,152
Because you,

190
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:58,389
you've produced two points where the
inequality defining convexity is violated.

191
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,593
In which case, the you are done and

192
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:02,545
it's absolutely no one's business how you
found this point.

193
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,000
Everyone realize?

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,655
So what you do now is you go to lunch.

195
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:07,860
>> Is everyone following, is everyone
following this?

196
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,640
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

197
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,450
You go to lunch.

198
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,960
And you come back after lunch.

199
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,840
If in fact it is terminated, and bounded
by two points, then you walk down

200
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,960
the hall to your colleague who asked
whether the function is convex.

201
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,342
You go, obviously not.

202
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,600
>> [LAUGH] And they say why.

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
And you say, well look at this point here.

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,916
And you, you, you give x and y and

205
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,630
the convex combination, which violates the
inequality, and you go, I,

206
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,302
I don't even really know why you would
think that was convex in the first place.

207
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:34,630
>> [LAUGH] Everyone see what I'm saying?

208
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,800
And then they'd say, well, how the hell
did you come up with these things?

209
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,020
And you'd say, I don't know, it seems kind
of obvious to me.

210
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,296
I don't...

211
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,530
>> [LAUGH] So, okay.
Does this, everyone following this?

212
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,505
Okay, now that's the def, the,

213
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:51,680
the other outcome is that actually it
hasn't been violated.

214
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,690
Now, you don't know for sure it's convex.

215
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,390
But you went out for lunch and you fired
this up, depends on maybe you used

216
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,200
a cluster, maybe, maybe you fired up
something on EC2, I don't know.

217
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,060
But, a fair number of points may have been
checked by now.

218
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,865
Now you don't know if it's convex or not.

219
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,650
Okay.

220
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,180
So now I can actually tell you several
ways to move forward.

221
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,570
The first is, you then try to prove it's
convex.

222
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,340
That, that would be, that's the simplest
way.

223
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,366
And if you do prove it,

224
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:21,110
you destroy all evidence that you ever
tried to establish it empirically.

225
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,350
Everybody understand this?

226
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,311
Okay, so then, now the other thing is you
can still get credit for

227
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,320
it even if you can't prove it's convex.

228
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,605
You go to the next conference.

229
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:31,280
And you say, well, I think the log and the
detection probability.

230
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,940
It seems to be like it's gotta be concave.

231
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,700
Is that, and you just drop that around.

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,290
You say it obvious places, and things like
that.

233
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,732
And then the next year, some smart young
researcher will prove it.

234
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:42,825
>> [LAUGH].
>> And if you're really lucky,

235
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:47,020
they'll have attached your name to it, and
call it the such and such conjecture.

236
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,400
Everyone following this?

237
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,720
>> And then people would say, how did you
know?

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,020
It, it the proof is very complicated
there's all sort of algebraic geomerty and

239
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,170
all sorts of other stuff how could you
have possibly known it was concave and

240
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,445
then you look straight at them and you say
intuition.

241
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:05,328
[LAUGH] Is everyone following this?

242
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:11,120
Okay, so these are advanced methods for
establishing convexity [LAUGH].

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,252
Well we'll talk more about these as the
course goes on, okay?

244
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:18,490
Alright so let's do one, like that.

245
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,082
By the way if you do these things just
don't tell anyone where you learned them,

246
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:22,980
[LAUGH] so, because I'll deny it.

247
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,050
So okay so let's look, let's look at an
example.

248
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,856
Here's a very famous one it's kind of one
of the first functions that's not

249
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,340
obviously convex.

250
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,545
It's log of a determinate.

251
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:34,710
Right?

252
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, that's not.

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,030
By the way, these two thing, these two
symbols go together.

254
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,300
It depends on what courses you've taken.

255
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,368
But, for example, you would recognize this
as related to the entropy of

256
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,950
a Gaussian random variable, where x is the
co-variance.

257
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,570
I mean.
So you

258
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,574
probably have seen log determinants
sitting next to each other before maybe.

259
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:54,662
Okay.
Maybe you have.

260
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:55,750
Maybe you haven't.

261
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,722
But the idea is there,

262
00:11:56,722 --> 00:12:00,578
there are a lot of areas where they fit
very comfortable together.

263
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:04,970
And it turns out log determinant of a
matrix is concave.

264
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,210
For a positive definite matrix.

265
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,317
Just a fact.

266
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,430
I mean, later, this will be completely
obvious.

267
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,790
We'll get to it.

268
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,969
By the way, it would be kind of a pain in
the ass to show this via a direct proof.

269
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,700
Although if you've taken information
theory.

270
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
and, and.

271
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,630
For some reason think that, that's simpler
than sort of basic inequalities.

272
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,958
Then you'd say oh that follows because
entropies some mixture something and

273
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,882
you say something and some theorem from,

274
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:35,600
from information theory would tell us
immediately that this concave.

275
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Okay, its a mixture of Gaussian I don't
know what it is anyway, okay?

276
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,202
So let's check this though.

277
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:41,652
So how do you check it?

278
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,930
Well, what we'll do is we'll form an
arbitrary line.

279
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,230
So, what does a line in matrix space look
like?

280
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,720
In symmetric matrix space.

281
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,440
Well, it looks like this.

282
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
It's got a base point, X, and it's got a
direction, V.

283
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,938
Now, X we can assume without a loss of
generality is positive-definite.

284
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:59,006
because this line has to intersect the
non, the positive-definite dom,

285
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,674
it has to right, otherwise there's nothing
to show, right?

286
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:03,974
So it has to intersect right so

287
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:07,436
we might as well say it intersects when t
equals 0, right?

288
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:10,610
So we can assume without lost generality
that x is positive.

289
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,525
And then v is merely symmetric, so x plus
t v is really a line.

290
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:20,660
And if you want to, you can think of it as
a line of potential covariance matrices.

291
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,430
So that's what it is.

292
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,810
So it is parametarized by t.

293
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,166
Now, for an interval of t, for some values
of t,

294
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:30,510
it is possible there is an interval where
that thing is positive definite.

295
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,450
But there is, it is possible if you make t
big enough one way or the other.

296
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,430
It is possible.

297
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,050
In fact that, that matrix will become not
positive definite.

298
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,490
So there may be an interval of little t.

299
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,100
Over which, X plus tV is positive
definite.

300
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,810
So this, the, is there, positive definite
matrices?

301
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,623
There's a line and it may intersect it at,

302
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:51,650
now you can have weird things where it
intersects at, at only one point.

303
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,670
It's a half open interval but you know,
but that would happen for example.

304
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,350
If v is positive-semidefinite, the
direction.

305
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,980
Okay so let's, now let's look at this on a
line.

306
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,150
Well on a line, this thing is log det.

307
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,174
I'm going to, I'm going to expand, I'm
going to write this as,

308
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,474
I'm going to do this, I can/g, there's
several ways to do it, but

309
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,580
I can write, I can pull out x one half.

310
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,145
On either side of this thing, and

311
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:20,820
write this, i plus t is x minus half v, x
minus half, and x one half.

312
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,390
So, certainly, this, this matrix is surely
the same as that, here.

313
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,340
Right?

314
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,900
And now I take the determinant of that.

315
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,840
It's the triple product of the
determinants, you get, and log is the sum,

316
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,290
so I get log det, I get one half log det x
plus one half log det x,

317
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,875
that's this one, this one, and this one.

318
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,879
Okay.

319
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,955
That's a constant and doesn't interest me
as far as convexity is concerned.

320
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,710
Now we look at this thing.

321
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,480
So what it says is something like this.

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,752
Without loss of generality,

323
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:53,505
I can concentrate on the case where my
base point is the identity.

324
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:54,177
Okay, but

325
00:14:54,177 --> 00:15:00,820
log of det of i plus something, we know
the eigenvalues of this matrix right?

326
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,785
The eigenvalues of that matrix are exactly
1 plus t lambda i where lambda i

327
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,571
are the eigenvalues of this matrix, right?

328
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,796
So and in fact the that tells you that the
log determinant is the sum of log plus t

329
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,121
lambda i.

330
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:17,560
and, guess what?

331
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,400
This function is concave and you can just
check that again.

332
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,502
My claim is that for

333
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:28,420
a variable for something with one
variable, you can just check, right?

334
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,099
That log of 1 plus t lambda depends on the
sign of lambda i,

335
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,850
which can be positive or negative.

336
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,686
But either way this thing is concave,

337
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,620
because log of something affine is
concave, right?

338
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,810
So, that's it.

339
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,190
So we're, we're done.

340
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,325
By the way, these lambda i's they might
look mysterious here, but

341
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:47,955
if you know, if you had an advanced course
on linear algebra or maybe you took

342
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:54,250
a mechanics course, these are actually the
generalized eigenvalues of the pair, x v.

343
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,835
Right, so if you've, if you've, if you
trained in these areas, you,

344
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,542
this, this does not look mysterious at
all.

345
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,645
OK.
So, there we go.

346
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:06,063
By the way, this has been known about a
hundred years,

347
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:12,480
the fact that the log determinant is is
concave.

348
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,004
OK, now there's a one, one other thing
we're going to cover is this.

349
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:18,692
It turns out when you're dealing with
convex or concave functions,

350
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,668
there's a very nice way that you can
actually pull in the idea of the domain,

351
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:24,700
and, and define things over.

352
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,450
A bigger extended have extended values.

353
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,274
So what you could do is you take a normal
function F, which has domain F.

354
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:35,731
And has value when you're in the domain F,
F of x,

355
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:39,065
at if x is in the domain, if the value.

356
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,070
So, and for an ordinary function.

357
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,675
If I call f outside the domain.

358
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:48,020
what, I mean, well, what I should get.

359
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,150
Is, what should be returned to me, an
exception should be thrown.

360
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,078
And the exception thrown should be
something, should be a token like OOD,

361
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,020
which means out of domain.

362
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,509
Which means I have no intention of, of, of
evaluating f out there.

363
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:04,710
Because, you're not, it's not in the valid
domain.

364
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,580
Right, so that, that's, so you should get
something like that.

365
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,150
But you can actually modify things and do
the following.

366
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,340
What you do is f tilde is the
extended-value extension.

367
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,390
What you do is, it's the same as whenever
x is in the domain, it's just f.

368
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,020
But when you're outside the domain, you
assign the value plus infinity.

369
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,882
And it'll turn out, everything's going to
work,

370
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,050
included, including like inequalities and
various things.

371
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,842
It's all just going to work automatically.

372
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,934
Right?

373
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:32,221
So in some sense it's not a whole lot
different, right?

374
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:37,920
And if you think of a return value of plus
infinity as an exception then well okay.

375
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,376
Then whether or not you get the exception
OD, for out of domain, or

376
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:45,280
plus infinity, I guess doesn't matter
much.

377
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,982
But what's nice about it is If you think
of it,

378
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,018
not as an exception, but as an extended
value, all sorts of inequalities and

379
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:53,068
things like that will just work, right.

380
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,986
So this is the extended value extension.

381
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:01,360
And it simplifies notation, right, so for
example this holds now for any x and y.

382
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,218
And you can sort of just check.

383
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:04,350
And there's a couple of rules.

384
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,946
There are a few things that are not
well-defined,

385
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:09,560
in extended arithmetic, obviously.

386
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,474
Well, zero times infinity is not
well-defined.

387
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:13,746
But all, everything else is,

388
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:18,655
the inequalities, everything, everything's
well defined here, and, and just works.

389
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:22,820
Okay, so this is the extended value
extension.

390
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,181
This will also come up a bunch of times.

391
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:32,538
Okay, now we get to sort of first order
conditions for convexity.

392
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:37,210
Well, the, if F's differentiable that
means its domain is open.

393
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,620
And it has a gradient.

394
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,410
These partial derivatives exist at point
okay.

395
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,170
By the way this constructor here which is
a parenthesis with a middle.

396
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,500
It's more compact.

397
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:58,769
Right so this is a column factor that
actually looks like this right?

398
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,190
Like that.

399
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,818
That's the same is that and

400
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:07,570
the first order condition is actually
really interesting.

401
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,260
It's one of the most important tings.

402
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,380
It's actually the one thing which kind of
tells you everything.

403
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,890
It's this.

404
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:21,612
This function here, that is the that is
the first ordered tailored function of F.

405
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,920
At the point x.

406
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,530
Right?
So the y is the variable here.

407
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,690
That's an affine function of y, this what
I've, what I've ident, this thing.

408
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,970
It's an affine function of y.

409
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,410
It's the first-order Taylor expansion of f
at x.

410
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,050
Okay?

411
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,480
So if this is f, right?

412
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,840
Here is This first ordered tailored.

413
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,350
That's this function.

414
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,066
Here is this function y okay.

415
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:49,680
Here's what calculus tells you is the
following.

416
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,679
This function is really close to F if you
are close to x.

417
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,450
It means that you are close to x this
function is close squared.

418
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,120
The f.

419
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,850
That's what calculus tells you.

420
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,310
Right, that that's the whole thing.

421
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,050
What this says instead the assertion here
is a global inequality.

422
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:18,088
It basically says the function is bigger
everywhere, globally.

423
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:22,350
Than the first-order tailor series
expansion, right.

424
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,470
And so this is your first hint that what
you are seeing is not calculus.

425
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,176
It's some weird, sick, global, and
asymetric thing.

426
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,760
We have a different animal here.

427
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,832
The first thing is it is a inequality,
right,

428
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,700
that's the first difference with calculus.

429
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Calculus is just, you know, above, below,
you only have the concept of close.

430
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,620
And it's symmetric.

431
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,475
You can be above, below, you're close.

432
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,520
Right?

433
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,010
And it's weird and local and asymptotic.

434
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,920
This, there are no conditions here.

435
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,740
This is just, it's it's a global
inequality.

436
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,475
Just looks like that.

437
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,510
Okay?

438
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,052
So, that's it.
So,

439
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,520
this is actually very important, actually.

440
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,768
This is also going to come up later in the
class you're going to be

441
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,300
doing convex optimization.

442
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,571
You'll be doing, you'll be solving, I
don't know,

443
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,560
some problem with a thousand variables, I
don't know.

444
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,710
And you'll be And someone will come along
and say what are you doing?

445
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm solving this problem.

446
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,010
And you'd say here's the solution, and
they'd say oh,

447
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,620
well how do you know that's the solution?

448
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,100
You go oh no it is.

449
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,650
I mean that's, no one can do better.

450
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,400
But R 1000 is a giant place, right,
there's a lot, that's a huge thing.

451
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,060
You can't possibly go to lunch and check
other points and come back later and say.

452
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,890
I checked a million points.

453
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,590
You know, and our one thousand, that's
like zero.

454
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,130
Okay, so you know nothing.

455
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,980
That is all I'm saying.

456
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,680
So someone can reasonably say, how do you
know?

457
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,800
How could you possibly assert that this is
the best, that no one can do any better?

458
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,430
In such, in such a giant place?

459
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,428
And the answer will be this inequality
here.

460
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:49,148
That's it, that's the whole, the whole
thing is constructed on the basis of

461
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:54,260
global asymmetric, well asymmetric in an
inequality, that's what it is.

462
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,160
Okay, second order conditions.

463
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,930
Well if a function is twice differentiable
that means it's, it's got,

464
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:05,710
all these partial derivatives exist and
they're That's denoted the Hessian.

465
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,199
So, sometimes written this way, right?

466
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,730
of, of the function at that point.

467
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,248
And what it says is the following.

468
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,880
If, if f.

469
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,560
It says that f is convex, if and only if
its second derivative is non negative.

470
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,370
Now that's a matrix.

471
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,030
So that means positive semi definite,
okay?

472
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,160
So that's the, that's the condition.

473
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,286
Now, it turns out there's a weird
asymmetry here.

474
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,806
If a function, if the second derivative or

475
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:35,152
hessian is positive definite, that's not
enough to guarantee.

476
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:35,800
sorry.

477
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,380
That guarantees straight convexity, but
the other way around is actually false.

478
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,772
You can be strictly convex without having
the hessian, positive, for

479
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,880
all points in the domain.

480
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,650
Okay?

481
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,280
So, I mean, and there are things you can
say about that, but that's good enough.

482
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,780
So that's it.

483
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,500
So that's another way to say it is, again
The second order expansion.

484
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,725
When you get that second, that second
term, that second term is in fact the,

485
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:01,110
the matrix is positive-semidefinite.

486
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,920
Okay so let's look at some examples.

487
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,890
Let's knock off all quadratic functions.

488
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,300
Here's a quadratic function.

489
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,084
Without loss of generality we can assume
that p here is

490
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:16,240
positive-semidefinite symmetric, sorry
symmetric.

491
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,470
Right, because, and otherwise you get the
same quadratic form.

492
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,570
The gradient of this function is PX plus
Q, right?

493
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,930
And the heshin is P.

494
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay?
So that's the, that, that's the heshin.

495
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,144
And it's really simple.

496
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:35,823
The quadratic function is convex if and
only if its quadratic part.

497
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:38,160
Is positive semi-definite.

498
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,340
Okay.
So here's an example.

499
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,560
Is the score subjective?

500
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,980
So let's take F of X is AX minus B norm
squared.

501
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,730
Well the gradient, is, and you can put a
one half there, you know, for aesthetics.

502
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,010
I mean, it doesn't make any difference.

503
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,879
And people often do, for aesthetics.

504
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,490
The aesthetics is the following.

505
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,958
That you don't get this 2, and you don't
get this 2.

506
00:23:55,958 --> 00:24:01,260
Right so, well the gradient is a transpose
ax minus b.

507
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,760
And the hessian is simply its constant its
a transpose a.

508
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,975
But that's always positive semi-definite
so you're done.

509
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:11,135
OK, and here is I think probably the
simplest function well we've already seen

510
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:16,902
log that, that wasn't obvious but this is
sort of a really simple function.

511
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:19,340
And its the first one most people don't
know.

512
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,060
Is convex.

513
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,100
Its really simple function its x squared
over y.

514
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,135
And its a function of two variables x and
y and

515
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:27,920
the domain is y has to be positive OK.

516
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,650
And here's a plot of it so there, there,
there's the plot.

517
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,275
By the way you've seen that plot actually
twice before I claim.

518
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,820
Weirdly.

519
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,860
The first is I, you saw it when we
plotted,

520
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,870
when I gave you a plot of the positive
semidefinite cone in 2 variables.

521
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,831
Right, and I think that I mumbled
something incoherently about

522
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,415
somebody telling me once it looks like the
front of a ship.

523
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:51,690
Okay?

524
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,418
I also said that if you took that thing
and rotated it,

525
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:59,300
it's actually the same as the Lorentz
cone, it the cone.

526
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,980
Right, so that's a lot of mileage from one
stupid cone, right.

527
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,372
It's come up three times, but the point is
it's the graph of x squared over y is,

528
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,289
is this thing.

529
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,438
And it turns out now, you, you can verify
many things, but

530
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:15,239
you just work out what the, the Hessian
is.

531
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,690
I mean, this is kind of high school
calculus.

532
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,870
So you work out what the Hessian is, and
sure enough the Hessian has this form.

533
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,258
It's rank one, but it's positive
semi-definite, 'kay?

534
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,218
And you get that, so

535
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:30,380
that tells you, and in fact it even tells
you a lot, the fact that it's rank one.

536
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,735
The fact that it's rank one tells you that
at any point on that surface it's

537
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:37,445
sort of curving in one direction, but not
the other.

538
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,050
Alright, so that's what it says.

539
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,260
In one direction, it's flat.

540
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,160
In the other direction, it's got positive
curvature.

541
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,120
So x squared over y is convex.

542
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,110
By the way, we're going to see lots of.

543
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,260
Implications of this.

544
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,416
Right, this is going to come up in like
robust statistics, and

545
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,080
all sorts of other things.

546
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,070
It's going to come up a lot.

547
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,172
You'll see.

548
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:58,180
OK, here's one.

549
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,500
It's log sum exp, and

550
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,520
what it is is you take the log of the sum
of a bunch of exponentials.

551
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,580
And before we get into it.

552
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,052
I want to give you a rough idea of what
this function is because it's going to

553
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:13,748
play a big role and the bunch of stuff we,
you probably have seen before, will see

554
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:20,167
again if you've taken the right courses
anyway and will see also in this course.

555
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,680
So here's what log-sum-exp is.

556
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,700
So, first of all it's the power combining
formula in Electro engineering.

557
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,403
In decibals right so again so this I'm
going to go into dialect so

558
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:35,007
those of you not in electrical engineering
I apologize formally but thats okay so

559
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:37,640
I'll go into dialect.

560
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,250
So if I tell you that you have a bunch of
signals coming in you know one at

561
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,060
plus five dbm one at minus twelve one at
this or what something.

562
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,875
And I say what's the total power.

563
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,602
Incident there.

564
00:26:47,602 --> 00:26:50,464
What you would do is -- each of these are
decibels, for the rest of

565
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:55,320
you who don't speak this dialect -- is a
log of a power level, right?

566
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,330
So, so if you want to convert these to
powers, you form an exp.

567
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,120
I mean, there are some, y'know, factors in
there, but I don't care about them.

568
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,470
So you form an exp.

569
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,410
Then you add the powers.

570
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,040
Now we're at the sum exp.

571
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,070
We're up to here, right.

572
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,820
And then the log reconverts back to
decimals.

573
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,205
Okay, so, so my claim is that everyone at
ee knows this it's the db

574
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:18,740
combining formula.

575
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,620
So don't, don't pretend like you haven't
seen it, you have seen it if you're in ee.

576
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,275
The second thing is this is a smooth
approximation of a maximum.

577
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:31,660
Okay and in fact another name for this
function is soft max okay?

578
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,920
So that 's that.

579
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,390
You may have seen in maybe machine
learning course It's a soft.

580
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,360
Is that what it's called in a machines
learning class.

581
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,650
Okay good.

582
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,370
And the intuition is really simple.

583
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,458
It's this.
If I got a bunch of exponentials,

584
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:51,680
the exponential is going to actually
accentuate.

585
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,370
Large numbers.

586
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,640
Like, if one or two numbers are much
bigger than the others.

587
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,200
Their exp, their exps are much bigger than
the exponentials of the others, right?

588
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,130
You add 'em up, and the big ones dominate.

589
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,615
You take the log.

590
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,670
And you get something.

591
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,240
So it's like a soft approximation of the
max, right?

592
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,080
So that's another name for the soft max.

593
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,500
And it's also normalizing function in
statistical mechanics for something.

594
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,190
And it comes up in lots of other things
too.

595
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,230
But maybe not quite with this notation.

596
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,870
Okay.

597
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,402
So this is convex.

598
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:23,230
and, again, the way to show that is to
work out the proof.

599
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,450
And then to write it this way.

600
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,650
Now, unfortunately, the proof was either
going to be shorter or a bit longer.

601
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,730
It's going to, it's, it's not totally
simple.

602
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,555
Because this one is positive semi
definite, clearly.

603
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:37,920
Unfortunately, that said, that goes the
wrong way.

604
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,970
It's minus, right?

605
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,850
So you actually have to do some work to
show this is positive semi definite.

606
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,890
And to do that.

607
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,420
You really have to show that this thing
here is, is positive semi-definite.

608
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,850
So you form something like v transpose
times the Hessian times v,

609
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,690
and you argue that that thing is bigger
than or equal to zero for all v.

610
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,240
And you might do that this way.

611
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,220
You might use Cauchy-Schwarz right, so

612
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,500
Cauchy-Schwarz would tell you this
inequality.

613
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,636
Right, that, that would be the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied.

614
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:10,090
2 square root, well, to square root zk and
square zk vk, right?

615
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,400
The, the two vectors, you plug
Cauchy-Schwarz and

616
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,611
you get exactly this, right?

617
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:19,110
And that tells you up here that this thing
is bigger or equal to 0.

618
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,746
So, so.
And, by the way,

619
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:22,270
I'm not going to go into, you're not
suppose to be getting this in real time.

620
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,610
You have to go out to quiet place.

621
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,310
Check that you believe all these things
and so on.

622
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,066
So, okay.

623
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,220
Geometric mean.

624
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,090
So the nth root of the product of a bunch
of positive numbers.

625
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,083
Well, or, or none negative for that
matter.

626
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,325
That's concave.

627
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,410
And it's the same kind of thing.

628
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,820
In fact, it turns out that the, you know?

629
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,360
For a function like that, and for many
functions like this, it turns out.

630
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,170
That the Hessian is non-negative diagonal
minus rank one.

631
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,630
That's what this is, and you get the same,
same type of argument holds.

632
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,360
Okay, so what's the connection between
convex sets and convex functions?

633
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,820
And that's this, it's through a simple
thing called the epigraph,.

634
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,580
So we'll encounter a whole bunch of
things.

635
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,950
One relating sets and functions.

636
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,258
So here's one.

637
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:18,030
If I have a function, then it's alpha
sublevel set,

638
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,800
is this, it's the set of points in the
domain.

639
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,360
Although, of course if you used extended
value that happens automatically.

640
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,275
Where f is less than alpha.

641
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:30,960
Okay that is the sub level set.

642
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,770
By the way this will have all sorts of
practical meanings when we get into this.

643
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,850
If F is an objective that you want to
minimize than the alpha sub level set

644
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,618
are the set of points designs or

645
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:46,700
choices whatever the x represents, which
are at least as good as alpha.

646
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,980
The alpha good, alpha good or better
points.

647
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,900
Right?
So, and

648
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,670
if you have a convex function the sublevel
sets are convex, 'kay?

649
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,072
So, the set of points better than
something if you're trying to minimize it,

650
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,930
that's convex, 'kay.

651
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,470
The converse is false.

652
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,538
You can have convex sublevel sets and
you're not a convex function,

653
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:10,845
in fact those functions have a name, and
we'll get to them.

654
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:11,370
later.

655
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,638
The real, the, the closest connection,

656
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,238
the correct connection is through
something called the epigraph.

657
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:17,800
So epi means sort of above.

658
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,245
And, graph means of course, you know,
something that's, that's drawn or in

659
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:26,460
mathematics it's the pairs, points comma
values in our N plus 1 in graph space.

660
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,190
People can Rn plus 1.

661
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,254
And so the epigraph of a function is the
set of all pairs x t where f of x

662
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,312
is less than or equal to t, right?

663
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,947
So the normal graph is equals to t because
you just get the surface of the function.

664
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:34,843
So the normal graph is equals to t because
you just get the surface of the function.

665
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:40,420
So the normal graph is equals to t because
you just get the surface of the function.

666
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,084
The epigraph is everything above it right
so

667
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:46,868
its this shaded thing here its the
epigraph.

668
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:51,210
OK, and there's the connection very
simple.

669
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,040
So a function f is convex if and only if.

670
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,560
Its epigraph is a convex set and that's,
that's the connection.

671
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,672
So the real connection between convex
functions and

672
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,200
convex sets is through the epigraph,
right?

673
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,810
And in fact we'll see all sorts of cool
things.

674
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,220
You know various things about convex
sets,.

675
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,650
Those will all translate to various rules
about convex functions.

676
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,850
And we'll, we'll look at, you know?

677
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,180
We'll look at a couple of those, and all
that kind of stuff.

678
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,674
And so, in fact, what it will really mean
is that moving, after a while,

679
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:21,916
when you start, when you start
internalizing all these.

680
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,609
You'll have different ways to say the same
thing.

681
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,150
One will be a w statement about sets.

682
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,580
There'll be a statement about functions.

683
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,538
And the connection will be through the
epigraph.

684
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:32,502
Okay.

685
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:35,680
So, Jensen's inequality.

686
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,900
It's about a hundred years old.

687
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,762
Now maybe, actually a little bit more.

688
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:42,140
Actually the inequality was around
earlier.

689
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,380
You know, obviously, for, for, for very
specific things.

690
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,960
And it was was Jensen who kind of looked
at it and said Hey you know what.

691
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,405
Everyone keeps making the same, keeps
talking about the same inequality, and

692
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:54,650
here's here's what it is that they're all
saying.

693
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,250
He just collected the name for it.

694
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:56,910
OK.

695
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,260
Basic inequality says this.

696
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,560
If f is convex and you have theta between
zero and one, you have that.

697
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,620
Now and in fact that's the definition of
convexity.

698
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,880
So I don't know, anyway that.

699
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,182
That's called Jensen's Inequality.

700
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:14,540
OK, now it turns out Jensen's inequality
you can generalize various ways.

701
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,500
Number one to finite sms right so if I
have a if I have a set of points x

702
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,892
one through x k theta one through theta k
theta i non negative add up to one f

703
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:30,335
of sum theta i xi is less than equal to
sum theta ix of f of xi.

704
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:31,220
Okay?

705
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,270
So that's, that's it.

706
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,139
Then you can, you can extend it to
infinite sums, integrals, and

707
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:41,078
finally you go all the way and it's just
expectations.

708
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:43,180
So the right way to say it is this.

709
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,586
If you have a random variable Z, it takes
values from the domain of F.

710
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,257
Right.

711
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:50,339
By the way, if it doesn't take values, if
it, if there's a positive probability it

712
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:54,710
takes values outside the domain of f, then
there's really not much to say here.

713
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,020
But, so it takes, it's values are in the
domain of f,

714
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,105
almost surely, then the following is true.

715
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,900
F of the expected value is less than the
expected value of f of x.

716
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,220
That, that's it.

717
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,940
And guess what.

718
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,760
This very basic inequality here, is
exactly this.

719
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,830
This is the most general form of the
inequality.

720
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,600
And this is a special case of that for a
very specific distribution of z.

721
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,660
I mean, it's really dumb, it's atomic.

722
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,144
It's a distribution that assign, has the
value of x with a probability theta, and

723
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:27,760
probability y with probability of.

724
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,735
Has the value y with a probability of one
minus.

725
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,010
Data.

726
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,760
Then this is a special case of that.

727
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,590
So, so this is, so this is another way to
talk about convexity.

728
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,280
It's, function is convex if it doesn't
commute with expectation that's affine,

729
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,769
right, but what it does is expectation
Always, I means there's lots of ways to

730
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:51,923
say this but, well when you commute them
you get an inequality, right so

731
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,804
actually one way to say this is, and this
is weird and

732
00:34:54,804 --> 00:35:03,958
this is a little bit dialect but,
dithering increases the value of function.

733
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,850
Ok, that, that.

734
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:11,310
The dithering is to add noise to some zero
[INAUDIBLE] noise intentionally.

735
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:18,025
Ok, so now let's talk about some of these
operations that preserve convexity.

736
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:19,280
so.

737
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,568
What you'll have, what you, what you will
be doing establishing convexity of

738
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:27,135
functions, and sets, for that matter.

739
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:27,640
and, so.

740
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,550
How do you do this?

741
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,660
Well, one is just, every n-, every now and
then, although quite rarely.

742
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,800
The best thing to do is just roll up your
sleeves.

743
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,367
Fill at x y,

744
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:41,600
take a theta between 0 and 1 and just jump
in and then establish an inequality.

745
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,900
That's actually extremely rarely.

746
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,810
It's that the right thing to do, right?

747
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,320
Sometimes.

748
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,010
Or you can restrict to a line and verify
it.

749
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,060
That's another option.

750
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,360
Now, for twice differentiable functions,
you can differentiate twice.

751
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,290
And, if the function is simple enough, you
know, go ahead.

752
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,639
If it's not simple and,

753
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:07,630
in fact, it takes very little before this
method is completely unworkable.

754
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,140
Just because the notation proliferates and
you get horrible expressions and

755
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,950
you write it down and it's half a page of
Stuff, and someone says what's that?

756
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,640
And you go partial squared F, partial XI,
partial XJ.

757
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,440
And then, and then they say what do you
have to do now?

758
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,590
And you go, prove that that,

759
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,430
half page of formula represents a positive
semi affine matrix, right?

760
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,290
And this is not fun, so,.

761
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,880
Now, the way.

762
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
The, sort of, I think a more modern way to
do this.

763
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,760
Is certainly a, a way that is more useful.

764
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,200
And it's the way you will do it in this
course, mostly, is the following.

765
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,055
Is, you'll actually do this,
constructively by a calculus.

766
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:46,871
And what that means is, you'll, you'll
know a bunch of convex and

767
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,120
concave functions.

768
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,250
You've already seen a bunch.

769
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,620
You know, norms, and, you know?

770
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,500
Square root log entropy.

771
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,285
Geometric mean all sorts of things like
this, right?

772
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,505
You'll have those, you'll have, in that,

773
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:05,390
that by the way that list of atoms will
grow, as you learn more of them.

774
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,230
And then you'll have some operations that
preserve convexity.

775
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,130
Right so some of them are going to be some
are going to be totally obvious and

776
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,680
stupid like the sum of two convex
functions is convex.

777
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,500
Well duh two times a convex function is
convex fine right.

778
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,395
Minus three times a convex function is
concave OK fine.

779
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:25,121
Others are going to be way less obvious OK
so we'll, we'll get to those and

780
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:28,223
it turns out that you don't have to know a
whole lot of these things before you put

781
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:34,100
them all togeterh and they're actually
quite powerful at establishing convesity.

782
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,620
Parking capital or something like that.

783
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,130
And that, that, that's going to be the
thing.

784
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,146
Or if you like thinking of it from a
computer science point of view,

785
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:44,600
your proofs or verifications of convexity
are going to look like this.

786
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,860
Your going to have expressions and trees.

787
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,960
The leaves are going to be things you know
are convex or concave.

788
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,250
That's going to happen.

789
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,605
And, all of the internal nodes in that
expression tree are going to be

790
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:58,252
expressions whose convexity or

791
00:37:58,252 --> 00:38:02,600
concavity you can tag by one of these
calculus rules.

792
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,530
So if you understood that, great.

793
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,800
If you didn't, you will, because, you'll,
we're going to force you to.

794
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,370
Alright.
So let's start with the obvious ones.

795
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,130
I mean, positive weighted sum and
composition with an affine function.

796
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,420
So,.

797
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,790
Non negative multiple, these are kind of
obvious.

798
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,810
By the way these things do have to be
shown, right.

799
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,200
So somebody should show them, or you
should show them, or something.

800
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,079
I'm certainly not going to do it here.

801
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:25,850
sum.
Right.

802
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,760
So if you add 2 convex functions it's
convex.

803
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,114
I mean, it's kind of obvious.

804
00:38:30,114 --> 00:38:32,290
Composition with an affine function.

805
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,930
If you pre-compose.

806
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,300
A convex function with an affine function,
the result is convex.

807
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,270
Right?
Same for concave.

808
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,730
Let's look at some.

809
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,020
Here's one.
Log barrier for linear inequalities.

810
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,340
So, here's a function.

811
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,050
It's the sum of minus log, b i minus a i
transpose x.

812
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,680
The domain is this open polyhedron.

813
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,100
It's the set of points where it's the
interior of this, right?

814
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,950
So it, it doesn't include the boundary, is
what the domain of f is.

815
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,680
And in there, we can even, we can even
interpret these terms.

816
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,930
This, that's the margin in the ithenic
volume.

817
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,185
If you require BI to be bigger than AI
transpose X,

818
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:12,820
strictly bigger, that's the margin, a
positive number.

819
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,242
You take the log of that.

820
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,582
Well, okay that's, that's, if the margin
is small,

821
00:39:16,582 --> 00:39:19,003
that's a very large negative number.

822
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:21,330
And the minus sign converts it that way.

823
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,450
This is a, so true that this is a convex
function,

824
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,200
called a logarithmic barrier function for
this polyhedron.

825
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,435
And we're going to see a lot of that later
in the class.

826
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:32,315
And you can guess kind of why it's called
a logarithmic barrier because if

827
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,880
you were to visualize that function on a
polyhedron, this function,

828
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,510
it goes to plus infinity on the
boundaries, right?

829
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,490
As you move towards the boundary, one of
your margin,

830
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,080
at least one of your margin gets really
small.

831
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,320
One term in here.

832
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,023
One term in here goes to zero; the log
goes to minus infinity, and

833
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:51,160
the minus makes it go to plus infinity.

834
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,050
So it's like a barrier.

835
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,338
If you think of it like in physics,

836
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:56,272
a potential function, it's an infinite
potential well.

837
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,802
Okay?
That's what this is.

838
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:02,002
Alright, you can have the norm of an
affine function, right,

839
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:07,260
because that's an affine function composed
with a norm which is convex.

840
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean, this is kind of obvious, but,
we'll quickly get to ones that are not.

841
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,915
So, pointwise maximum.

842
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:15,085
So if you have a bunch of convex
functions,

843
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,110
then their pointwise maximum is convex.

844
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,250
I mean, this is kind of obvious.

845
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,320
I'm just going to draw a picture.

846
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,440
Here's one function.

847
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,500
Here's another.

848
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,880
Here's the pointwise maximum, is this
function here.

849
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,850
That's the pointwise maximum, and it's
convex.

850
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,730
I mean, the picture is clear.

851
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,525
It's two lines of a proof, if you can
stretch it to two lines.

852
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:38,020
You know.
It's, it's not hard to show.

853
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,383
Actually this is very interesting and this
tells you that you are you

854
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:44,451
are not in the calculus mode anymore
here's why this is one of

855
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:51,620
the most most basic constructors of convex
functions is through point wise maximum.

856
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,116
And what's completely clear even this
little example I

857
00:40:55,116 --> 00:40:59,880
just drew is it does not preserve
differentiability.

858
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,378
Right max of even differentiable functions
is generally not diffrentiable OK

859
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:07,760
you get points and in fact that's kind of
a theme for the whole course.

860
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,480
It turns out differentiability doesn't
play a huge role in convexity.

861
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,248
There is certainly complex optimization,
it doesn't play a big role.

862
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:19,090
So and again, these are just things that
we're, you're going to just,

863
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,972
this'll be clear, but

864
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:24,720
this is kind of your first hint that this
is not going to be like a calculus class.

865
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,186
So, here are some quick examples.

866
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:31,840
Piecewise-linear function so that maximum,
I have a bunch of affine functions.

867
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,341
Then piecewise-linear functions just, the
max,

868
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:38,380
a maximum of them, that's convex
immediately, right.

869
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,592
So, by the way that's a very specific form
of of a piecewise-linear function, right,

870
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:45,450
because normally when people talk about
piecewise-linear functions.

871
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,930
They talk, you know, you, you specify the
dom, the, the little regions, and

872
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,510
then on that region, you say it has this
value and this value and so on.

873
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,950
This one kind of does all that implicitly.

874
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,290
It just says it's the maximum of a bunch
of functions, right?

875
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,810
Here's an affine function, here's that,
you know?

876
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,770
That is the maximum.

877
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,613
The function, it looks like this.

878
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,350
That is the, that's a piecewise-linear
convex function, right.

879
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,010
And it's just the maximum of a bunch of
affine functions.

880
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,545
Here's one that's less obvious.

881
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:15,240
How about this?

882
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,680
The sum of the r largest components of a
vector, 'kay?

883
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,680
So the sum of the five largest components.

884
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,250
That's kind of a complicated thing, right?

885
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,090
If anything, you should be getting a
combinatorial feel for it.

886
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,602
This is convex, and the argument is really
quick.

887
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:37,710
Let's talk about different ways you might
show this.

888
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,840
Okay, let's talk about differentiating.

889
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,370
If you, let's talk about it.

890
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,072
So what's the derivative?

891
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:49,154
What the gradient of the function which is
the sum of the five largest entries in

892
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:51,148
a vector?

893
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:56,870
Wherever the five largest elements are
bigger than.

894
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,090
There's a gap between the fifth and sixth
element in the vector.

895
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,650
That function is actually just alfine.

896
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,630
And what is the gradient there?

897
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,347
It's a vector with a 1 in each component
if you're among the top five, and

898
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:08,120
0 otherwise.

899
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,820
Right?

900
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,570
So that's fine.

901
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,710
It's got a gradient.

902
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,734
And you could try to show that gradient
inequality or

903
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:17,470
something like that, ignoring the fact
that, in fact, the gradient doesn't exist.

904
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,570
When there's a tie between the fifth and
sixth elements in this function.

905
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,247
And a hessian out of the, it's just zero
everywhere,

906
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,540
except on these points where it doesn't
exist, and all that kind of stuff.

907
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,120
So it gets weird.

908
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,759
Okay.
So that doesn't work.

909
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,790
But it's actually very easy to say what it
is.

910
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:37,280
It's a maximum over, n choose r linear
functions.

911
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,120
Because what I do is this.

912
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,860
I simply say.

913
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:47,560
I take all vectors, which consist of r1s
and n minus r0s.

914
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,870
And then, of which there's n choose r.

915
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,758
Right, so I take all those vectors, and

916
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:55,340
I take the linear function, which is that
vector in a product with x.

917
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,840
That's the sum of a particular, actually
each one of those.

918
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,750
In our products is the sum of five
particular elements.

919
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,490
I'm going to take r equals five.

920
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,815
So, it's the sum of five particular
elements in that vector.

921
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:08,830
Right?

922
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,740
And now I take the maximum of all of
those.

923
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,054
Right?
That will give me the sum of

924
00:44:13,054 --> 00:44:14,200
the five largest.

925
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,160
Okay?

926
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,414
So there's a two line proof,

927
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:25,890
one line that the sum of the three largest
entries in a vector is, Is convex.

928
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,520
OK?

929
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,750
So that's it.

930
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,257
By the way, this doesn't give you a good
way to calculate it this way.

931
00:44:31,257 --> 00:44:32,395
But still.

932
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:35,232
OK.
Well this idea extends actually to

933
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:41,940
infinite sums, and it's the same way if
you go back to the epigraphs.

934
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,440
It's the same way, it says that
intersection of an arbitrary number.

935
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,610
A convex sets as convex.

936
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,598
So, here, pointwise supremum,

937
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:53,500
is you can have the supremum over an
arbitrary set of functions.

938
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,820
Right, ar, arbitrary set of convex
functions.

939
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,198
So the idea is this, if you have a
function, F of X and Y.

940
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,980
Y actually can be completely abstract.

941
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,770
It does not have to be a vector in our n,
right?

942
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,260
It can be indexed by sup things or strings
or weird, I don't know, anything, right?

943
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,421
It doesn't ma, matter.

944
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:16,469
It says that if this function is convex in
x for each y,

945
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:23,290
then the supremum of this Of these
functions is convex in x.

946
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,000
And we can look at some simple examples.

947
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,650
Here's one.

948
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,341
The support function of a set is this.

949
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:34,590
Here's a set here, here's a set.

950
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,940
It doesn't have to be convex right?

951
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,770
Like that, that's C.

952
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,010
And the support function says, here's a
vector y.

953
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,332
You actually form the largest inner
product, and so

954
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:49,360
that would tell you Well, I didn't draw it
right, but it looks something like that.

955
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,230
Here, I'll, I'll bend my set to touch it
there.

956
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,790
Okay?

957
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,940
So this would give you, it tells you how
far you can go in the direction y.

958
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,120
And it's as a function of y.

959
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,800
That is a convex function of x.

960
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,860
'Kay?
And so let's see, why is that?

961
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,097
Why would you say that?

962
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:10,824
Well What kind of function of x is y
transpose x?

963
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,940
It's linear, okay?

964
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,510
So it's linear.

965
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,822
Therefore, it's convex.

966
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:18,050
Because, convex promotes to linear, right?

967
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,170
I'm sorry.
Linear promotes to convex, okay?

968
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,959
So, the, and then it's a supreme over
them, so that's convex.

969
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,989
Here's another one for fun.

970
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:30,070
Is the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric
matrix right?

971
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:36,650
That's one way to write that is this, it's
the supremum of Y transposed capital X y.

972
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,650
Subject to norm Y equals 1.

973
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,500
Okay?
That, that,

974
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,490
the answer is the maxim eigenvalue of X.

975
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,840
Right?
That's almost the definition, okay?

976
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,815
So, then the question is.

977
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:50,340
How do you, how we do know that's a convex
function?

978
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,340
By the way, we already talked about it.

979
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,410
It's a quite con-, complicated function,
right?

980
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,330
It involves writing out the, you know?

981
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,190
The characteristic value of x.

982
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,300
Factoring it, taking the largest, you
know?

983
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,330
All this kind of stuff.

984
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,067
So let's see.
What kind of function of capital x is y

985
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,768
transpose x.

986
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:08,460
Why?
It's linear and that's right.

987
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,820
Actually this is a very good, this is the
first time you've seen this.

988
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,316
There are going to be lots of times when
someone walks up to you and

989
00:47:13,316 --> 00:47:15,210
you see Y transposed X Y.

990
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:22,440
The quadratic part of your brain is
already, sort of actit-, activated.

991
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:22,970
Right?

992
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:23,870
It's Y transposed X Y.

993
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,512
It's quadratic.

994
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:28,398
Right so but here you have to be you have
to think very straight because

995
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:34,456
someonee says y is given x is the variable
and that thing is linear right.

996
00:47:34,456 --> 00:47:37,400
So this is kind of the idea and then we
take a supremum of this over all possible

997
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,055
y and you get something that's convex.

998
00:47:40,055 --> 00:47:47,015
Its the composition of functions so here's
the idea I have a function,.

999
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:48,488
H.

1000
00:47:48,488 --> 00:47:50,550
And I have a function g and I compose
them.

1001
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,550
So I take h of g of x.

1002
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,020
I'm going to call that f.

1003
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,700
And the basic rule is very simple.

1004
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,770
It turns out that a convex increasing
function of a convex function is convex.

1005
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,950
Okay, so that's, that's the, that's,
that's the basic composition rule.

1006
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,540
Convex increasing.

1007
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,300
Now there's some details here and they're,
they are actually important.

1008
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,780
They are not little sort of analytical.

1009
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,740
Things that only a mathematician would
worry about.

1010
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,070
They are quite real, and they have all
sorts of consequences.

1011
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,802
The first is this.

1012
00:48:19,802 --> 00:48:22,420
the, the outer function, here.

1013
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,440
The one that you apply.

1014
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,330
The increasing or non decreasing re-,
restriction there is actually on its,.

1015
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,150
It, its conve-.

1016
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,872
It's, it's.

1017
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:35,330
Extended value extension.

1018
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:43,520
Right, so, so here h tilde is the extended
valued extension of h.

1019
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,460
OK and so, what this says, I mean we can
look at some examples.

1020
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,055
So here's a function, let's take.

1021
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:58,530
H of x equals x squared with dom h equals
r plus.

1022
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,837
Okay?
Now, in fact, you would normally say,

1023
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,340
that function is non-decreasing, it's
increasing.

1024
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,430
Okay?

1025
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,530
It, it is increasing.

1026
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,739
If you take any two points on its domain,
which is non,

1027
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:11,960
non-negative numbers One is bigger than
the other then.

1028
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,030
It's, it's bigger because the square makes
things bigger.

1029
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:14,550
Okay?

1030
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,120
Period.

1031
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,990
So that's an increasing function.

1032
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,240
That's not good here.

1033
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,672
That won't work here because h tilde looks
like this,

1034
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:26,610
h tilde, I'm just going to draw it kind of
Is a diagram.

1035
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,590
It kind of goes up here to plus infinity.

1036
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:34,270
Okay, and so the point is, that is not,
that is not an increasing function.

1037
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,640
Well, in fact you can see it goes from
plus infinity down to zero.

1038
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,480
And in fact,

1039
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,260
if I compose This function here with
something like x minus 1 squared.

1040
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,750
The, actually, the conclusion is wrong.

1041
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,450
You get a function that is not convex.

1042
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,200
Okay?

1043
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,370
So, these are detail-, these are details.

1044
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,720
But they're actually important ones.

1045
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,080
I don't expect you to get it here.

1046
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,730
You should, you know?

1047
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,570
You should be read-, you'll read this part
of the chapter.

1048
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,300
And you'll do homework exercises and
things like that.

1049
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,170
Then it'll become clear.

1050
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,123
But the, the zeroth level one that you
should remember is

1051
00:50:04,123 --> 00:50:08,280
convex increasing function of a convex
function is convex.

1052
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,700
OK, so and then there's variations on
that.

1053
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:18,335
A, you have a function is convex if the
inner function is concave but h is.

1054
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:21,130
Instead if non decreasing, non increasing.

1055
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,780
So it's basically a decreasing function
okay, informally.

1056
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,030
So that's the idea.

1057
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,730
Now how do you prove this?

1058
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,479
You can actually prove this directly and
it's actually quite simple.

1059
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:31,804
And in fact it's even clearer,

1060
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:35,558
because a basic proof of this there's one
in the book.

1061
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,730
Basically does not requi-, it doesn't.

1062
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,530
It makes no assumptions whatsoever about h
and g.

1063
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,850
They don't have to be differentiable.

1064
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,280
Nothing, right?

1065
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,776
But an instructive proof is actually to do
one,

1066
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,860
assuming that these are scalar fun-, that
x is scalar.

1067
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,880
And that these function are differentiable
twice, right?

1068
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,960
So, in that case, you just take the train
rule.

1069
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,246
And you work out what the second
derivative of F is.

1070
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:59,956
Right?
Because essentially,

1071
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:03,590
convexity is a statement about the second
derivative.

1072
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,320
Right?
I mean, when a function is convex or, or

1073
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,010
sorry, when a function is smooth.

1074
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,501
So here, you simply work out what the
second derivative here and

1075
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,430
you get this expression here.

1076
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,130
And so This,

1077
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:18,870
this composition theorem here is actually
going to turn out to be very simple.

1078
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:23,520
It's a case where trivially you can assert
the sign of the second derivative.

1079
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,180
OK?
So let's look at it.

1080
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,990
If you look at the first term, you see
that there's a h prime prime.

1081
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,266
So let's look at this theorem that says
that a convex increasing function of

1082
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:34,532
a convex function is convex.

1083
00:51:34,532 --> 00:51:37,637
Well here, h prime prime, this thing, is
bigger than or

1084
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:42,250
equal to zero.That's what it means to be
convex.

1085
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,855
This is squared, and so it's totally
relevant, it's not negative.

1086
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,410
Right?

1087
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,400
Then this thing here, that's the
assumption.

1088
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,950
It's of a convex function.

1089
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,922
So this is, this is going to be non
negative.

1090
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:54,900
And then this here.

1091
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,430
Now you can see where the monotonicity
requirement comes in.

1092
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,852
The monotonicity requirement comes in
because it gets multiplied by h

1093
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:02,280
prime, right?

1094
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,855
So, another way to say it is something
like this, and this'll be very rough.

1095
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:11,703
But, this composition theorem tells you
when you can deduce the sign of the second

1096
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:19,800
derivative, using, well, calculus and then
a very elementary signed arithmetic.

1097
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,420
Signed arithmetic is very simple, right?

1098
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,582
It means you multiply two things that are
non-negative,

1099
00:52:23,582 --> 00:52:25,451
you get something non-negative.

1100
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:26,640
You add non-negative things, they're
non-negative.

1101
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,861
You add a ne, you multiply a negative and

1102
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:29,860
a positive thing, you get something
negative.

1103
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,390
That's like signed arithmetic, okay?

1104
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,540
So it says It says that basically from
calculus and

1105
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,650
signed arithmetic, you can conclude the
sign of the second derivative.

1106
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,570
If it's positive, you got a convex
function.

1107
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,730
If it's negative, you got a concave.

1108
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,850
Everyone following this?

1109
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,242
OK, so, but I, the interesting, the funny
part is actually the, the proof that

1110
00:52:49,242 --> 00:52:54,272
holds completely generally, right, not for
differentiable, is actually easier.

1111
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,930
Then it's, well, at least mathematically
it's easier.

1112
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,760
All right.

1113
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,110
So what are some examples?

1114
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:03,410
It says that the exponential of a convex
function is convex, okay?

1115
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,379
And the inverse of a,

1116
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:08,720
of a function is convex if the function is
concave and positive, right?

1117
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,290
So one over a concave function is going to
be.

1118
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,130
Concave, sorry, convex.

1119
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:15,650
Right?

1120
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:21,231
So, okay, alright, now there's a vector
version of this, right?

1121
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,385
When a function takes multiple arguments
and

1122
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:28,500
actually This is incredibly important,.

1123
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,850
We can argue that the one thing on this
page you're going to use,

1124
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:35,960
probably every day for the rest of the
quarter.

1125
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,970
Not, maybe not today, tomorrow.

1126
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,130
But starting, like next week, I promise
you.

1127
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,355
You will use this every single day.

1128
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:45,081
So, we're going to arrange the homework
load to ensure that you'll be

1129
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:46,660
using this everyday.

1130
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,450
So this is it.

1131
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,245
Here it is.

1132
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:51,551
It's this, it says, so all I'm saying is,
this, this is, this is going to be

1133
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:56,880
a big part of your life is going to be,
actually just this one composition term.

1134
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,800
It's this, it says suppose you have a
function.

1135
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,740
So G of X, has, is is R k value, right.

1136
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,868
So, I have a function h, of k, k
arguments.

1137
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:10,000
G1 through gk.

1138
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,530
And I want to con, conclude convexity of
that thing.

1139
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:17,822
Well, a simple one is, is this, is if the
enclosing function h is convex.

1140
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,100
And then there's a rule.

1141
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,140
And it say's that for each argument, that,
I mean these are the two simple versions.

1142
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,305
But then I'll give you a completely
general version.

1143
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,590
The simple version is this.

1144
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:32,480
Is that if each of these arguments is
convex right?

1145
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,618
And H is increasing in each argument.

1146
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:36,498
Okay.

1147
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:38,989
And in fact it's h tilde, the extended bag
extension, but

1148
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:41,270
let's, that's, that's the idea.

1149
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,930
So, in fact, it's the natural extension,
right?

1150
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,518
So what it says is, is this right, each of
these right here, h is,

1151
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:53,290
is you, you analyze the monotonicity with
respect to each argument.

1152
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,050
And if it's increasing in every argument,
then you can take a convex.

1153
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:57,970
Function at each point.

1154
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,725
Actually, you can mix and match these.

1155
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,650
So, let me explain that, and in fact, let
me give you a very general one.

1156
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,144
It goes something like this.

1157
00:55:05,144 --> 00:55:08,312
F is convex if, and this is only
sufficient,

1158
00:55:08,312 --> 00:55:14,810
it is absolutely not necessary, it's, if
the following is true.

1159
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,140
For each i, right?

1160
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,912
And I'll, I'll give you a more general
version, and we'll have an exercise on

1161
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:23,340
this, so don't worry about it, but I just
thought I'd say it now.

1162
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,069
One of the following occurs.

1163
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:29,185
first, if, if, gi is affine, then you,
there are no,

1164
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:37,510
absolutely no monotonicity requirements
on, on the enclosing function h.

1165
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,570
Right?
That's the first one, right?

1166
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,329
Or gi is convex and h h,

1167
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:49,183
sorry, is increasing in Arg i.

1168
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:49,824
Okay?

1169
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:57,515
I'm, I'm writing this informally, but you
know what I mean.

1170
00:55:57,515 --> 00:56:02,936
Or gi is concave and h is decreasing in
arg i.

1171
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:04,930
Okay?

1172
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:05,520
So that's it.

1173
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,600
So, now one of the reasons that you need
to know this is because this is

1174
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,170
the basis of for example, cvx.

1175
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,690
Which you'll be using starting next week.

1176
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,130
Okay, which is a software system for

1177
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,470
doing convex optimization, convex
analysis, things like that.

1178
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:25,400
And it's all based on these basic rules of
convex analysis, right.

1179
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,211
Although, they're basic but you get a lot
of them.

1180
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:31,743
So this is, this is the, the idea.

1181
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,066
There details here like the monotonicity
has to be with respect to

1182
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:41,110
the extended value extensions, so you have
to take the domain into account.

1183
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,382
So, there's a generalization of the
others.

1184
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:46,946
actually, here's a very interesting fact
all the other rules you've seen so

1185
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:50,690
far, almost all of them This includes
them, right.

1186
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,570
When you teach this stuff to humans, you
say things like look it's good to

1187
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,020
know that the sum of convex functions is
convex, right.

1188
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,975
That follows actually from this directly.

1189
00:56:58,975 --> 00:57:03,170
because all I do is I take h, the outer
function to be the sum.

1190
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,710
It's kind of a silly, right, it takes two
arguments and it adds them, right.

1191
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,430
So that's a convex function.

1192
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,965
I mean.

1193
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:10,800
Sure, right.

1194
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,030
It's convex, oh and guess what, it's
monotone increasing in each argument.

1195
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,120
Therefore, the sum of two convex functions
is convex.

1196
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,969
Now that's kind of pedantic, right,
because it's a,

1197
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:25,250
you're using a sledgehammer to show
something that's quite obvious.

1198
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,310
Everyone following this?

1199
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,510
But my point is.

1200
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,132
Then in fact this is kind of the only
thing you need to know actually is

1201
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:31,820
just this one thing.

1202
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,902
There's max we looked at that we said that
we observed at the max of a pointwise max

1203
00:57:34,902 --> 00:57:38,090
of a bunch of convex functions is convex.

1204
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:42,420
Well guess what all you do is you take
this theorm you take h is the max.

1205
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,510
That's a convex function by itself it is
increasing in each argument.

1206
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,090
I guess not in its, its non-decreasing.

1207
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,344
Oh.
You have to distinguish between

1208
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:53,510
informal speech and then when you're
writing.

1209
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,109
So when I'm talking, it's informal speech,
and

1210
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:57,249
I say "increasing" to mean non-decreasing.

1211
00:57:57,249 --> 00:57:58,505
Okay.
So, so it -- so -- so

1212
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:02,537
this also tells me that the maximum of a
bunch of convex functions is maximum,

1213
00:58:02,537 --> 00:58:05,150
point-wise maximum.

1214
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,802
So you, you actually get a lot out of this
one A, one composition here.

1215
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:11,977
So let's look at an example.

1216
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:15,065
You have something like this.

1217
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:15,780
well, let's see.

1218
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:22,690
The sum of the log of bunch of concave
functions, is going to be concave.

1219
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,726
Right?
And that would follow from

1220
00:58:23,726 --> 00:58:24,580
something like this.

1221
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,400
Here's one.

1222
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,230
Log sum X of GI.

1223
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:29,800
Of x.

1224
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,150
If the GIs are convex.

1225
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,710
Log sum x g, i.

1226
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,740
That's convex.

1227
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,120
By the way, you should be getting a little
bit of,.

1228
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,060
L, let's first, let's talk about that a
little bit.

1229
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,620
And I'll just say a little bit about it.

1230
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,170
Log sum exp you should think of as a soft
max.

1231
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,170
It's an analytic or smooth approximation
of the max function.

1232
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:50,010
But the max of a bunch of convex functions
is met, is convex.

1233
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:50,640
So, you know?

1234
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,830
Intuition suggests that log sum exp would
be convex.

1235
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,800
So.

1236
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,400
Immediately, we get a, this is consistent
just by intuition, right.

1237
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,713
And then, now there's all sorts of things
we could do here to parse this and

1238
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:05,740
establish convexity.

1239
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,600
I'll show you one that doesn't work first.

1240
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,790
The first one is to, is to simply parse it
from the inside and go out.

1241
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,509
Here's one.

1242
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:16,758
What can you say if GI is convex what can
you say about X GI.

1243
00:59:16,758 --> 00:59:18,398
It's convex.

1244
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:20,350
because that's the most basic thing there
is, right.

1245
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,030
It's convex increasing function of
[UNKNOWN].

1246
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,850
Okay, how about the sum?

1247
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,652
You can label that.

1248
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:27,150
It's convex.

1249
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,410
Okay.
How about the log of a convex function.

1250
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,020
Right.

1251
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,190
There, in fact, it's false.

1252
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,750
There's no rule, that's, you can have the
log of a convex function, it's nothing.

1253
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,655
It could be.

1254
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:40,750
That, you could, that could be concave, it
could be convex, it can be anything.

1255
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:45,175
There is no rule that says the log of a
convex function is anything.

1256
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:46,790
because there, it just, just isn't one.

1257
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,485
Everybody see that?

1258
00:59:47,485 --> 00:59:49,110
So that failed completely.

1259
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,410
What is the correct parsing of this?

1260
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:59,860
What you do is you make h the log sum x
function.

1261
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:04,400
The log sum x function is clearly, it's
what's convex.

1262
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,470
And it is increasing in each argument.

1263
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,480
By the way, there, it really is
increasing, so I'm okay.

1264
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,235
That's informal and formal.

1265
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:15,530
It's [INAUDIBLE], and therefore, log sum x
of a bunch of convex functions is convex.

1266
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,480
Everybody.

1267
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,472
Got that?
So, actually,

1268
01:00:17,472 --> 01:00:21,460
a lot of this will become much clearer as
you get into actually doing these things.

1269
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,540
But, what this says is, proving convexity
of something it's not as,

1270
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,530
you just don't write the first parse tree
that comes down.

1271
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:29,900
Because it might be wrong.

1272
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,780
The first parsing might, well sorry, not
that it's wrong,

1273
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,395
it won't work using these rules.

1274
01:00:35,395 --> 01:00:36,240
Okay?

1275
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,301
Okay.

1276
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:42,620
So minimu-, this is a very, minimization
is a very general construction.

1277
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,430
Oh and I should contrast this with
maximization.

1278
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,390
You remember the following.

1279
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:50,944
That if I had a function F of 2 variables
here if this was,

1280
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:53,716
if this function is convex in X for

1281
01:00:53,716 --> 01:01:02,345
each Y Then, the following, is, this is
just y in any set, right?

1282
01:01:02,345 --> 01:01:06,480
This function is convex in x, right?

1283
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,952
So, there's absolutely no requirement that
the function be convex in x and

1284
01:01:09,952 --> 01:01:13,900
y and, in fact, y here doesn't even have
to be a vector.

1285
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,560
It could be some any other kind of, it
could be some weird combinatorial thing.

1286
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,070
It could be over parse trees or, it
doesn't really matter.

1287
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,000
It could be Anything.

1288
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,530
Right?
So

1289
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,280
the sepremum of an arbitrary family of
convex functions is convex.

1290
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,698
What's interesting is, infemum, the
minimum,

1291
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:33,922
of a convex function, sometimes yields a
convex function, but

1292
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:38,720
it's in very specific cases, and the
conditions are stronger.

1293
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,770
It's this.

1294
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:43,340
If you have a function that is, it has to
be jointly convex and X M Y.

1295
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,180
So it's convex and both X M Y.

1296
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,546
And if you a convex set then the infimum
is

1297
01:01:48,546 --> 01:01:54,250
sometimes called the partial minimization
of F.

1298
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,400
Right?
Cause I have a function F of several,

1299
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,040
well 2 blocks of variables X M Y.

1300
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,880
And I'm going to minimize it over one
block.

1301
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,880
And that will leave a function of the
remaining variable.

1302
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,120
Has everybody got this?

1303
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,980
That's called partial minimization, is
another name for this operation.

1304
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,766
Partial minimization.

1305
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:16,120
And partial minimization, here preserves
convexing.

1306
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,740
So if you do partial minimization, you get
a convex one.

1307
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,571
This is actually extremely important.

1308
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,030
This is kind of the basis of a lot of
things like.

1309
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,840
Dynamic programming or something like
that.

1310
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,528
It says that you can minimize over some
things, and

1311
01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:31,920
look at this as a function of what's left.

1312
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,420
And then you can minimize over some more
things.

1313
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,590
And some more.
And some more.And some more.

1314
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,800
And that would give you dynamic
programming in the right circumstances.

1315
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,920
Right?
So that, that's the idea.

1316
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,890
This is actually, this is actually quite
important.

1317
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,280
OK.
So this is called partial minimization.

1318
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,645
And it, it comes up in a whole bunch of
things.

1319
01:02:47,645 --> 01:02:49,830
You'll see some of it later.

1320
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:50,650
Surely.

1321
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,260
Oh, by the way in terms of epigraphs this
is embarrass-, look here,

1322
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,150
it looks very complicated.

1323
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:58,495
Like, oh my god you're minimizing this
thing and you know it's complicated.

1324
01:02:58,495 --> 01:03:01,980
It turns out in terms of epigraphs, this
is nothing but projections.

1325
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,620
Projections of an epigraph onto, the
first, like you know, whatever it is,

1326
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,302
end components.

1327
01:03:07,302 --> 01:03:08,764
It's nothing more.

1328
01:03:08,764 --> 01:03:10,594
You can check that, right?

1329
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:12,590
Okay, so here's a, here's a very famous
example.

1330
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,150
Let's take a quadratic function.

1331
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,290
So that, that's it.

1332
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:19,060
But we're going to block the variable into
2, the argument to 2, 2 parts.

1333
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,890
X and Y, right?

1334
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,380
So, here's a general.

1335
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:27,105
That's, that's a general convex quadratic
function of 2 sets of variables,

1336
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:30,070
quadratic form x and y.

1337
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,990
And what it is, and it is jointly convex
in x and y,

1338
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:36,190
that means its block matrix is positive
semidefinite.

1339
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:38,940
For simplicity we'll assume c is positive
definite.

1340
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,330
You, you actually don't need to, but
that's okay.

1341
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:44,130
And now, if we minimize over y, you can do
that [UNKNOWN] you just set

1342
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,330
the gradient equal to zero and various
other things, and what you'll get is a,

1343
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:51,440
you, the result is actually a quadratic
form.

1344
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,350
Over x.

1345
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,974
And the matrix there is this thing, it's a
minus b c inverse b transpose.

1346
01:03:57,974 --> 01:04:01,234
You probabily have seen this matrix
before.

1347
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:06,226
If not, get used to it because you will
see it in pretty much any class you take,

1348
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:08,960
any good class.

1349
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,060
If you don't see it then I'm suspicious.

1350
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,060
Of, of the class.

1351
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,936
Right so, for example This is the matrix
that comes up, in example for

1352
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:20,960
circuits analysis, and mechanical,
mechanical engineering.

1353
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,570
Everything is this, right, analysis of
structures in, probability.

1354
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,500
This is conditioning.

1355
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,010
This is the covariant, this is the
conditional covariance.

1356
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,778
This is, what, this is how you condition.

1357
01:04:31,778 --> 01:04:32,781
Right?

1358
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:36,265
So and it's actually a nice thing to
remember in your head as

1359
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:37,940
a big high level thing is this,

1360
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:44,360
is quadratic functions actually are
preserved under partial minimization.

1361
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,300
That's actually extremely important,
right?

1362
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,785
It says that if you, if you take a,

1363
01:04:47,785 --> 01:04:51,410
a quadratic function, convex quadratic
function.

1364
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,200
And you minimize over some variables.

1365
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,470
Then the result is a quadratic form,

1366
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,350
convex quadratic form in the remaining
variables, and,

1367
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,050
in fact, specifically, it's the Schur
complement.

1368
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,668
This matrix is called the Schur
complement.

1369
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:04,039
So, okay.

1370
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:06,275
And we'll have a, we'll certainly have an
exercise on that, and

1371
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:08,984
you're going to encounter the Schur
complement, like, throughout the class,

1372
01:05:08,984 --> 01:05:13,468
and, for that matter, throughout And every
other class you take, I hope.

1373
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:17,836
Another not-obvious not-obvious operation
that

1374
01:05:17,836 --> 01:05:22,890
preserves convexity is perspective
mapping.

1375
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,770
So perspective mapping is this, and you'll
remember,

1376
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:31,980
you'll remember that perspective the
projective mapping for convex sets, right?

1377
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,576
That was something that took [UNKNOWN], it
took X and

1378
01:05:34,576 --> 01:05:37,730
divided by the last component or
something.

1379
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,480
And it basically, it's a, it's what it
looks like when you see

1380
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,260
a three-dimensional object when you put
that onto an image plane, right.

1381
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,400
So, this is the perspective of a function
is this.

1382
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,575
You have a function from Rn to R.

1383
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:55,206
The perspective is a function on the graph
space, so it actually takes two arguments.

1384
01:05:55,206 --> 01:05:58,877
One in Rn and one in R.

1385
01:05:58,877 --> 01:05:59,774
In fact r plus or

1386
01:05:59,774 --> 01:06:05,140
actually r plus, plus so positive argument
and its this tf of x over t.

1387
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:10,036
So that, that is the perspective of a, of
a function, and it is the set the domain

1388
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:17,455
is the set of points where t is positive
and x over t is in the domain of f.

1389
01:06:17,455 --> 01:06:19,825
And it turns out this is jointly convex in
x and t.

1390
01:06:19,825 --> 01:06:20,870
Okay?

1391
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,382
So that's, that's, and by the way,

1392
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:26,000
very simple if you want to know what this
is look like in terms of epic graphs, this

1393
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,940
is you have the projective transformation
on the epic graph, and so that's.

1394
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,650
That's what it does, gives you this.

1395
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,830
So let's look at some examples.

1396
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,011
Oh, here's one.

1397
01:06:37,011 --> 01:06:38,564
well, let's see.

1398
01:06:38,564 --> 01:06:40,840
F of x equals x transpose x.

1399
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,980
That's the sum of the squares.

1400
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:42,820
That's convex.

1401
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,830
In fact, in some ways, that's your
canonical smooth convex function, right?

1402
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:46,640
That graph is a bowl.

1403
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,593
That couldn't get simpler than that.

1404
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,410
So if you calculate the perspective of
that, its this.

1405
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,955
You'd take, well, basically, you'd take.

1406
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:59,630
T, and then x over t transpose, x over t.

1407
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:04,690
And when all the smoke clears you get the
sum of the squares divided by t.

1408
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,430
And that's convex.

1409
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,380
Right?
So now you remember we showed x

1410
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,490
squared over y.

1411
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,342
Was convex when y is positive before, and
its got various names like you

1412
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:17,790
know quadratic over linear I don't know
there's lots of names for that function.

1413
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,694
But we did it by calculating a hessian and

1414
01:07:19,694 --> 01:07:23,335
that's fine it doesn't kill you to
calculate a hessian.

1415
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:28,173
But here it says that this file was
instantly from the perspective,

1416
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:31,740
mapping right,.

1417
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,890
Here's one.

1418
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,480
The negative logarithm in convex.

1419
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,910
So if I calculate what its perspective is.

1420
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:42,560
It's simply t log x over t.

1421
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,830
And that is this thing.

1422
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,810
And it says that's the relative
[INAUDIBLE].

1423
01:07:46,864 --> 01:07:50,786
And it says that that is going to be
convex, on.

1424
01:07:50,786 --> 01:07:54,700
On our, on-on, jointy in t and x, right?

1425
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,581
So a lot of things will come out, it takes
an innocent function where convexity is

1426
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:00,032
obvious or concavity like log, and you
apply something like this and

1427
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:04,020
all of a sudden things like [UNKNOWN]
diverergence comes out.

1428
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,990
Functions that look like it would be kind
of a pain in the ass to prove are convex,

1429
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,778
and they just pop right out from this
rule.

1430
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:11,310
Okay?

1431
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:16,430
So they also often have interesting
meanings in that field.

1432
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,777
So if you're in a field and you work out
the perspective of a function, right,

1433
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:25,508
it often has some interesting meaning in
that field.

1434
01:08:25,508 --> 01:08:26,068
So, okay.

1435
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,717
The conjugate.

1436
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:32,777
So this is also something that's going to
come up like crazy in chapter 5 and

1437
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:35,480
this may have come up in other classes
you've seen especially if

1438
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,122
you took economics except it wasn't stated
this clearly.

1439
01:08:40,122 --> 01:08:42,740
Unless you took a graduate course.

1440
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,753
If you took an undergraduate course you
saw this but they went on and on and

1441
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,270
it wasn't clear, but anyway.

1442
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,125
So the conjugate of a function is this,
and

1443
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:51,460
again, all of this is sort of without
context, so.

1444
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,021
Starting next week.

1445
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:55,042
Beginning of next week you'll start seeing
you'll,

1446
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:58,420
you'll actually start seeing applications
and stuff like that.

1447
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,300
But for now all of this is without
context.

1448
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,980
So here's the conjugate.

1449
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:05,730
The conjugate, of a function is this: it's
denoted f star here.

1450
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,857
And I mean that's kind of standard right,
because there's a whole bunch of

1451
01:09:09,857 --> 01:09:13,940
mathematical terms that you use and they
kind of evoke the same thing.

1452
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,489
Dual Conjugate.

1453
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:20,228
Can you think of many others?

1454
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:21,920
Ii kind of think.

1455
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,170
What they all suggest.

1456
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,540
Things that if you do them.

1457
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,546
twice you get back to where you started or

1458
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:30,840
something like that, if certain things
happen.

1459
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,350
it's one of them.

1460
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:36,470
Transposed would be another word like
that.

1461
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,288
Here it is.
It's the supremum, or

1462
01:09:38,288 --> 01:09:41,850
the maximum, of y transpose x minus f of
x.

1463
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:45,140
Right, so that's, that's what it is.

1464
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,182
Right?
So and, you know, the, there are a lot,

1465
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:52,280
you can give lots of interpretations to
this beautiful interpretations, in fact.

1466
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:52,850
Right?

1467
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,650
Like let's see, you could do something
like this.

1468
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,550
Your minimum,

1469
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:01,975
this could be something Like this f of x
is cost if x is a set of vectors its

1470
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:09,097
a vector that tells you how much of the
say the commodities that you own.

1471
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:11,580
Right f of x tells you your cost.

1472
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,462
I guess economists make it they look at
minus f of x that's your utility.

1473
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,424
Right.

1474
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:18,310
So, we look at f of x.

1475
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,900
F of x is your cost.

1476
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,020
And that's, that's how much it irritates
you to own that amount.

1477
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,420
I mean, if it's negative, I suppose that
means you're happy or something like that.

1478
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,530
But anyway, so that's f of x.

1479
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,780
Then y here has the interpretation of
prices.

1480
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:33,800
So y is a price vector.

1481
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,590
And then what you're seeing is the
following.

1482
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:37,534
It says, if the prices were y,

1483
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:43,410
how much would you, of each of these
things would you?

1484
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,860
How much would you purchase?

1485
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,588
And the answer is, you would take your f
of x,

1486
01:10:46,588 --> 01:10:49,468
that's how irritated you are, and maybe I
got the sign wrong slightly, or

1487
01:10:49,468 --> 01:10:53,590
something, here maybe minus y is the price
vector.

1488
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:57,455
But I would take f of x, and to that I
would add how much I have to pay for it.

1489
01:10:57,455 --> 01:10:59,920
And then I would, I'd minimize that.

1490
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,276
And that would give me the, the least, the
amount that I should buy so that the sum

1491
01:11:04,276 --> 01:11:10,451
of how irritated I am plus how much I had
to pay for the good is minimized.

1492
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:11,112
Right?

1493
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:13,820
And so that's, that's where things like
this come up.

1494
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,480
And it comes up in lots of other fields
too.

1495
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,510
And we'll see things like this so.

1496
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,093
OK.

1497
01:11:19,093 --> 01:11:21,904
So the picture is something like this.

1498
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:24,760
Here's your function, and then what it
says is for,

1499
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,650
to evaluate the conjugate what you do is
you, you take a slope like y.

1500
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:33,740
So we're going to evaluate it at y and we
take a slope like that, x y.

1501
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,374
And then it say we take,

1502
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:41,960
we're going to maximize the difference
between this thing and f of x.

1503
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,560
Right?
And so

1504
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,648
that means you move This way, until you
just touch here.

1505
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:45,240
And then in fact if you simply move over
here,

1506
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,517
that gives you the height of this is the
negative conjugate here.

1507
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:52,237
So, so in fact, in this case, for this
example we could

1508
01:11:52,237 --> 01:12:01,070
even do things, like I could ask you
questions about.

1509
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,640
What happens if I increase y?

1510
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,107
So for example, let me do this.

1511
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:11,690
For this example here if I were to, y is
maybe about 1, here.

1512
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:14,440
And I would like to know, if I make y 2,
what happens to the con,

1513
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,150
what, what is the con, what does the
negative conjugate function do?

1514
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,432
Just visually?

1515
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:21,659
>> What happens?

1516
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:22,777
>> It goes down.

1517
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:24,390
>> It goes down, yup.

1518
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,390
The negative conjugate goes down.

1519
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,124
So what happens is the slope is now two
and

1520
01:12:27,124 --> 01:12:29,840
your point of tangency might be like here.

1521
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,870
And it might go down right down to there.

1522
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:32,730
Right?

1523
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,668
And then that would be, so the negative
conjugate went down or

1524
01:12:34,668 --> 01:12:35,970
the conjugate went up.

1525
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,225
The idea is you can visualize it.

1526
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:40,080
Here's what's kind of cool.

1527
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,092
It turns out that the conjugate of any
function is convex period, any.

1528
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:49,280
Looks like a deep mathematical fact or
something like that.

1529
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,550
It's extremely easy to show.

1530
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,200
Let's show it.

1531
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:58,080
What kind of function of y.

1532
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:58,860
Is that expression.

1533
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,380
What is it?

1534
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,068
It's affine.

1535
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,300
Right.

1536
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,534
I heard someone say linear, that's cool,
because we're among friends here, but

1537
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:06,791
it's affine.

1538
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:10,065
Okay?
No, I mean, you know what I mean, right?

1539
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:11,553
So, it's affine.

1540
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,461
okay, so affine, an affine function is,
and

1541
01:13:13,461 --> 01:13:17,105
this is critical, because we're going to
promote it to something.

1542
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:19,800
Convex.

1543
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,880
So, I can also promote it to concave, by
the way.

1544
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,010
That's what it mean to be [INAUDIBLE],
'cause you're both.

1545
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,420
I'll promote it to convex.

1546
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:31,290
This says, take the supremum parameterized
by x of a family of convex functions.

1547
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:34,710
In fact, they're [INAUDIBLE].
Well, the supremum of any family.

1548
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,818
Of convex functions as convex, so this is
convex, period.

1549
01:13:38,818 --> 01:13:39,904
Right?

1550
01:13:39,904 --> 01:13:43,785
So, okay, so that, that's the the
conjugate.

1551
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:44,980
Okay.

1552
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,880
Some examples, you can work these out.

1553
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,742
I mean, it's a bit silly right now, but I
mean, you should look, go,

1554
01:13:49,742 --> 01:13:52,710
go through this once, but then later
we'll, this will also Be just as

1555
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:56,367
completely central part of the course, so
if you take the negative logarhtm you

1556
01:13:56,367 --> 01:14:02,960
would have to for example calculate what
this and you'd work out what that was.

1557
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,360
I mean it turns out if y is bigger or

1558
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,510
equal to zero the answer is when you take
the supremum its plus infinity.

1559
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,320
If y is negative though you can work out
what this is.

1560
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,942
You can work out what the optimal x what
the optimal x is and so on and so

1561
01:14:14,942 --> 01:14:17,240
forth you get that expression.

1562
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,504
Here's an interesting one.

1563
01:14:18,504 --> 01:14:21,980
Take convex quadratic.

1564
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,940
So, that's one half ex transpose q x.

1565
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,250
And then you calculate the supreme of
this.

1566
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,030
Well, this is easy to do, you just set the
gradient equal to zero.

1567
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,900
Because that's, everything's got, got the
right curvature.

1568
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,620
And it turns out The answer is this.

1569
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:40,156
So the conjugate of a quadratic form is
the quadratic form with

1570
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:42,740
the inverse matrix, right.

1571
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:45,885
So there's, and we'll see there's lots of
intersting things going on here.

1572
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:51,045
So now what we're going to do is we're
going to talk about two three, sorry,

1573
01:14:51,045 --> 01:14:55,050
three extensions of convexity.

1574
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,450
Right, so there's actually, like, tons.

1575
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,561
Like, 20 or 30 different extensions, and
they have all sorts of names like

1576
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:05,398
quasi-convex, pseudo-convex, you know,
quasipseudo-convex, generalized convex.

1577
01:15:05,398 --> 01:15:08,640
Generalized, quasi, pseudoconvex and so
on.

1578
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,200
And, and often in these books somewhere
around page 500 there's usually a diagram.

1579
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,910
So, now we get a very clear picture.

1580
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,386
And there's going to be like 20 different
things and

1581
01:15:17,386 --> 01:15:19,114
you'll say now we see that a pseudoconvex,
Schur-convex,

1582
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,699
quasiconvex function is also such-and-such
convex.

1583
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:25,079
Anyway, so, alright, so

1584
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:32,130
Some of these extensions are useful.

1585
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:34,503
others, maybe not so much.

1586
01:15:34,503 --> 01:15:36,790
so, done a bunch of triage here.

1587
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:41,510
And come down to a handful that are
actually useful, like three, okay?

1588
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,160
And they're, they're fairly natural.

1589
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,030
But we'll, these are things that are
going to come up all the time.

1590
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,872
So, quasi convex is one.

1591
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:50,530
And a function is quasi convex.

1592
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,720
what that means is this it says that the
sublevel sets are convex that,

1593
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,630
that's all it means.

1594
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:58,194
Oh another name for this is uni-modal.

1595
01:15:58,194 --> 01:16:00,074
So in probability it would be referred to
as unimodal and

1596
01:16:00,074 --> 01:16:01,692
maybe some other fields too.

1597
01:16:01,692 --> 01:16:07,210
Right so and, and for example for a scalar
function it just means the following.

1598
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:11,928
It says that if I slice the function at
any level and I look at the sublevel sets.

1599
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,210
Well, in R, I get an interval.

1600
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,130
But it could be half.

1601
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:17,590
You know?
Like, for example, when I slice at beta.

1602
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:20,130
I should get, I get a half, infinite
interval.

1603
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:21,282
I mean I get a, well, yeah.

1604
01:16:21,282 --> 01:16:23,812
F, an infinite interval right?

1605
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,498
Everybody got this?

1606
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:29,710
And it's not hard to figure out what the
condition for quasi convexity is in R.

1607
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:34,820
It's basically that it is monotone
decreasing up to some point.

1608
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,770
And then, well, monotone non-increasing,
and

1609
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,550
then monotone non-decreasing to the right
of it.

1610
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,180
That's it.

1611
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,660
And that, by the way that justifies this
ideal of unimodal, right?

1612
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,450
That it can't have 2 bumps, right?

1613
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,613
That's what it can't have.

1614
01:16:46,613 --> 01:16:47,151
Okay.
So,

1615
01:16:47,151 --> 01:16:51,645
that's a quasi-convex function,
quasi-concave is the negative.

1616
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,515
And quasi-linear is both.

1617
01:16:53,515 --> 01:16:54,690
Okay?

1618
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,990
So let's look at some examples.

1619
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,380
Well the square root of the absolute value
of x.

1620
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,670
That's a function that looks like this.

1621
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,270
Right?

1622
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,550
And that is definitely not convex, and
it's definitely not concave.

1623
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,022
But it's quasiconvex.

1624
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:09,696
Right?
Because sublevel sets if

1625
01:17:09,696 --> 01:17:12,468
you draw a level here is just an interval.

1626
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,728
So you're okay.

1627
01:17:14,728 --> 01:17:17,638
Here's one, the ceiling.

1628
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:20,930
So that's, that's the integer part, right?

1629
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:24,950
Or the, into the next, the integer that's,
that's bigger than the given function.

1630
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,940
That, that's pretty weird.

1631
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,470
Because that thing is integer valued,
right?

1632
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,810
And you don't have very many integer
valued convex functions.

1633
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,440
We have a couple, but they're really
silly.

1634
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,240
Right, mostly they're constant, right, and
not interesting, right.

1635
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,700
But that says you can be, the ceiling of a
function is, is quasilinear.

1636
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,808
You'll see some more interesting examples
in certainly in the book and

1637
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,937
in homeworks and in things like that.

1638
01:17:47,937 --> 01:17:50,700
Log x is quasilinear.

1639
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,786
So it's both, a monotone function is both
quasiconcave and quasiconvex.

1640
01:17:54,786 --> 01:17:58,390
Here's one, x1 x2.

1641
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:59,710
That's a product.

1642
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,369
That's definitely not convex.

1643
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:03,330
It's not concave.

1644
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,040
In fact, it's hessian, right?

1645
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,640
That's a quadratic form, right.

1646
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,270
And the hessian, the hessian is just this
right?

1647
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:10,895
It's like that.

1648
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:15,550
And matrices like that, clearly, it
clearly has split eigen values.

1649
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,568
Right?
It's got a positive one and

1650
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:17,300
a negative one.

1651
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,670
And that tells you, kind of, like where if
you're looking at a function closely.

1652
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:21,460
Well globally.

1653
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,230
Cause it's actually a quadratic form.

1654
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,423
It says that in one direction, it goes
like that, and

1655
01:18:25,423 --> 01:18:27,800
in another direction, it curves up.

1656
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,535
It's a saddle point.

1657
01:18:28,535 --> 01:18:29,830
Everywhere.

1658
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:30,690
Right.
That's the curvature.

1659
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:34,860
So that thing is for sure not convex, not
concave.

1660
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,510
But it is quasi-concave.

1661
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:42,526
And to test that, you'd say what is the --
what are the points that look like this,

1662
01:18:42,526 --> 01:18:46,420
right, x1, x2 is bigger Than t.

1663
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,024
That's the hypo yeah this is not the
hypograph,

1664
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:53,200
sorry this is the super-level set, not the
sub-level set.

1665
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,930
Oh, and of course we have to have x i
positive.

1666
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:56,640
Right?

1667
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,250
That set looks like this.

1668
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,250
That's all these things.

1669
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,090
That's all this stuff over here.

1670
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:06,705
Alright, and for any t that's going to be
convex.

1671
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:07,720
Okay?

1672
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,091
So that's it.

1673
01:19:09,091 --> 01:19:13,634
There's a lot of other ones, a very famous
one is linear-fractional, so

1674
01:19:13,634 --> 01:19:17,230
a ratio of two affine functions.

1675
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:22,330
Notice it's called linear-fractional, but
that's already ingrained in the in, in, in

1676
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:29,130
standard mathematical speech, so, anyway,
linear-fractional functions Are quasi.

1677
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,980
They are going to be actually quasilinear.

1678
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,936
Right?
Because if

1679
01:19:32,936 --> 01:19:38,660
you ask what are the points where f is
bigger than sum value t.

1680
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,730
Right?
Or less than sum value t.

1681
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,030
All you do is you take the denominator,
put it on the other side.

1682
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:44,280
And you get a linear inequality.

1683
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,370
So you get a half space.

1684
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:46,155
Everybody got that?

1685
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:51,488
So I just said that, but that's, you'd,
you'd want to check on that.

1686
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:52,939
Okay.

1687
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:55,530
here, let's look at one that's real.

1688
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,640
So is internal rate of return.

1689
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:02,164
So here, a vector x represents a cash
flow.

1690
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:08,565
And it's, the sign is it's if, if it's a,
if it's cash coming in, it's positive.

1691
01:20:08,565 --> 01:20:09,200
Okay?

1692
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,890
So that's, it's a cash flow, right?

1693
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,184
So, and then lots of things would look
like you could write out all sorts of

1694
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,398
financial instruments.

1695
01:20:16,398 --> 01:20:18,830
As non-, I guess they're non contingent
[INAUDIBLE].

1696
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:21,370
So you could write them out as a cash flow
vector, right?

1697
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:21,910
Right?

1698
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:26,210
Like, if I, if I lend something to someone
else.

1699
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,080
Then what happens is my x zero is
negative.

1700
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,520
And then all my X1s, X1, X2,

1701
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,720
up to Xn, would be principal plus interest
payment, right.

1702
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,117
An interest only thing would look like I
have X0 if I,

1703
01:20:38,117 --> 01:20:42,410
if I borrow interest only, X0 is positive.

1704
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,345
I then have,.

1705
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:44,852
You know?

1706
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:45,856
Negative things.

1707
01:20:45,856 --> 01:20:47,920
'Cuz I'm, I'm paying the interest.

1708
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,060
And then on the last step, the last one, I
would pay off the principal, right?

1709
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,170
So something like that, right?

1710
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:55,280
And you can do all of these things, right?

1711
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,350
An amortized loan.

1712
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,740
All these kind of things, right?

1713
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,240
Okay.

1714
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,481
Set a cash flow, it's a vector.

1715
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:04,300
So we're going to assume x zero is
negative.

1716
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,070
That means.

1717
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,500
We're going to make an investment.

1718
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,650
That's, that's, that's cash weak, so on
the zero thing, we're going to invest.

1719
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,980
And you can turn it around too, it doesn't
matter.

1720
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,100
But we're going to invest.

1721
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,035
In amount x zero.

1722
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,750
And, you should interpret x one, x two, x
three.

1723
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,150
Those are payments to us.

1724
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,230
I mean, if they're positive.

1725
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,350
We hope they are.

1726
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,450
Right.
By the way, they might not be there.

1727
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,730
There might be further investments.

1728
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,732
But if they're positive, the idea is that,
those are, we make an investment of x0 and

1729
01:21:26,732 --> 01:21:29,290
then x1, x2, x3, up to xn.

1730
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,882
That's money that comes back in.

1731
01:21:31,882 --> 01:21:33,069
Okay.

1732
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:36,890
Well if you have an interest rate r And
you discount these cash flows.

1733
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,402
Then this'd be the present value,

1734
01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:41,835
right, it's just the sum of 1 plus r to
the minus i, xi.

1735
01:21:41,835 --> 01:21:45,195
Right, because the i is indexing periods
in the future and

1736
01:21:45,195 --> 01:21:49,032
you discount each one by the interest
rate.

1737
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:52,272
Okay, so, that's the so called present
value and

1738
01:21:52,272 --> 01:21:58,520
it's a function of the cash flow vector
and the rate Interest rate.

1739
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,050
Now the internal rate of return, of a cash
flow vector or

1740
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,650
investment sequence here, is this.

1741
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:06,822
It's the smallest, by the way it's not
said this way because people are not

1742
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:10,202
clear about these things and it's usually
wrong and all that kind of stuff, but

1743
01:22:10,202 --> 01:22:15,050
in fact this is the correct, this is the
correct way to say it.

1744
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:19,472
They say this: it's the interest rate
which makes the present value 0.

1745
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:20,744
Okay?

1746
01:22:20,744 --> 01:22:23,610
So that, that's, that's the idea, right?

1747
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,820
So, that's silly.

1748
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:28,384
Because if this thing, this thing here
could actually be zero for

1749
01:22:28,384 --> 01:22:31,200
multiple values of r.

1750
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,930
In which case, it's the smallest one,
right?

1751
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:38,980
So it's the smallest interest rate which
makes the present value zero, right?

1752
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,430
And so the idea is something like this.

1753
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,696
If you make a good investment, it means.

1754
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:44,882
X0, you don't put in, your initial
investment is not very much and

1755
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:47,540
lots of stuff comes back to you.

1756
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:50,470
And it comes back to you so fast that even
when you, when you...

1757
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:55,340
It takes a lot of discounting to make it
look like the net present value is zero.

1758
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,045
So that's the idea.

1759
01:22:56,045 --> 01:22:58,920
Okay, so this is the internal rate of
return.

1760
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,690
That's really quite complicated as a
function if you think about it Right,

1761
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:06,228
in fact if you really, the only way you'd
be able to do this would be to do

1762
01:23:06,228 --> 01:23:10,056
something like even compute you well you
take x and you might do somehting where

1763
01:23:10,056 --> 01:23:17,430
you try some internal rate of return and,
and, and look at and you vary it.

1764
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:20,560
Or calculate the internal rate of return
over 100 values or something like that.

1765
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,440
That would give you the internal rate of
return to some accuracy right.

1766
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,264
You'd find where its slightly negative and
one where its slightly positive and OK.

1767
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:29,120
It's a complicated function.

1768
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:32,276
But it turns out it's quasiconcave.

1769
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:34,080
So, quasiconcave says this.

1770
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,085
It says the internal rate of return of a
cash flow sequence, right,

1771
01:23:39,085 --> 01:23:43,830
exceeds some number r, say, 10%, right?

1772
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,890
That's true, if and only if the following
is true.

1773
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:52,645
For all, for all, discount factors up to
That 10% value, right?

1774
01:23:52,645 --> 01:24:02,400
The net present values is positive, right,
so that's the, that's the idea, okay?

1775
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,070
That, that, that would give it to you.

1776
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:08,815
This as a function of x, what is that
actually, geometrically?

1777
01:24:08,815 --> 01:24:13,516
>> This inequality for a fixed value of r,
what does that look like?

1778
01:24:13,516 --> 01:24:15,918
In, in cash flow space?

1779
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,330
>> Polyhedron.

1780
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:18,602
>> It's what?

1781
01:24:18,602 --> 01:24:21,005
For a fixed value of r?

1782
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,490
>> [INAUDIBLE] No, it's, it's a
polyhedron, I agree, but

1783
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,880
it's, it's sim, much simpler.

1784
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,236
What is it?
>> Halfspace.

1785
01:24:25,236 --> 01:24:26,180
>> Halfspace.

1786
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,608
Yeah.
It's an open halfspace.

1787
01:24:27,608 --> 01:24:31,007
Okay?
So that's an open halfspace.

1788
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:33,359
And then this say's you have to take the
intersection of o,

1789
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,711
of an infinite number of open half spa,
half spaces and

1790
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:39,800
you get, in fact in that, turns out the
answer's closed.

1791
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,990
But that's irrelevant.

1792
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:44,012
So you take the int-, intersection of the
infinite number of half spaces.

1793
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,330
And then that's actually going to be your
super level set.

1794
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:50,590
And that basically is saying The
interpretation of this is beautiful.

1795
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:54,154
It says these are the cash flow sequences
which have an internal,

1796
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:58,240
intenral rate of return exceeding let's
say 10%.

1797
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,890
Right, it's not all of them of course.

1798
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:03,050
There's a whole bunch of crappy cash flow
sequences, there's good ones.

1799
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,320
But the boys, it says that the super level
set.

1800
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,800
Is convex.

1801
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,156
Right?
And that means this thing is

1802
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:09,180
quasi-concave.

1803
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,099
Now I, I'm moving fast.

1804
01:25:11,099 --> 01:25:14,304
There's no way you could get all of this
right here.

1805
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:18,882
So the idea more or less here is just to
get kind of the idea and the flavor of it.

1806
01:25:18,882 --> 01:25:20,750
Okay.

1807
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:24,288
So let's look at some properties of
quasiconvex functions.

1808
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:26,740
The first is, you have a modified Jensen
inequality.

1809
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,545
In stead of saying that f, if you evaluate
it at a mixture of points,

1810
01:25:29,545 --> 01:25:32,452
is less than the corresponding mixture of
f values, instead of that,

1811
01:25:32,452 --> 01:25:35,410
this says you just write max.

1812
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,170
And so the picture is, is kind of cool.

1813
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,020
It's this, right?

1814
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,292
Here's a, here's a generic quasiconvex
function.

1815
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:41,940
Like that.

1816
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,600
And what it, so

1817
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,580
convexity, let me take some points where
it's definitely not convex.

1818
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,510
There.
Okay?

1819
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:51,010
So if I take those two points, that's X,
right?

1820
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:51,730
That's Y.

1821
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,600
And let me just take the midpoint, that's
A equals a half.

1822
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,540
And we can see that by Jenson's
inequality, we're not doing well here.

1823
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,835
It's, it's not, it's violated.

1824
01:26:00,835 --> 01:26:02,190
Right, OK.

1825
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,026
However, what this says is that if I draw,

1826
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:07,730
it says that instead of lying, you don't
have to lie.

1827
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,610
The function doesn't have to be below the
cord connecting these two points on

1828
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:11,740
the graph.

1829
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,950
It has to be below this box,

1830
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:18,100
which is kind of goes from whatever the
taller of one of them is and then down.

1831
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,460
Right, so it has to sit under there.

1832
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,862
That's a, that's a quasiconvex function.

1833
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,220
There's first order conditions and

1834
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,056
I think we'll, we'll come back to this
later in the course, but

1835
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,020
it's basically something like this.

1836
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:32,209
It says that, it says that if f of y is
less than f of x then the gradient of f

1837
01:26:32,209 --> 01:26:36,860
of x transpose y minus x is less than
zero.

1838
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,230
So these, these might be the sublevel sets
of a quaziconvex function.

1839
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:44,460
And it says that if If that is the
gradient, right?

1840
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:48,438
Then it says that all points that are, had
a lower value of F,

1841
01:26:48,438 --> 01:26:51,975
lie in this half space, okay?

1842
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:55,030
So, there are some things you have to
worry about.

1843
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,530
Things like this.

1844
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:58,690
Sums of quasi functions are not quasi
convex.

1845
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:01,310
And extreme, I'll just draw the, I'll draw
the picture.

1846
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:02,760
And that's the end of the story.

1847
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,796
So here's the picture.

1848
01:27:03,796 --> 01:27:08,040
There, there's a quasiconvex function.

1849
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,915
And here's another one.

1850
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:10,090
Okay?

1851
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,450
And now add them together in your head
please and

1852
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:15,450
you will see a non-quasiconvex function.

1853
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:19,650
Right.
Or maybe clearer, a non-unimodal function.

1854
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,540
Right, because you'll see something that's
got two bumps.

1855
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,940
You, you draw your sublevel set right at
the right thing.

1856
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,990
You get two intervals or whatever you like
as the sublevel set and it's all over.

1857
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,701
Okay?

1858
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:29,489
So.
Okay.

1859
01:27:29,489 --> 01:27:32,137
Next generalization.

1860
01:27:32,137 --> 01:27:38,016
This is going to be two out of our three,
is log concave.

1861
01:27:38,016 --> 01:27:43,930
Actually the, the quasi-convex stuff is
actually fairly straight.

1862
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,774
Forward.
It just introduces some notation for

1863
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:48,766
some stuff that's obvious, will solve a
lot of problems that are quasi convex, and

1864
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:50,520
things like that.

1865
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,547
We'll get to that later.

1866
01:27:51,547 --> 01:27:53,591
Log convexity, and by the way, for

1867
01:27:53,591 --> 01:27:59,994
some weird reason, it comes up what's
interesting always is log concavity.

1868
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:03,980
This is not a simple extension.

1869
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:07,090
It, it, there are some things here that
are not obvious at all.

1870
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:10,030
It's, It's kind of, it appears to be quite
deep.

1871
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:12,900
So, a function is log-concave if its log
is concave.

1872
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,245
I mean that's just.

1873
01:28:16,245 --> 01:28:18,150
That's what it means, very simple.

1874
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:19,558
And what that means is this.

1875
01:28:19,558 --> 01:28:20,780
Another way to say that is this.

1876
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:26,582
It says that, it says that if you evaluate
f at a mixture of two points x and y.

1877
01:28:26,582 --> 01:28:32,660
The f-, if it were concave, it would be
bigger than the mixture of the f values.

1878
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,350
But here what it says is, it's bigger than
the geometric mixture.

1879
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,922
Geo, weighted geometric mean, however you
want to call that.

1880
01:28:39,922 --> 01:28:40,734
Okay?

1881
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:41,750
So that's what it says.

1882
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:45,160
And you take the log of this, and that,
that's what it means to be concave.

1883
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,751
Okay, so it's log-convex if log, if the
log of the function is convex, and

1884
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:51,885
if the function's obviously positive.

1885
01:28:51,885 --> 01:28:54,999
So, examples would be powers.

1886
01:28:54,999 --> 01:28:57,698
But this is actually where it really comes
up.

1887
01:28:57,698 --> 01:29:00,320
And we'll see this later in great detail.

1888
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:06,830
It turns out, tons of common probability
densities, are log concave.

1889
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:11,998
Right so that, that's going to be
completely, I mean, tons, that, it takes

1890
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:19,067
you a while to even think of a named
distribution that is not log concave.

1891
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,781
You can, I mean especially if you're in
statistics, but

1892
01:29:21,781 --> 01:29:27,260
Generally speaking, there, all the ones
you bump into, they are all log concave.

1893
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:30,320
And it's going to have huge implications
later in the class when we do statistical

1894
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,980
methods and estimation and things like
that.

1895
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,420
And they're going to be good.

1896
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,330
The consequences.

1897
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:39,300
So here's one.

1898
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:45,110
Here is the density, of a normal, random
variable.

1899
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:49,204
With, you know mean X bar and co-variant
sigma.

1900
01:29:49,204 --> 01:29:49,766
Okay?
And

1901
01:29:49,766 --> 01:29:52,880
if I take the log of that density, what do
I get?

1902
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,710
Well I get a constant that's not relevant
minus a, minus a convex quadratic.

1903
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:00,430
So it's a concave quadratic.

1904
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,210
Okay, so that's an example.

1905
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:06,485
By the way, a uniform distribution, on a
convex set.

1906
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:11,890
Right, so any uniform distri, uniform
distribution on any convex set.

1907
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:14,380
Has a log concave density, right?

1908
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,980
Because the, here's, let's talk about what
that is.

1909
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,870
If I have a uniform distribution on a, on
a set c.

1910
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:23,742
Then the density is a constant on c.

1911
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:26,090
And then off of c, the density is zero.

1912
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,440
You take logs.

1913
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,650
It says the log of the dens-, the log
density is a constant.

1914
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,520
It's a log of the original constant,
right, on c.

1915
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,380
And then it goes to minus infinity.

1916
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:39,667
And you visualize that in your head and
you realize that's concave.

1917
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,312
Okay?
And

1918
01:30:40,312 --> 01:30:43,180
in fact that's really the extended value
of extension.

1919
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,561
Right?
So, so, that's another one.

1920
01:30:45,561 --> 01:30:46,786
And here's one.

1921
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:48,990
This is much less obvious.

1922
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:53,286
The cumulative distribution function, of a
Gaussian.

1923
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:55,990
Okay?
So that's, that is log concave.

1924
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,930
Right, so that, that's something.

1925
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,369
That looks like this, right?

1926
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:02,240
It goes like that, like that.

1927
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,180
And so that.

1928
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:06,415
So something like, things with, like these
[INAUDIBLE] shapes.

1929
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:08,130
These, many of these.

1930
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,200
Well, actually, the cumulative density of
any,.

1931
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,160
Well, log concave density is, is log
concave.

1932
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,050
But we'll get to that, right?

1933
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,632
So, [INAUDIBLE] when you look at that,
that does not look.

1934
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:20,560
Concave, right?

1935
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,260
So what you have to do is you look at that
thing.

1936
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,220
And you take the log in your head, right?

1937
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,300
And when you take the log in your head,
here's what happens.

1938
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,990
You know, that's, like, a half, right?

1939
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:30,150
That's one.

1940
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,200
And this is going down to zero.

1941
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,190
And so what the log does is over here.

1942
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,610
It, it takes that part of the curve and
bends it down.

1943
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:37,082
And what you get is a quadratic.

1944
01:31:37,082 --> 01:31:39,025
OK, so you just get a quadratic,

1945
01:31:39,025 --> 01:31:44,866
sorry you get something that approaches a
quadratic I'm sorry in this case OK.

1946
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:48,545
So this would give you some something like
that OK.

1947
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:52,833
Now let's look at osme properties of these
well the first is, if you have a,

1948
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,521
I mean one condition is this you, you can
say that a,

1949
01:31:55,521 --> 01:32:02,600
a twice differentiable f with convex I
mean its log concave if and only if.

1950
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,910
This inequality holds and we can rewrite
this another way.

1951
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,050
We can write it this way.

1952
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:11,280
I'll just erase this part.

1953
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,470
If this inequality,

1954
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:17,905
now concave would be if the right hand
side of this expression were zero.

1955
01:32:17,905 --> 01:32:18,950
Right?

1956
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,810
If that was the zero matrix, that would be
a concave function.

1957
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:25,320
It says, it says the Hessian function is
negative semidefinite.

1958
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:32,820
Here though, you allow the Hessian to be
less than or equal to a rank one matrix.

1959
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,701
Right?
So you have to

1960
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:37,753
know a few things with what I'm about to
say, but I'll say it anyway.

1961
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:43,250
That says you can have one eigenvalue of
the [INAUDIBLE] can be positive.

1962
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:45,308
And you can still be log concave, okay?

1963
01:32:45,308 --> 01:32:47,758
Okay.
Now, how do I know that.

1964
01:32:47,758 --> 01:32:51,085
Well, if a matrix is less than a rank one
matrix.

1965
01:32:51,085 --> 01:32:54,650
.Then, in fact, all its eigenvalues but
one.

1966
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:58,420
Are, are less or equal to 0.

1967
01:32:58,420 --> 01:32:59,458
Okay?
So, and this is just to

1968
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:01,270
give you some flavor at this.

1969
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,350
So, it says that more is allowed.

1970
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,649
And in fact we already saw that earlier,
right?

1971
01:33:05,649 --> 01:33:09,049
So, here is an example where clearly here,
the second derivative is positive, but

1972
01:33:09,049 --> 01:33:12,442
if you take that log, and it ends up being
negative.

1973
01:33:12,442 --> 01:33:15,940
OK, here's one.

1974
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,925
Let's see.
Product of log-concave functions is log,

1975
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,669
that's trivial because if you take the
product of two functions and

1976
01:33:20,669 --> 01:33:25,790
take the log, this basically says that the
sum of two concave functions is concave.

1977
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:26,874
So this is easy.

1978
01:33:26,874 --> 01:33:31,920
The sum of log-concave functions, that's
not always log-concave.

1979
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,820
So in probability that means that a
mixture distribution with

1980
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:41,020
log-concave distributions is not
necessarily log-concave.

1981
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,400
That's totally obvious, right?

1982
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,393
Because look, here's a galsion, here's
another galsion.

1983
01:33:45,393 --> 01:33:47,813
You take the sum or the average to get the
mixture distribution and

1984
01:33:47,813 --> 01:33:50,022
it, it's definitely not log-concave.

1985
01:33:50,022 --> 01:33:52,282
Okay?

1986
01:33:52,282 --> 01:33:54,560
And then here's a very interesting one.

1987
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,111
Integration.

1988
01:33:55,111 --> 01:33:58,991
If you have a function that takes two, two
var-.

1989
01:33:58,991 --> 01:34:02,619
Two block, I block the argument into two
things.

1990
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:06,450
And I integrate over one of a set of
variables.

1991
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,620
So, I, so this is like partial
minimization.

1992
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,232
But this is partial integration.

1993
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:09,906
Okay.

1994
01:34:09,906 --> 01:34:14,000
If I do that the result is log concave.

1995
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,510
So the, the, if I integrate out over, and
it, you know, by the way, this would be,

1996
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:22,500
this would actually, this is part of
conditioning or something like that.

1997
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,610
In, in, a dense, if you'd like to think of
it that way.

1998
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:28,280
And what that says is this thing is logged
concave.

1999
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,530
The integral is logged concave.

2000
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,300
We'll look at that.

2001
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,620
By the way.

2002
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,436
For that fact,

2003
01:34:32,436 --> 01:34:37,110
I'm [INAUDIBLE], I am unaware of an
elementary derivation of this.

2004
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,610
So, here's some consequences.

2005
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:41,260
It turns out that, because of the
integral.

2006
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,950
[INAUDIBLE] it turns out the convolution
is log concave.

2007
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,430
Is preserved from, that's very interesting
for

2008
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,680
probability densities, 'cuz this says the
following.

2009
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,075
It says that if I have two.

2010
01:34:49,075 --> 01:34:52,510
Random variables, each with a log-concave
probability distribution.

2011
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:56,800
Then the sum of those random variables
also, whose density is the convolution,

2012
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,960
it says that sums of, it says random, if
you take sums of random variables with

2013
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:07,776
log-concave distributions, you get a
log-concave distributions preserved.

2014
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,527
Right?

2015
01:35:08,527 --> 01:35:09,692
Here's one.

2016
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:11,960
This is a very interesting one.

2017
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,940
This is alone just has huge applications.

2018
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,508
It's this If you have a convex set.

2019
01:35:19,508 --> 01:35:24,350
And I have a random variable with a log
concave pdf, then the following is true.

2020
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,540
I make a function which is this.

2021
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:28,720
This is actually called the yield function
option like in manufacturing.

2022
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,660
It's the probability.

2023
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,670
So I have a set that looks like this.

2024
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,874
Here's my set c.

2025
01:35:33,874 --> 01:35:38,010
And what I do is I, to evaluate my
function, I take x and

2026
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:43,180
then to that I add this random variable.

2027
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:45,116
Okay, so I, it doesn't matter lets make it
galcion or,

2028
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:47,888
it doesn't really matter, it's some
galcion and it's spread around here, so

2029
01:35:47,888 --> 01:35:51,220
Let it, you know, it would, I'll try to
draw it.

2030
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,660
I don't know how to draw a distribution,
but it looks something like that, right?

2031
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,894
There's a little volcano that kind of goes
up, and you, and then what, the point is

2032
01:35:56,894 --> 01:36:02,000
now, you look at that as a, what you do is
you take the total probability in the set.

2033
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,690
Right?
And then you move that target point, x.

2034
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:05,765
You can think of it that way.

2035
01:36:05,765 --> 01:36:08,840
And it changes with the yield, right?

2036
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,296
So the application of this is pretty
simple: C is a set of values of

2037
01:36:12,296 --> 01:36:16,080
some parameters that are acceptable,
right?

2038
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,796
So it's you -- you build a chip or
something like that,

2039
01:36:17,796 --> 01:36:20,487
and it means that the final thing actually
does clock at this rate and last this long

2040
01:36:20,487 --> 01:36:24,426
or something li- -- it doesn't ma- -- it's
some manufacturing problem.

2041
01:36:24,426 --> 01:36:26,670
Everybody got it?

2042
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:30,240
Then y is just the, the variations in
manufacture.

2043
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,969
Just uncontrolled, right?

2044
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:35,838
Critical dimensions, things like that it,
your ability to control the process, and

2045
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,588
things like that.

2046
01:36:37,588 --> 01:36:40,778
I mean, that, you're pushing everything to
the absolute limit, so

2047
01:36:40,778 --> 01:36:43,050
it's not like you can, yeah.

2048
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:44,502
If, if the distribution is super tight,

2049
01:36:44,502 --> 01:36:47,290
then you're not doing high-end
manufacturing.

2050
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:47,840
Right.
You could be

2051
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,030
pushing this way harder, right?

2052
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:51,180
So, you push it and it looks like that.

2053
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,950
Then, the problem of choosing x is the
target point that you set your machines,

2054
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:58,120
your manufacturing machines to do.

2055
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,550
You say please target this.

2056
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,474
And you know, look, if you target it out
here,

2057
01:37:02,474 --> 01:37:05,010
that's like really dumb [LAUGH], right?

2058
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:09,600
Because basically, most of the time, the
thing, comes, it doesn't work at all.

2059
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,260
By the way, every now and then, it works.

2060
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:11,820
Right?

2061
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:14,892
Because every now and then, a random
manufacturing fluctuation will come up

2062
01:37:14,892 --> 01:37:17,970
with that point and you'll have one
working device.

2063
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:19,540
Everybody following this, right?

2064
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,458
So, that, that point,

2065
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:24,360
this point here would not be a
particularly good choice yield wise.

2066
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,271
Okay?

2067
01:37:25,271 --> 01:37:30,353
And so then, obvious question is how do
you What target point would you choose to

2068
01:37:30,353 --> 01:37:33,720
maximize the yield, right?

2069
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:37,248
And it takes very little imagination to
realize actually how much,

2070
01:37:37,248 --> 01:37:42,930
how actually, how much this would actually
mean in certain contexts right.

2071
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,870
I mean it's incredibly important, right.

2072
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:47,378
And so the idea's there, do you want to,
it's going to be somewhere in the,

2073
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:51,840
what this says is that function, the log
of that yield function.

2074
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,060
Is actually concave.

2075
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:56,720
That says we'll be able to maximize it,
right?

2076
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,860
So it's, that's going to be a convex
optimization problem.

2077
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,150
That means we can effectively solve that
problem, right?

2078
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:05,132
So, so just this little thing already has
like serious implications.

2079
01:38:05,132 --> 01:38:08,740
So how do you show something like that?

2080
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:10,430
Well, you just set it up for this integral
thing.

2081
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:11,762
And so the way you do it is this.

2082
01:38:11,762 --> 01:38:15,520
You write this thing, the thing that we're
interested in, as the following.

2083
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,920
As it's an integral of two things, the
product of two things.

2084
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:23,130
Actually and, these things are the
following.

2085
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:25,600
So p is, are that's the density of y.

2086
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,990
And g is this weird function, that's like
one or zero.

2087
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:29,570
Right?

2088
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,930
Both of those functions are log concave.

2089
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:33,120
Right, p by assumption.

2090
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,340
G is because g is, actually, it's silly.

2091
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:39,418
It's log zero on, on, on c, and then it's
minus infinity outside c,

2092
01:38:39,418 --> 01:38:44,210
that's a con, it's silly, but it's a
convex fun, a concave function.

2093
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,855
Right?
Product of two log-concave Integral over

2094
01:38:46,855 --> 01:38:50,443
some of the variables in this case just y
that's log concave and

2095
01:38:50,443 --> 01:38:54,670
this is what you have so that's the idea.

2096
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:58,930
OK, so I think we already talked about
this, this is the idea.

2097
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:05,140
And this says that the yield the log of
the yield function is, is concave.

2098
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:07,078
So and by the way we don't know that yet
but

2099
01:39:07,078 --> 01:39:11,264
we'll see later that means that basically
we can effectively.

2100
01:39:11,264 --> 01:39:12,577
Maximizing, right?

2101
01:39:12,577 --> 01:39:15,080
So, by the way a lot of weird things
happen this way.

2102
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:19,045
Where there's an asymmetry between what
you want to do with something and

2103
01:39:19,045 --> 01:39:24,450
there's a, and there's also a asymmetry in
what you can and cannot do.

2104
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:26,350
This is a perfect example.

2105
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:27,360
Right?

2106
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,300
You take a yield function, there's a
strong asymmetry here.

2107
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,970
You want to maximize it.

2108
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,115
You don't want to minimize it.

2109
01:39:34,115 --> 01:39:36,087
Well, you can turn everything around and

2110
01:39:36,087 --> 01:39:39,683
mini, that'll be you want to, the set C
will be some terrible outcome and

2111
01:39:39,683 --> 01:39:44,515
you want to maximize, you want to avoid
it, but, anyway.

2112
01:39:44,515 --> 01:39:48,160
And it turns out, it's concave, that's
something we can maximize.

2113
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,435
If it were convex, we cannot.

2114
01:39:49,435 --> 01:39:51,175
So, okay.

2115
01:39:51,175 --> 01:39:54,955
And our final, generalization X functions
is,

2116
01:39:54,955 --> 01:40:00,092
to generalize it to the idea of, vector
values.

2117
01:40:00,092 --> 01:40:00,934
Right? So here are the ideas. I'll take a
function which takes, you know,

2118
01:40:00,934 --> 01:40:01,435
as usual a vector argument.

2119
01:40:01,435 --> 01:40:02,920
But it returns a vector argument, not a
scaler argument.

2120
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:03,937
So I

2121
01:40:03,937 --> 01:40:13,900
take a A vector argument.

2122
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:18,080
And you define a function to be K-convex
if the domain is convex and

2123
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,590
if this Jenson inequality holds.

2124
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:24,825
But it holds with respect to this concave.

2125
01:40:24,825 --> 01:40:26,230
Okay?

2126
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:31,190
Now this mostly only comes up in a couple
of, you know, in, in a couple of ways.

2127
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:37,429
I mean a couple of these are are come up
much more often than other things.

2128
01:40:37,429 --> 01:40:40,503
And so one for example, if this is, if
this is matrix inequalities, and

2129
01:40:40,503 --> 01:40:43,736
these are symmetric matrices, and that's
matrix inequality, then this,

2130
01:40:43,736 --> 01:40:47,181
a function that is K-convex with respect
to the positive semi-definite cone,

2131
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:50,670
that's called matrix convex.

2132
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:53,370
So, that's.

2133
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:57,906
So here, for example, if I've a mapping
from m by m symmetric matrices, into m

2134
01:40:57,906 --> 01:41:04,890
by m symmetric matrices, and the mapping
is the following, you square the matrix.

2135
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,620
That's it.

2136
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:10,745
Then, the claim is that is convex, matrix
convex.

2137
01:41:10,745 --> 01:41:11,870
Okay?

2138
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:12,970
And.

2139
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:14,200
What you have to check is this.

2140
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:19,184
You want to check here, whether or not you
have to check whether z

2141
01:41:19,184 --> 01:41:26,670
transpose X squared z is convex with
respect to capital X, right.

2142
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:28,180
For each Z.

2143
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:29,490
That's what you have to check.

2144
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:32,160
And, that is true because you write it
this way.

2145
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:36,507
And now this expression, capital x times
little z, is actually linear in capital x,

2146
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:39,730
and then you have a norm.

2147
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:41,260
Squared, that's convex.

2148
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:41,890
Okay?

2149
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:46,852
So this, so this expression is convex in
capital x, okay?

2150
01:41:46,852 --> 01:41:49,930
By the way, it kind of suggests that,
right?

2151
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:53,116
I mean, you know, if x squared is your
canonical convex function,

2152
01:41:53,116 --> 01:41:57,920
little x squared Then Y wouldn't capital x
squared become x as well.

2153
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,510
I mean you have to be very careful with
these things because some

2154
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,480
things are wrong.

2155
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,680
For example x, you don't get a whole lot
more.

2156
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,789
I mean that's convex and capital as well.

2157
01:42:05,789 --> 01:42:08,839
And the x of a matrix, symmetric matrix is
actually not a matrix convex so,

2158
01:42:08,839 --> 01:42:11,333
there's some weird stuff happens.

2159
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:16,230
I mean seriously weird stuff so but In
this case it didn't happen.

2160
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:19,740
Okay, now this is true for any z, and that
tells you that I removed the z's and

2161
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,008
I changed this inequality to a matrix
inequality,

2162
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:26,910
because that's what it means for matrix
inequality to hold, right.

2163
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:28,591
It says that if you take the one quadratic
form and

2164
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:32,470
another, this quadratic form is always
less than this one.

2165
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:35,550
That, that's always true, then it means
that this matrix is less or

2166
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:39,358
equal to this one in the matrix sense, and
so you get, you get a statement that looks

2167
01:42:39,358 --> 01:42:45,560
like, like that, okay, so that, that's it,
and this is sophisticated statement.
