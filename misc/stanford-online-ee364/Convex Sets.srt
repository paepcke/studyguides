1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,440
So, in this lecture we're going to talk
about convex sets.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,015
And we'll start with some very basic
definitions like what's an affine set and

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:08,940
what's a convex set.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,640
Then we're going to move we'll look at a,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,595
at a catalog of some very important
examples.

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,520
Things like balls or half spaces or rays.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,200
Things like that.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,164
Then we'll focus a bit on operations that
preserve convexity,

9
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:26,806
that's like the intersection of two sets
or a sum, things like that.

10
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:29,941
And then the basic idea is that will form
a calculus of convex sets,

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,620
you can combine the basic ones with these
operations and

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,203
create quite a lot of interesting convex
sets.

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,680
We'll then move on to generalized
inequalities.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,280
Talk about what that means.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,840
That's in, that's an inequality vector
inequality.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,232
And then we'll talk about some basics
facts from convex analysis.

17
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:54,008
Separating and supporting hydroplanes, and
the idea of duel cones and

18
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,525
generalized inequalities.

19
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:02,250
Okay, so we'll start with the idea of an
affine set.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,450
So we have two points, in our n, in a
vector space, x1 and x2.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,940
And we form another point, we take a,

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,020
a number theta and we form the vector
theta x1 plus 1 minus theta x2.

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,342
That's so it's a linear combination of x1
and x2,

24
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:21,360
but it's a very specific linear
combination.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,044
The two coefficients add up to 1.

26
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,322
'Kay?

27
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:26,650
And geometrically, that looks like this.

28
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,487
If I take theta equals 1 This gives you of
course x 1.

29
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:35,390
If you set theta equals 0 you get x 2.

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,700
If you take theta equals a half you're at
the midpoint that would be

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,279
like right here.

32
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:43,040
And as you vary theta you move along this
line.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,796
Now when theta is negative You're out here
on the extension, past x2 on

34
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:54,891
the way in the direction, in the same
direction that goes from x1 to x2.

35
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,968
And if you take theta bigger than one,

36
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,720
you're on this extension of the line over
here.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,537
If theta is between zero and

38
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:07,690
one, you're on the segment, line segment
between x1 and x2.

39
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,798
Okay, now we define an affine set to be a
set where if

40
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:15,608
you have any two distinct points in the
set then the line that passes through it

41
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:20,339
is contained entirely in the set.

42
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,821
So that's an affine set.

43
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,109
And an example would be very obvious
example is the solution set of a set of

44
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:29,450
linear equations.

45
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,355
So here, if you have two points, different
points that sol, in,

46
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,980
that solve a set of linear equations.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,960
So I have Ax1 equals b.

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,962
S if I have Ax1 equals b, and I have Ax2
equals b,

49
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,596
then The claim is that the line passing
through x one and

50
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:52,490
x two is also in this set which means
satisfies this equality.

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,050
And what that means is we'd have to look
at ax, but

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,940
that's a times theta x one plus one minus
theta x two.

53
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,924
And the question is What is that, and in
particular is it B, and it is,

54
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:12,175
because this is Theta, ax1 plus 1 minus
Theta ax2 and that's Theta b plus

55
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:17,426
1 minus Theta, b and that is b, alright,
so that's the verification that

56
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:26,530
the solutions set of a set of linear
equations...

57
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,900
Is an affine set.

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,860
Now it, turns out the converse is also
true.

59
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,134
That if you have any affine set,

60
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:34,853
it can be written as the solutions set of
a set of linear equations.

61
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:43,020
Okay, this brings us to convex set.

62
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,695
So convex set, it's the same idea.

63
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,640
Except that we talk about the line
segment.

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,962
So the line segment between two points,
these are two vectors and a vector space.

65
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:56,106
That's any linear combination with the
following requirements on

66
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,070
the coefficients.

67
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,720
The coefficients have to add up to one,
that's number one.

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,330
And number two, they have to be bigger
than or equal to zero.

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,479
Another way to say that is they must have
the form theta plus one minus theta where

70
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,730
theta is between zero and one.

71
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,122
And so this is an honest mixture, both of
these two numbers is between zero and

72
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:16,036
one and they add up to one.

73
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,030
Kay', so that's the line segment.

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,580
And a convex set, it's very simple.

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,796
It's any set where it contains a line
segment between any two points that are in

76
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,390
the set.

77
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,380
So if you have two points in the set than
the line segment between them must line

78
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,710
entirely in the set.

79
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,545
Or one other way to say a very simple
would be something like this that if

80
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:39,120
you have a point X1 and a point X2 in a
set there has to be clear line of

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,290
sight path between X1 and X2 within the
set.

82
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,970
So that's idea there's no hidden parts.

83
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,112
Any point in the set can see any other
point in the set.

84
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:53,930
So an example of a convex set.

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,797
Is this this set here and so here I take
any two points,

86
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,726
indeed the line segment between them fits
entirely in the set.

87
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,916
This set, here the [UNKNOWN] table set
here that's non convex, and

88
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,546
to show that is non convex here's a point
in the set, here's a point in the set, and

89
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:11,021
the line segment between them is drawn
right here, and

90
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,486
you can see that it doesn't lie entirely
in the set, or another way to say it is

91
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:22,220
that there's not a clear line of sight in
the set, from this point to this point.

92
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,325
This set here it's almost convex but it's
not convex and it's not convex because,

93
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,680
for example, here's a point in the set and
here's a point in the set, and if I

94
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,420
draw the segment between them it crosses
over that area where the boundary was not

95
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,350
contained in the set and so it's not It
doesn't contain the entire segement.

96
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,822
So that's a non convex set.

97
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:48,830
Okay, now you have the idea of a convex
combination.

98
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,006
So a convex combination,

99
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,680
now generalizes the idea we just looked at
of a line segment.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,580
It's basically this.

101
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,440
It says I have K points now where I use to
have 2.

102
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,004
And if I form a linear combination of the
case in points with coefficients data 1

103
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:04,570
up to data k.

104
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,890
If they don't want to data, up to data k
or

105
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,390
just any real numbers, that's a linear
combination.

106
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,242
However to make it a convex combination,
these things have to add up to 1 and

107
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,570
they have to be non-negative, so.

108
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,650
In the case when K is two,

109
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,850
it's exactly the same as the previ-, it
defines a line segment, right.

110
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,200
So a convex combination is any element on
a line segment between two points, okay?

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,990
So this is the conv-, convex combination.

112
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,726
And you can think of it many ways, I'd
like to think of the thetas as

113
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:35,370
mixture coefficients and you can think of
x as a mixture.

114
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,750
So it says take 10% of x1, 0% of x2, and
so on and up, you know and 12% of xk and

115
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:47,849
all of these percentages have to add up to
1, okay, that's the convex combination.

116
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,819
People use the word mixture but that's not
a standard mathematical term, alright, so

117
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,651
people just use they arm convex
combination...

118
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:03,550
now, the convex hull and the a con of a
set.

119
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,630
That is the set of all convex combiations
of poitns in a set so,

120
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,090
if the original set were this finite set.

121
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,960
These dark points.

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,870
That's a finite set.

123
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,755
Then the convex hull of it is this shaded
region.

124
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,330
Gear.

125
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,682
And for example, if you take a point here
you can get that well that that might be

126
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:26,560
a convex combination of 2 of them right?

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,592
If I take a point in there it might be a
convex combination certainly of these 3

128
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:34,435
but probably of others it's a convex
combation of this one and this one and

129
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:37,062
this one.

130
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:38,089
Right?

131
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:43,120
So there's no reason to believe that that
convex combination is going to be unique.

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,250
In general it's not.

133
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,556
It's just a point is in the convex hull if
it is a convex combination of

134
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:49,880
some points in the set.

135
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,270
Now visually you can think of a convex
hull as simply something like

136
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,913
the smallest convex hull that contains the
original set, so for example our kidney or

137
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,850
[UNKNOWN] table shape here, the convex
hull is this headed region, and so

138
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,870
we have included all of the points in
here...

139
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,302
Which previously were not in the original
set, but they are n the convex hull and

140
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,900
now this shaded region is convex.

141
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,365
So that's the idea of convex hull.

142
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:23,417
Okay, convex cone, that is simply we start
with the idea of iconic combination and

143
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:29,130
another name for that is a negative
combination.

144
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,514
So I take a linear combination of two
points.

145
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,480
That is theta 1 plus theta 2.

146
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,830
Now if they're, theta 1 and theta 2 are
general it's just a linear combination.

147
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,510
If the add a,

148
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,970
if they're non-negative and add up to 1
that is called a convex combination.

149
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,008
And here the requirement for a conic
combination is simply that theta 1 and

150
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,990
theta 2 are non-negative.

151
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,075
Alright, so that, that's the definition of
a conic combination.

152
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:57,960
Some people do say that's an non-negative
combination of x1 and x2, okay?

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,559
Now geometrically the picture is this,
here's x1 and here's x2 and here's 0,

154
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,900
then conic combinations is this sort of
pie slice that goes between x1, x2 and 0.

155
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,054
It sits in a plane, even if x1 and x2 are
in a high dimensional space The set of

156
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:19,904
conic combinations lies in a plane that
passes through zero, x1, x2.

157
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:22,742
And then for example these points on this
boundary,

158
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:28,200
these are all the points that are
multiples, nonnegative multiples of x1.

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,198
These are all the points that are
nonnegative multiples of x1.

160
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:35,476
x2, and now all these points for example,
if I take something right smack in

161
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:42,010
the middle, these are the points that are
non negative multiples of x1 plus x2.

162
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,561
Another way to say that is that's
everything of the form theta x1

163
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,780
plus theta x2, okay?

164
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,670
But general, it sweeps out this whole set
like that.

165
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,120
And a convex cone is this: It's a set that
contains the conic,

166
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,110
all conic combinations of any two points
in the set paired.

167
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,190
So if you have two points in the set, the
entire conic, all conic con,

168
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,705
combinations, are in the set.

169
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,785
So that's a, that's a convex cone.

170
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:10,885
What we're going to do now is look at some
sets that we

171
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:15,910
will see throughout the entire course.

172
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,927
Right.
So these are sets like,

173
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:19,292
you know, solution sets of linear
equalities and other things and

174
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,450
we are going to see these basically
throughout the course.

175
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,770
Right now and in fact for

176
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,880
the rest of this lecture things are
going to be a little bit.

177
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,323
Dry because it's just the mat.

178
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:33,129
But I can assure you that we will use all
of this later and

179
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:37,260
it'll make a lot more sense in a practical
context.

180
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,270
But for now everything is just abstract.

181
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,350
And that's just too bad.

182
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,850
That's, that's the way the course starts.

183
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,579
So, okay, so let's look at hyperplanes and
halfspaces.

184
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,699
A hyperplane Is a solution set of a single
linear inequality constrain write

185
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:54,114
a single linear eq, equation.

186
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:58,144
Okay, and we will take a0 is equal to 0
right because of a otherwise this thing is

187
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,557
silly if it is 0.

188
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:05,980
So that's that's a hyper plane and it
would be for example its a line.

189
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,284
Right?
Say solution set of

190
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:10,950
a single linear equation in two variables
is just a line.

191
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,070
In three variables it's a plane, and
that's, and

192
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,826
in more variables I guess that's why it's
called a hyperplane,

193
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:19,910
because it's like a plane but it's in
higher dimensions.

194
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,160
So it's a hyperplane.

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,830
And a is a normal to that hyperplane.

196
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,350
So Here if this is, of course this is just
a line.

197
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,560
But a is the normal to that.

198
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,584
And these are this set, that's the set of
all points that satisfy a x equals b.

199
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:34,544
When you vary b what happens is this, this
thing moves up and down like that.

200
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:41,072
These are, these are parallel planes,

201
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:46,055
that depends on b.

202
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:51,247
So, solution set of a single linear
inequalities is a hyperplane.

203
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,630
A halfspace is this.

204
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,420
It's a set, It's the solution set of a
single linear inequality.

205
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,548
So here I say that a transposed x is less
than or

206
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,600
equal to b as opposed to being equal to b.

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,830
If it's equal to b it would be this line
right here.

208
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,491
This might be, well, b minus .01 and this
would be b minus 0.2 and so on, so

209
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:16,769
everything in this half space, these are
all the points where a transpose x

210
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,047
is less than the value of b, and if you
change b you simply move the surface of

211
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:28,075
this in a parallel way, you move it up and
down...

212
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:33,670
Okay and now A is an outward normal to
that set.

213
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,980
Okay, so A is a normal vector in this case
it's actual an outward normal.

214
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,259
Now these sets are both affine and convex
and

215
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,610
half spaces are not affine but they are
convex.

216
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,739
I should say hyper planes are affine and
convex.

217
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,211
Half spaces are convex and they're not
affline.

218
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:57,859
Now this has to be shown you can look at
it and you can verify it visually and

219
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:02,800
by intutition but these are things that
you'd, you'd have to show.

220
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,448
It's not particularly hard to show these
things but you have to.

221
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,750
So let's take a look for example.

222
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,490
A halfspace.

223
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,040
The question that we have to ask is this.

224
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,850
If I take two points in a halfspace, the
question is whether the segment is in it?

225
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,832
And we'll just say well geometrically it's
obvious.

226
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:25,680
And if you like, we can do this
algebraically.

227
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,624
To show this algebraically, we would say
suppose that a transpose x1,

228
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:35,010
it less than b, or less or equal to b, and
a transpose x2.

229
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,783
Is less than b.

230
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:40,920
That means x1 and x2 are in the half
space.

231
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,376
And now let's take a convex combination,
Data x1 plus 1 minus data x2 and

232
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,940
let's call that x.

233
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,868
And, and the question then is whether a
transpose x is less than b and

234
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,630
the hope is yes.

235
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,462
And if that's true then because x1 and x2
are arbitrary and

236
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:05,915
data was arbitrary between 0 and 1, I
didn't say that actually but I am now.

237
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:12,531
If we verify this then we'll have verified
a half space is, is a convex set.

238
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:14,910
Well a transpose x.

239
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:22,911
Is nothing but A transpose theta X1 plus 1
minus theta X2 and sure enough this

240
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:32,680
is theta 1 H a transpose X1 plus minus
theta A transpose X2.

241
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,130
Now, that's non negative non negative so
that's less than or

242
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,225
equal to theta 1 B plus 1 minus.

243
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,508
>> One minus theta times b, I'm using the
following fact here,

244
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:47,990
this number is less than that number,
that's our assumption.

245
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,650
This number is less than that number,
that's our assumption.

246
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,960
And finally, we get this, and that's of
course equal to b, and we're done.

247
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,802
Okay, so I will never do a derivative this
simple again in this course,

248
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:03,750
this is just to show you the kind of
argument you'd have to make.

249
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,014
Did you, I mean you draw a picture and
your eyeball says yes that's convex, but

250
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:10,583
these things actually have to get changed,
okay.

251
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,828
The next thing we're going to look at...

252
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:18,220
are euclidean balls and ellipsoids.

253
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,946
So, a Euclidean ball, Euclidean refers to
the fact that we're going to

254
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:24,780
use the two norm here, so the square root
of the sum of the squares.

255
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,540
A two norm, Euclidean ball looks like
this.

256
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,278
It's the set of X for which the distance
to X C,

257
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:37,469
that's the center of the ball, is less
than r, r is the radius of the ball.

258
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,556
So that's, that's what you mean by a ball.

259
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:43,372
It looks like this right, it's the cell
thing here there's x c and

260
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,917
the radius is r, that's a ball.

261
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,953
Now this can also be written in a free
parameter or

262
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:54,890
I should say a constrained parameter
representation.

263
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,470
Right.

264
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,520
This is the style where you say it's the
set of X for

265
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,850
which a certain perdicate evaluates to
true.

266
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,275
The predicate is this inequality.

267
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:05,390
Here, it's a mixed things.

268
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,840
It says it's the set of all points of the
form the center plus R

269
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,090
times U where U is a vector of norm less
than or equal to 1.

270
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,570
You have to of course show that this is
the case but it's not hard.

271
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,190
And these are, this is convex but again
I'm not going to show it but it's true.

272
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,310
A generalization is an ellipsoid.

273
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,820
So, an ellipsoid is a set.

274
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,260
The set of points to satisfy a quadratic
inequality.

275
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,480
Here c is the center.

276
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,310
And p is a positive definite, symmetric
positive matrix, right?

277
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,000
So, this is an ellipsoid.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,438
And here, for example.

279
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:45,511
The semiaxes of the ellipsoid are given by
the eigenvectors of p,

280
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:50,040
and the semiaxis lengths are related.

281
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,295
In fact, the square roots of the
eigenvalues of p,

282
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,222
these are the lengths of the semiaxes.

283
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,702
And there is a corresponding There's
definintly a corressponding representation

284
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,410
just like this.

285
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,233
Op I should mention the following if you
take P to be R squared if I

286
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,075
take P equal R squared I.

287
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,819
Then, in fact, this will give you, that's
an ellipsoid but

288
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,020
it's also a euclidean ball so this is a
generalization.

289
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,910
The generalization of this representation
for

290
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:32,050
a ball is this one it says it's the set of
Xc plus Au where norm U is less than 1.

291
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,970
So you could even say something like this.

292
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,890
It's the set of all things of the form Xc
plus a matrix A times U where U

293
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,325
is in the unit.

294
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,670
Ball, right.

295
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,274
So it's a linear transformation of the
uni-bulb plus an offset,

296
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,840
which is the center, okay.

297
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,222
So that's the a, that, that is a
representation.

298
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:56,010
By the way, this representation here, is
unique, in other words,

299
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,720
if this is equal to another set with a
different.

300
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,800
With another p.

301
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,528
Those two matrices have to be equal and

302
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,680
I'm assuming that they're symmetric, here,
right?

303
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,916
If they're not symmetric that's false.

304
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,580
But if they're, if they're symmetric which
you can assume without loss of generality,

305
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,159
then it's true.

306
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:20,633
Here the A in this representation is not
unique.

307
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,609
A is, A there's multiple A's here that
would give you the same Set

308
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,017
in particular if I take A and I multiply
it on the right by Q,

309
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:32,860
here where Q is an orthogonal matrix.

310
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,436
So Q trans, Q is square and satisfies
that.

311
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:42,070
Then for sure AQ can be substituted for A
here and you get the same set.

312
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,975
And the reason is actually quite simple.

313
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,780
The reason is if I take a something whose
norm is less than 1 and

314
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,355
I multiple it by an orthongonal vector I
get something whose norm is less than 1

315
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:56,068
and in fact it goes vice versa so that's
why it's the same thing.

316
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,252
I'll just mention the following we can
make this representation unique here

317
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:05,070
by insisting that A B.

318
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,409
A symmetric and positive definite, so that
makes it unique, and I'll let you

319
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,748
figure out how that would be, how, well
how you would make that argument, but

320
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:16,630
the hint would be to take a singular value
decomposition of a.

321
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:25,985
Okay the next in our tour of some of these
very basic sets that are convex...

322
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,640
Is, we'll look at a more general norm.

323
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,805
So if we have a, a norm, and a norm is
nothing but a function.

324
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,797
And it's usually written with instead of
as a,

325
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:40,290
as a normal function notation like this.

326
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,767
It's usually written with it's argument
surrounded By double bars,

327
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,150
that's the standard notation.

328
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,111
The double bar, by the way, is supposed to
make it look like an absolute value

329
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,884
because a norm is something like, it's
supposed to serve the purpose of

330
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,420
an absolute value, but in multiple
dimensions.

331
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,630
That's what a norm is supposed to be.

332
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,438
Here are, here are the requirements that
should be, that for, for

333
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,370
a function to be a norm.

334
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,010
One is it always has to be non negative.

335
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,355
It's supposed to measure the length of a
vector.

336
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:09,931
So, negative doesn't make any sense and it
should be 0 if and

337
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,920
only if the vector is 0, right?

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,140
And that, I think that's called
definiteness.

339
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,650
So, these two together is called positive
definiteness.

340
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,680
It's a function that is 0, only if the
argument is 0.

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,430
In other word, it's always non negative.

342
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,210
Okay, it has to be homogeneous of degree
1, that is if you scale.

343
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,420
X by a scale factor t.

344
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,390
Then that's the same as the norm of x
times the absolute value of t,

345
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,180
and that would work with negative.

346
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,600
So for example the norm of x is the norm
of minus x.

347
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,500
And finally, you have the so called
triangle inequality.

348
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,083
And that says that the norm of x plus y is
less than the norm of x plus the norm of

349
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,400
y, right.

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,270
So and, it basically it's called the
triangle inequality.

351
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,490
Roughly because well we'll get it to but
it says something like this.

352
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,138
If you have a point x here and you have a
point y over here then x plus y is

353
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:03,170
over here and it says that this distance
here is less than this distance plus

354
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,010
this distance, which is the same as this
distance plus this distance, so

355
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,910
at least for the euclidean norm...

356
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,970
Where we all of a lot of intuition this
says basically,

357
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,118
that in a triangle the longest side is
certainly not longer than the sum of

358
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:24,900
the lengths of the two shorter sides,
okay?

359
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,030
Now the notation is when you right just
the norm it's a general unspecific norm.

360
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,120
And usually what that means is the
ascertion you're going to make.

361
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,480
It's true for any norm, right?

362
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,495
Now when we're talking about a particular
norm, usually there'll be a numonic or

363
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:43,670
a symbol down below that tells you the
particular norm.

364
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,820
I mean we've already seen one,

365
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,966
we've seen the two norm that's the
Eucidian norm, that's the that's this.

366
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:56,510
So, we've seen that, but there's lots of
others okay?

367
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,526
Now from a norm this is supposed to be
review,

368
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,720
now from a norm there's some very
interesting sets you can come up with.

369
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,775
One is a norm ball, that's the set of all
points which are,

370
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:12,840
have a distance, as measured by the norm,
less than r, from some center.

371
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,875
And that's a norm ball with radius R.

372
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,967
Here, norm cone, that's something much
more interesting we'll see a lot of

373
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,248
this in the class as we move on.

374
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:27,912
The norm cone is a, is a set that sits in
the graph space, right, so

375
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:32,211
the graph space of something.

376
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:37,990
Is the set of all pairs that, that's a,
that's in say RN.

377
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,643
And T is in R alright, so

378
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:47,460
if you were to plot graph of a function
that would be the set of all x and f of x.

379
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,791
for example, alright something like that
so

380
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:53,930
x is in Rn, alright that would be the
graph of a function.

381
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,370
Its a set of all things were x,

382
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,676
you think of x is being down here and then
the height is what gives you f of x.

383
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:02,012
'Kay?

384
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:05,650
So, here this is not the graph.

385
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,880
It's actually what's called the epigraph
of the norm.

386
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,010
Which we'll talk about later.

387
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,660
But now it looks like that.

388
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,910
And what it is, is the differences is in
inequality here.

389
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,680
And it says, it's not just.

390
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,070
So in fact, in this picture here, this
should all be filled in.

391
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,120
That's a solid cone.

392
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,500
It's a solid cone.

393
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,190
I, I'm drawing the sort of a boundary.

394
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,960
But in fact, you should think of a solid
cone that goes up like that.

395
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,300
And people would call this a circular
cone,

396
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,392
that's if the norm is the Euclidean norm
That's a circular cone, okay?

397
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:36,165
And if you take a Euclidean norm cone,
that's drawn here,

398
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:41,440
that's called a second order cone and
we're going to be seeing a lot of it..

399
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,009
Oh, main assertion, norm balls and cones
are convex.

400
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:49,810
So by the way, the norm cone, as the name
implies Is a convex cone.

401
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,467
So by the way you can't just say that, I
mean you know technically somebody has to

402
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:57,177
show these things well that could be you
on your homework or something like that,

403
00:23:57,177 --> 00:24:01,311
but will that's something we'll well you
can either what you can either trust us

404
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:08,080
read about it or some of these things are
very good exercise yourself.

405
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,720
This is sit down and

406
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,050
show that some of these things hold, by
the way some of these might are.

407
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,590
are trickier than you think.

408
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,190
Showing something like this, the triangle
inequality.

409
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,009
It's not so bad for Euclidean, but for
others it need not be that easy,

410
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:27,910
ahead of time or if you haven't seen the
proof in awhile.

411
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:36,750
Okay, this brings us to a polyhedron,
another name for this is polytopes.

412
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,547
I'll say a little bit under that minute.

413
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:42,187
And that's defined as a solution set of
finitely many linear inequalities and

414
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:44,060
equalities, right?

415
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:52,090
So if you have a set of linear equations
and a set of linear inequalities, right?

416
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,870
Oh, and here, this symbol means
componentwise inequality.

417
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,000
Right so, not everyone uses a different
symbol, right?

418
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,360
So a lot of people just write that this
way.

419
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,898
Because there's not that many different
definitions of what it means for

420
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:10,140
one vector to be less than another, right?

421
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,350
So, but we'll write it with a swiggly
thing.

422
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,120
And that means that every entry of this
vector is less than the corresponding

423
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,050
entry of that vector.

424
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:25,610
And of course what that means is each row
of Ax is less than or equal to B.

425
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:33,110
Each row defines a single hyperplane and
so it would look like this here is A1.

426
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,890
Here is the boundary of it.

427
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,846
The first row of this is all points, kind
of over here.

428
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:40,568
Okay?

429
00:25:40,568 --> 00:25:43,820
It's that halfspace.

430
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,980
That's all points that are over here.

431
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,956
And the second row of this inequality,

432
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:54,200
that gives you all the points that are
over here.

433
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,324
And of course if you take the
intersection,

434
00:25:56,324 --> 00:26:00,748
what you end up with is this shaded set,
something like that Okay.

435
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:04,004
So, that's the, that this is defined to be
a, a, a po, a,

436
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:08,660
a polyhedron and the plural is polyhedra,
right.

437
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,644
And another name for this is polytope, is
that a name.

438
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:17,860
And, so, and then what gets even more
bizarre, is some people refer.

439
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,676
Distinguish between a polytope and a
polyhedron by,

440
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:23,880
using one to refer to the bounded version.

441
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,353
So if it's a bounded polyhedron it's
called a polytope and then believe it or

442
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:34,240
not, you can find another author who
exactly switches these, right?

443
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,865
So, for example, the general is a polytope
and a bounded one is a polyhedron.

444
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:42,645
So your best bet is just to stick with one
and either put bounded or

445
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:46,670
not in the front as a qualifier, so okay.

446
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,040
Alright so that's a polyhedron.

447
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,155
Another set that we're going to see a
whole lot is positive semi definite cone.

448
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,535
And the notation is this.

449
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,150
SN...

450
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,950
Is going to be, that's the set of
symmetric end by end matrices, right?

451
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,230
So that is that's a, a vector space,
right?

452
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,790
Because it's closed under linear
combinations and things like that.

453
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,070
Oh by the way, what's its dimension?

454
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,806
It's like n n plus 1 over 2.

455
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,542
because, well, I mean you could just
numerate a basis or whatever, or

456
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,558
you could just build very roughly
speaking, yeah,

457
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:20,774
it's how many numbers you need to describe
and general element and the answer is,

458
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:23,894
you describe the diagonal and the upper
triangle and you're done right, and so

459
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:29,196
that's n and plus one over two elements,
okay?

460
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:33,414
If you put a plus at the bottom that's the
set of positives positive semi definite n

461
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:37,176
by n matrices and that's the set of, that
what that means of course is that this is

462
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:40,197
the following issues quadratic form, its
just a z transpose Xz,

463
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:46,110
its bigger than equal to 0 for any z you
pick.

464
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,278
Right, so that's what that means.

465
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,582
And that's a convex cone, and what that
means is if you take two positive

466
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:54,222
semidefinite matrices, if you, if you take
a non negative linear combination,

467
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:59,961
then you get a non neg, you get another
positive semidefinite matrices.

468
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,687
Where it says, see these are covariances
if, if you like, if you like to

469
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:06,799
think statistically or something like
that, they're covariance matrices.

470
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,541
If you put plus, plus it, its something
like positive and that's the set of

471
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,703
positive definite ones right, so these are
I guess called co-variances of

472
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:20,920
random variables that are non-degenerator
I think there is some name for it.

473
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,958
But basically what that means is the
covariance matrix is,

474
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:27,436
the co- variance matrix is positive
definite.

475
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:33,193
And here's an example, here is the
positive semidefinite cone that,

476
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:37,215
in, in here is s plus two.

477
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,380
And it's got a dimension three, right,
described by x, y and z.

478
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,698
>> And here it is plotted, I mean you
can't see it,

479
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:47,358
actually This should look kind of, I've
had people describe all sorts of

480
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:52,490
things like the front of a ship or
something like that.

481
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,280
But you know what it really is, it's the
same as that cone.

483
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,040
It's the same as an orange cone it's just
rotating.

484
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,510
That's not hard to show.

485
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,091
I mean just write out what it means for

486
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:04,900
a 2x2 matrix to be positive, to be
definite that's what it means.

487
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,560
To determine it's positive.

488
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,392
I won't do that but I'm just saying that's
what this is.

489
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:14,243
Okay, so one of things that you are
going to need to do as practical matter is

490
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:18,786
this we will talk about convex functions
you know like may be next well,

491
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:23,329
definitely next week but one of the things
you are going to have to do is

492
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:31,196
to be able to determine whether a set is
convex or not.

493
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:35,579
That, that's going to be one of the things
you will absolutely need to know.

494
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:40,717
and, here's this, not that many ways you
can do this.

495
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,714
But the basic one is this.

496
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,462
And this is sort of you know, when you're
starting off or

497
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:47,300
something like this and sometimes it's the
right thing to do.

498
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,630
But actually quite, rather rarely, it's
this.

499
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,420
Is basically you just go, you go right
back to the basic definition.

500
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,772
And it says to show that it says convex,
here's what you do,

501
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,732
you say give me one element, give me
another one,

502
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:00,868
they're arbitrary, give me a number Theta
between 0 and 1 and then verify that

503
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:06,340
the convex combinations theta x1 plus 1
minus theta x2 is in the set.

504
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,580
That's, that's your, you can always fall
back on that.

505
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,460
But more interesting, and

506
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,970
something that's going to fit with a lot
of other things in the course...

507
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,070
And other stuff that we're going to do is
actually to come up with a an interesting,

508
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,870
is actually to use a calculus of convex
sets.

509
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,110
That's actually a more interesting.

510
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,510
It's constructive.

511
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,128
It's also going to to fit in with a sort
of a more modern computer sciency type

512
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,090
view of all this.

513
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,896
And if you actually wanted to do any of
these things,

514
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,270
this is going to be much more useful.

515
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,558
What I might add is that you will be doing
this and so it will be useful for you so

516
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:47,970
the idea there is that you have a calculus
yo have a bunch of atoms right?

517
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:55,350
You have a basic sets that are basic
solutions of linear equality.

518
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:04,125
By the way somebody.

519
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:09,050
It has to show at some point these verify
their properties right.

520
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,190
You do that.

521
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,420
And then the key is this.

522
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,210
You use operations that persever
convexity.

523
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,616
And then you build up a,

524
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:22,420
you generate new convex sets from your
atoms and these operations right.

525
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,800
And in fact if you like to think this way
it's a very good way to think.

526
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,155
It says, that what it means is that we'll
be messing around with

527
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:34,630
sets that are described generally by
expression trees.

528
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,390
They'll be an expression tree.

529
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,130
They'll be your set, and you'll go down
the expression tree.

530
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,070
The leaves will be atoms.

531
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,210
They'll be things.

532
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,180
Known that can change too right?

533
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,080
I mean, you, but it will basically these
will be things known to be convex.

534
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,490
And then at every note in the tree there
will be some operation that

535
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,650
preserves convexity.

536
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,520
Everybody following this?

537
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,495
So, or if you like to think of it, I mean
it's like a calculus.

538
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:01,740
Okay, and we're going to look, we'll look
at some of these things.

539
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,554
Some of these are kind of obvious, some
are not, and

540
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:08,775
we are going to hit some ones that are not
obvious today, so at least then you can

541
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:15,410
say in a first lecture it is not true that
you didn't hear anything.

542
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,135
It's not true that you didn't learn
anything.

543
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,879
Okay, alright so the first one is
intersection, right, so

544
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:24,935
intersection of any number, finite number,
infinite number,

545
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:30,390
uncountable number of convex sets is
convex, right?

546
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,070
By the way these things need to be shown.

547
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,919
That's a two liner or something like that.

548
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,650
I'm not going to do it.

549
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,858
I would recommend that you sit down and
you know show some of these.

550
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,636
So let's look at an example...

551
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:44,424
Here it is, S is going to be the set of
vectors in Rm for which this polynomial p

552
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:50,840
of t, which is going to depend on x, we'll
get that in a second.

553
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,405
Now, this polynomial p of t is less than
one for the, for

554
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:58,330
t absolute value less than or higher than
number 3, the p is this.

555
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,694
It's this it is a trig is so-called
trigonometric polynomial,

556
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:05,830
partial Fourier series, whatever you
want to call it, okay?

557
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,400
So there it is.

558
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,520
That's that's what this is, right?

559
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,796
Some periodic function with I guess up to
m, you know m, m plus 1,

560
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:16,626
you know Fourier coefficients or something
like that, right?

561
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:17,805
There it is.

562
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:19,600
So.
That's it.

563
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,883
In other words I'm going to identify with
each vector in RM,

564
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:26,386
well, a trigonometric polynomial, right.

565
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,550
That's it.

566
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,170
I didn't put constants in here but who
cares so okay.

567
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,450
So that, that's it.

568
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,920
And what this says is it is...

569
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,988
The set of all coeffi-, points in
coefficient space,

570
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:39,640
because that's really what R superscript m
is now.

571
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,670
It's the point of coefficient space where
the corresponding polynomial,

572
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,985
if you plotted it here that between, I
mean, 0 and pi over 3,

573
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:50,700
it's between negative 1 and 1.

574
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,290
That's the picture.

575
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:51,992
Everybody got it?

576
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:55,380
Okay, now you might ask a question like
this.

577
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,845
You might want to actually because of your
training you might want to right,

578
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:02,090
if you have this 19th century mathematics
training otherwise known as

579
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,109
the training we now give all our students.

580
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:09,130
But if you are trained in that you'll have
this urge to look at this and

581
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,610
try to write out some secret.

582
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,140
Lets work out what is S, lets write down
some formulas for S.

583
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,562
Right, let's, let's try to figure it out
OK, well and you can do that for

584
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:20,904
m equals to 1, 2, 3.

585
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,876
By the way, abou-, about m equals 5,

586
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:26,840
its impossible, there is no formula for it
right.

587
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,690
That, that it I mean, that that comes from
Gauss's theorem about polynomials and

588
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,510
things like that.

589
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,816
So, so this, basically there is no formula
for this for m equals 10,

590
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:38,245
there is no formula for it.

591
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,069
There is no way to write down this is true
if and

592
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,991
only if x satisfies the following things,
right.

593
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:49,836
Okay so, that's not quite true, I, I
misspoke there, it doesn't matter.

594
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:53,625
So it, anyway, its fantastically
complicated okay?

595
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,675
So.

596
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,691
Alright so and so first lets check of its
convex and

597
00:34:56,691 --> 00:35:01,020
the first thing is to just make sure that
on an intuitive level we all agree.

598
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,384
So what we are, what we are saying
inconvexity is something like this,

599
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:07,632
what we are saying is that if you have two
points lets call it x and

600
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:12,790
y is correspond to polynomials lets say p
and q.

601
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,857
And so what we're saying and by the way
you don't have to check for

602
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,620
theta, all theta's between 0.

603
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,340
And what it's good enough to show for
theta equals a half.

604
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,910
If you can show it for theta equals a half
you got it right.

605
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,890
So that's with I mean you don't need about
a set to say the following.

606
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,000
So say it's convex if and only if.

607
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,756
It's closed under averaging, averaging two
points nothing more, okay?

608
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:39,170
You do, you do need a little bit more but
that's getting into weird analyses, okay?

609
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,870
So, but let's see what that's saying.

610
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,680
It's saying that if I have two
polynomials, here's one, right?

611
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,957
And here's another one.

612
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,900
Let's see, here's, here's another one.

613
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,720
And there both in that set because on the
region 0 pi over 3 you're value is

614
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,707
between you know plus and

615
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,950
minus 1 and now we form the average of the
coefficients but when you form the average

616
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:02,070
of the coeffients you're actually forming
the average of the polynomial.

617
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,566
And the average of the polynomial indeed
is between minus 1 and

618
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:07,588
1 on that little interval and so it's in
the set.

619
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:08,712
Everybody got that?

620
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:13,083
That says this set s, is convex.

621
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,001
And when m equals 10 or

622
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:18,150
something like that it means we don't have
a very good way to describe s.

623
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,070
We don't, there's not an explicit way to
say this is what it means to be an s.

624
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,010
I mean there is one but we'll see it later
in the class right.

625
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,910
It's really complicated.

626
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,650
Right.

627
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,578
So, so the idea is it can be easy to
verify convexity even if

628
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:35,350
you don't have a simple discription of the
set.

629
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,550
That's actually a very important thing to
know.

630
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,870
Right because it, in fact that's going to
be fantastically useful.

631
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,040
That, this idea, okay.

632
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,938
So here's, heres a super quick proof of
it.

633
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,070
It's really simple.

634
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,864
It goes like this.

635
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:55,980
What I do is I'm going to introduce s sub
t.

636
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,696
And that's going to be the set of x n r m.

637
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:06,640
For which pft is less than one, okay.

638
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,666
So that's, that's St, yeah, notice it,
it's just a single point, that's a,

639
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:17,020
and I want you to tell me, so that's,
that's for each T, I get this set.

640
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,990
I want you to tell me, what is that set,
what does it look like.

641
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,280
It's an intersection of 2 half spaces
right.

642
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,159
Because this P of T is a linear function
of X's right?

643
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:28,771
It's just,

644
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:34,170
it's actually just the inner product of
cosine T cosine 2 T that vector of X.

645
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,410
So it's a linear function.

646
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,855
That says a linear lye's between 1 and
minus 1.

647
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,400
Linear fucntion less than 1 that's a half
space.

648
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,054
A linear function bigger than minus 1
that's a half space actually oriented

649
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,730
the other way and what it says is that is
a slab.

650
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,900
That is the correct term for that.

651
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,240
It's a slab.

652
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,410
It's the intersection of 2 parallel half
spaces with opposite orientation.

653
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,890
Okay, that's a slab.

654
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,850
And what that says is I can write s this
way.

655
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:06,649
S is the intersection over an uncountable
number, you know?

656
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:10,642
But you know, you know not to get bent out
of shape over that, it's this.

657
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:14,119
Right, so it's, it's that, it's the
intersection of those slabs, and

658
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,206
here is the picture, so here is s, and you
can see it, it's got some curvature if you

659
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:22,232
look in there, and what these lines show
is for each, for sets of some values of t,

660
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:28,455
maybe 20 values or t or 10 or something
like that...

661
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:32,870
What we've done is we've actually just
plotted the 2 slides now when the slab.

662
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:39,785
When T ranges between 0 and pi over 3 that
slab it rotates and it width changes.

663
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:40,417
Right.

664
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:44,066
And it says if you take an intersection
over all of

665
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:48,395
the slabs the inside is what's left.

666
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:52,200
That's gives you the set S okay.

667
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,826
So that's alright so just that's the idea.

668
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:56,647
Okay.

669
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:59,380
We'll look a couple more of these
operations.

670
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,050
Affine function.

671
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,210
So an affine fucntion is linear plus an
offset.

672
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,542
Alright, hmm and by the way some people
call this linear but

673
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,570
I hope only in informal context.

674
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,090
If you are with people you know very well
on stuff like that, you can,

675
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,870
you can do this right in [INAUDIBLE] but
its not linear its affine OK.

676
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,134
So it turns out that affine mappings they
preserve convexity both,

677
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:28,600
in both directions for mapping and
reverse.

678
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,844
And here again this is a standard
mathematical notation, but

679
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:33,010
it is something we should go over.

680
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,805
If I have a function then I can overload
that function to take as

681
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:41,730
argument as set and what it means here is
the following.

682
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,882
Its says its so

683
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:51,200
here f of S is the set of all things of
the form f of x where x is in S, right.

684
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,320
So that's, that's absolutely universal
standard notation to

685
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,530
overload a function to root.

686
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,339
So I could talk about a function and I
could say what is the, what,

687
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:04,110
I could ask about what is the function of
say a unit ball or a polyhedron.

688
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,842
And the answer is some set.

689
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,995
It's the, all the values or something.

690
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:09,080
Right?

691
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,345
Now the inverse image is also is, is also
absolutely standard notation and

692
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:18,180
it is not maybe what you'd think.

693
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,731
Okay, so there's two ways to parse that,
and I'll, I'll explain what they are,

694
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:23,687
to interpret it.

695
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,581
So one way is to simply take the inverse
function, F inverse, and, and is, and

696
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:31,430
say that it's a f, it's something of this
form.

697
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,900
So you take this inverse function and then
it's the same as that.

698
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,540
But, in fact, the inverse image of a set
under a function is

699
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,510
defined even when that function is not one
to one with, by the way,

700
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,220
there is the case, that function does not
have an inverse.

701
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,640
So this is defined, f inverse of c is
defined for a set.

702
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,020
Even in cases when f is not invertible, so

703
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,710
f inverse the function does not even
exist, f inverse the relation does.

704
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,020
Okay, so and it's simply defined this way.

705
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,400
It is the set of points that map into the
set, right?

706
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,422
So if that's your set C then you just
simply apply f and if you land in the set,

707
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:13,391
in fact let me have them land at the same
point, there you go,

708
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:19,770
then these two points are in f inverse of
c.

709
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,130
And notice that they both land, they both
have the same value of f and

710
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,280
therefore f is obviously not invertible.

711
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,430
Right but this f this notation does work.

712
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,678
And by the way, when the two contexts
agree they are consistent,

713
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:37,622
right that's required of notation, right,
that if you have ambiguous notation it

714
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:40,986
must be the case that when two contexts
overlap, that you get the same,

715
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:47,250
you assign the same semantics, right and
that, that's correct, okay.

716
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:53,150
So, so affine functions preserve convexity
Both forward and reverse.

717
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,090
So images and inverse images.

718
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,720
Okay?

719
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,850
And that's and again, you have to show
this.

720
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,880
But let's look at some examples.

721
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,150
Well, some are obvious, right?

722
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,520
If you scale a set.

723
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,325
If I multiply it by 2 or 3 or minus 5.

724
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:10,328
That, that, that's going to preserve
convexity.

725
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,420
If I translate it, if I move it here,
that's going to do.

726
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,550
I mean, another one of course is if I
rotate it and stuff like that.

727
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,520
If I project it.

728
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,927
If I take a set which is an R10 and

729
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:24,950
I simply look at the first five components
of it.

730
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,460
Right, so Or, well, let's, let's do an R3.

731
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,812
I take a three dimensional object and I'll
only look at X1,

732
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:33,311
X2 which is basically the same as waking
it's shadow, on that,

733
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,960
on that plane, then that's going to become
fixed.

734
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,690
That's kind of obvious, right, that the
shadow cast by a convex set in R3.

735
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,600
Is convex.

736
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,524
That's the convex set in R 2.

737
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay here's one, this is something we'll
see, you know,

738
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,848
fairly often, it's called a linear matrix
inequality, and so it says this,

739
00:42:55,848 --> 00:43:04,990
I have a bunch of matrices A1 through AM,
I form the sum of xi times ai, right?

740
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:09,870
And I say that's less than or equal to b,
where b is a matrix, a symmetric matrix.

741
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,710
This is in a matrix sense, right?

742
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,830
And the idea is this is supposed to look
like linear inequality.

743
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,020
Right?
Written out, right?

744
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,516
An ordinary, if the a's were lower case B
was a number and

745
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:24,700
that squiggly was an ordinary inequality.

746
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,519
Oh, by the way, if the two notations would
match up then it would be the same thing,

747
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:31,880
then that would be a half space.

748
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,615
But here it's the,

749
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:36,670
it's defined by matrix inequalities,
that's called a linear matrix inequality.

750
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,400
It's convex and the way you know this is
convex is the following.

751
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:49,460
I'm going to form a function, which is f
Its going to map rm into s sp.

752
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,880
And its going to be this, it's going to be
b minus sum xi, ai.

753
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,110
Okay, so that's, that's my function.

754
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,598
Its affine, that's an affine function and
its inverse image,

755
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:06,760
the inverse image of that function of the
positive semi-definite cone.

756
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,630
Is this set, is this linear matrix
inequality.

757
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,222
Right because what I'm saying is the set
of x's for [INAUDIBLE] this

758
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:21,750
thing here is positive semi definite
that's exactly this set here.

759
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,550
I mean you'd have to put something on the
other side but

760
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,151
its the same thing, right and so that,
that tells you that, that's it.

761
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:29,700
You'd have things like this.

762
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,080
The hyperbolic cone.

763
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,033
That's the set of points where x transpose
px, that's a quadratic form,

764
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:40,388
is less than some c transpose x squared
and c transpose x is bigger or equal to 0,

765
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:44,676
that's actually convex because it's the
inverse image of the standard cone,

766
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:47,624
the nor cone, two norm cone, under an fi
mapping and I,

767
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:55,076
I won't go into that but I'll let you look
into that...

768
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:55,642
Okay.

769
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:59,162
Now we're going to get to something that's
actually different, cause so far,

770
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:02,902
everything so far is kind of obvious and,
you know, two lines and stuff like to show

771
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:09,430
everything, now we're going to go up to
something that takes four, so, here it is.

772
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,170
The perspective function.

773
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,980
Is a function that maps, well let's say rn
plus 1.

774
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,960
I mean it could also map rn into rn minus
1.

775
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,932
But let's say it maps rn plus 1 into rn,
and

776
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:23,230
it's this: it's the perspective function
is p of x and t.

777
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,322
You simply divide the first n elements of
the vector by its last component,

778
00:45:27,322 --> 00:45:30,830
that's called the perspective function.

779
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,975
But it's also called projective I think
in, in,

780
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:36,101
in some areas right, called projective
mapping.

781
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:41,219
Okay, and the domain is the half space
where t is positive.

782
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:43,610
Okay?
So that's what it is.

783
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,746
And it's the effect of sort of normalizing
by the last component, or

784
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,650
something like that.

785
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,908
By the way, it comes up a whole lot more
than you think.

786
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:55,731
So, okay, so it turns out inverse images
forward And reverse and

787
00:45:55,731 --> 00:46:01,282
inverse images of convex sets under the
perspective mapping are convex,

788
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:06,798
and that is not obvious at all, okay.

789
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:08,150
It's true.

790
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,980
It's not hard to show.

791
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,920
Like I said instead of two lines it's
four, okay, but its not obvious, right, so

792
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,380
it says that if you have a, um...

793
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,180
If, if you have an operation that does
this,

794
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,630
it says that if I have a bunch of points
in the convex set, and

795
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,690
then I simply take the first chunk of the
vector divided by the last element.

796
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,900
That makes, that gives me a new set in in
one smaller dimension.

797
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,170
That's convex, okay?

798
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,235
And, it's, it's not obvious, it I don't
think.

799
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:39,893
So, and a generalization, it's not even a
generalization of it,

800
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:43,985
if you precompose the persecutive function
with an [UNKNOWN] function you get

801
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:49,990
something called a linear fractional
function, and that looks like this.

802
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,152
It's a function that's an [UNKNOWN]
divided by [UNKNOWN] and

803
00:46:53,152 --> 00:46:58,268
the denominator scaler, and the domain is
where the scaler is positive...

804
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,140
Right.
The denominator's positive.

805
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,580
So that, that's called a linear fractional
function.

806
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,719
And probably if you've taken a course on
vision, for

807
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,600
example, you would've seen these and maybe
some other things as well.

808
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,499
It comes up in other areas as well.

809
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,140
It's very basic in probability.

810
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,770
This is called conditioning.

811
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,947
Right.
You work out what you do

812
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:21,674
when you compute a conditional
distribution.

813
00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:23,746
That's what you are doing, you are taking
an,

814
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:28,800
an offline function in the numerator, and
then denominator, you are normalizing.

815
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,724
You are normalizing [UNKNOWN] by

816
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,620
the probability that said that that's
exactly this.

817
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:37,284
So, conditioning is also is like a linear
fractional function Okay.

818
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:40,962
And these these preserve convexity.

819
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:43,210
Okay.

820
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,210
So, a quick example, is something like
this,

821
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,985
here's one here's a mapping from R2 to R2,
and

822
00:47:48,985 --> 00:47:56,435
the domain is X1 plus X2 plus one is
positive, that's the domain of F, okay?

823
00:47:56,435 --> 00:48:01,334
And, so the domain is everything over here
this, that dash line says, you know,

824
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:05,350
that's, that's out of the domain.

825
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:05,931
Right?

826
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:08,455
So is the line, it's not in the domain
either.

827
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:09,595
And the image,

828
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:17,180
it says that the image of a convex set
under this mapping is is convex.

829
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:17,730
Right?
So.

830
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,565
But then it's kind of boring for me to
show that for example if I showed a circle

831
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,823
here it would be like ellipsoid over here,
so it's kind of boring to show.

832
00:48:24,823 --> 00:48:27,985
But just to give you a rough idea of what
it does, here's a non-convex set and

833
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:30,054
here's it's image.

834
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:32,322
And if you look at it carefully, you'll
realize it,

835
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:35,050
something about it looks very natural.

836
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,845
And then, then you'll understand and it's
a good, it says that,

837
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:42,916
it tell you why we are all intimately
familiar with perspective and

838
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:46,660
linear fractional mappings.

839
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,339
This is actually what this looks like on
your retina.

840
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:52,330
Here's, here's why.

841
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,809
Let's take this set here, and you fly,
let's fly above it, so

842
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,720
let's get, let's put it in 3D so it's
lying down and

843
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:05,670
you have that shape, whatever it is, c,
and let's fly above it...

844
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,308
Like this and

845
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:11,080
lets get may be like right you know here,
actually we would be like right here.

846
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,588
Let, lets be there but lets, lets go
couple of 100 meters in the air and

847
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:16,230
lets look down at it and what would you
see.

848
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,640
You would actually see exactly that, right
and this for shortening right,

849
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,830
cos the this is, these, these, these
correspond to like these things,

850
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:28,980
the things that are close to you right and
so they're, they are strecthed out.

851
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,340
And the stuff that's in the distance is
shrunk and that's, that's this, right?

852
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,240
And that would actually be sort of the
horizon.

853
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:35,810
That's that thing.

854
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,018
That's looking way off that's if you look
parallel,

855
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,300
you look way up to the horizon, okay?

856
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,430
So in fact, and if you've had a class on
vision or something like that

857
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,070
you would You, you would know this, that,
that actually what we

858
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:55,994
see all the time I mean the damage on your
retina is a linear fractional mapping.

859
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:59,114
Or for that matter the image on a camera
plane is

860
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:03,914
a linear fractional mapping of well,
neglecting optical aberrations,

861
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:11,333
is suppose to be a linear fractional
mapping of the 3D Object space.

862
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,160
Okay?
And so what this says is the following.

863
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:13,820
And it's kind of cool.

864
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,950
It says this.

865
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,648
It says that if you, if an object is
convex in 3-D, then it says that

866
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:27,950
the image it casts, it, it puts onto your
camera or your retina is, is convex.

867
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,730
Look at one more topic.

868
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,174
And that's generalized inequalities.

869
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:37,634
So, this is going to be very useful for
us, that is you generalize inequality,

870
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:42,086
r, to other contexts, and you have all
undoubtably seen this for

871
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:50,470
example in the context of matrix
inequality, so here it is...

872
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,656
If you have a convex cone in Rn it's
called proper if it satifies a couple

873
00:50:53,656 --> 00:50:55,130
of things.

874
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,707
First of all it's closed in other words
I'll draw one in R2 it

875
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:06,050
says it's gotta contain, it has to contain
it's boundary elemets okay so it's closed.

876
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,670
Oh the other things it's solid so it has
to have non empty interior right.

877
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,048
So for example this.

878
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:14,280
That's a cone.

879
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,187
A rate is a cone, right, so rate is just a
point that goes from 0,

880
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:21,470
goes off in some direction, that's a rate,
and it's a one.

881
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,950
But it is not solid, right.

882
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,435
I really like these terms, right, because
they are very evocative of what I mean, so

883
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:33,300
solid means it's not, it's not flat...

884
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,950
Or something like that.

885
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,850
It means there's a ball in it..

886
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:36,741
Okay.

887
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:37,960
And it's pointed.

888
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,140
Pointed says you don't, it doesn't contain
a line, right?

889
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,115
So for example, a line is a cone, right?

890
00:51:44,115 --> 00:51:47,571
A line is a cone, but there's something, I
mean, technically, it's a cone, and

891
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,359
that's just fine.

892
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,049
It's a cone.

893
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:53,073
But it's, there's something about it,
because the whole idea of cone for

894
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:55,719
us is supposed to mean, or it's supposed
to evoke The idea of

895
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:00,810
something that's asymmetric that it goes
one way but not the other.

896
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:01,314
Right, so

897
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:07,020
I mean well that is a cone, when it is not
a proper cone because it's not pointed.

898
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,010
So pointed means that it doesn't contain
any line.

899
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,664
[INAUDIBLE] it says, it says that in any
ray you can't have a ray and

900
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:17,990
it's negative both in the cone that's what
it says.

901
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,390
Okay, that's, that, that's what pointed
means.

902
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,432
So Here's some examples.

903
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,840
Nonnegative orthant, right?

904
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,680
That's the, that's the, that's the denoted
R plus to the end.

905
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,413
You know, it's a, the set in R2.

906
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:36,340
Positive semidefinite cone, that's
pointed.

907
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,160
Sorry, that's proper.

908
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,982
Of course, it's pointed.

909
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:41,820
Nonnegative polynomials.

910
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,390
So there you go.

911
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:48,170
The set of coefficients of polynomials
that are nonnegative on some interval.

912
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,025
That's a that's a proper cone.

913
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:52,730
Okay, it's a bit of an obscure one, but it
is one.

914
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,450
Okay, so these are proper cones.

915
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,468
Now when you have a proper cone, you can
make up an inequality out of it.

916
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,410
And the way you do that is really simple.

917
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,966
You simply say That x lesser than equal to
y with respect to the concave, that's how

918
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:10,388
you read this in English right and its
denoted x squiggly lesser than equal to y,

919
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:14,676
sub k as with respect to k and that simply
means y minus x is in the cone, right so

920
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:18,294
this idea of the cone, the cone is
supposed to define your what you

921
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:26,470
going to call your non negative elements.

922
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,958
So what we do is, armed with this idea of
a cone.

923
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:31,990
And the cone is going to be, roughly
speaking, our non-negative element.

924
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,690
Oh by the way, here's a really simple
cone, ready?

925
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,670
The set of non-negative numbers, okay?

926
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,036
And that's a proper cone.

927
00:53:38,036 --> 00:53:41,572
I mean it's kind of silly to take an
elementary idea and make it so

928
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:43,840
complicated, right?

929
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,560
kind of pedantic.

930
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,620
But anyway, that's, that's, that's what
these are supposed to be.

931
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,660
And so then, then you can define an
inequality.

932
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,288
An inequality is defined in the obvious
way,

933
00:53:51,288 --> 00:53:53,640
it says that one thing is less than
another.

934
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,310
Says that the difference is non negative.

935
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,710
And strict inequality means you're in the
interior of the cone, right?

936
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,389
And so for example, if I take the cone as
r plus to the n,

937
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:09,849
than This inequality here, means simply
that you have componentwise inequality.

938
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:11,270
It means that each element, I mean,

939
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:15,330
technically what it means is that y minus
x is in the nonnegative orthant.

940
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,480
Nonnegative orthant is all vectors with
all entries nonnegative.

941
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,360
So, that means this, right?

942
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,616
So, ok.

943
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:23,800
Matrix inequality.

944
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,290
You've already seen this presumably
somewhere.

945
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,795
It says this, it says that one matrix is
less than another.

946
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:30,160
You'd say x is less than or

947
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,850
equal to y with the represent to the
positive semi definite cone.

948
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,460
That would be the formal reading of this.

949
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,330
And that means simply that the difference
is positive semi definitive.

950
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,690
But you've seen this before.

951
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,195
You've seen matrix inequality.

952
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:46,780
Now these two are so common...

953
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,410
That we simply, we drop the subscript.

954
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:55,510
So if you see two vectors and somebody
writes that or if you see two matrices and

955
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,110
they write that.

956
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,780
I should emphasize the curvature a little
bit more, like that, right?

957
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:08,518
The default is that the default subscript
that you will fill in is r plus to the n.

958
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:13,210
And Sn plus here, okay, meaning so if you
see x squiggly y and their vectors,

959
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:17,626
that means element y's and if their
matrices, it means with respect, if their

960
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:25,220
symmetric matrices, it means with respect
to positive semidefinite cone, 'kay?

961
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,765
So these are kind of standard.

962
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:31,187
>> Now when you introduce some notation
like this, you know obviously the point of

963
00:55:31,187 --> 00:55:36,150
introducing notation like that is it's
supposed to evoke.

964
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,260
It's supposed to be like ordinary
inequality.

965
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,371
But ordinary inequality is defined only
for numbers right so

966
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:49,440
you know when you generalize notation or
something like that or overload it.

967
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,806
The idea is it's supposed to suggest
things that are true, for

968
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:56,840
the, the original, the, the non
generalized one.

969
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,637
It's supposed to suggest things that are
true in the generalized setting, 'kay.

970
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:03,470
By the way not everything it suggests will
be true.

971
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,674
So you, you're going to have to be very
careful.

972
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:07,810
So for example how about this.

973
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,780
It says that if x is less than or equal to
y with respect to a cone and

974
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:15,820
u is less than v then You know, x plus u
is lesser or equal to y plus u.

975
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,820
By the, by the way, you have to, you have
to check this.

976
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,420
I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm allowed to
just say this but

977
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,490
then you should take random ones of these
and just check that it's true, all right?

978
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:30,247
So so And it kind of makes sense, right?

979
00:56:30,247 --> 00:56:32,821
You know, one number is less than another,
another number is less than another,

980
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:35,688
then the sum of these 2 is less than the
sum of those 2.

981
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:36,438
I mean, okay.

982
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:37,187
Fine.
Right?

983
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:39,351
So, so that, that's, that's true.

984
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:40,674
Okay.
I'll tell you what is,

985
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:43,100
there're some things that are not true.

986
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,710
Here's one.

987
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,070
Here's something true for numbers.

988
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,870
For any 2 numbers x and y, either x is
less than or equal to y, or

989
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,970
y is less than or equal to x.

990
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,580
That's a, that's true for numbers.

991
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,760
And by the way that's got a name for a
ordering, a partial ordering.

992
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,896
That's called a total ordering a linear
ordering if, and so

993
00:56:58,896 --> 00:57:02,930
if you've seen this in some class
somewhere, great.

994
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,850
So that, that's what it means.

995
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,710
But, in general you don't have that.

996
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:13,714
And in fact that's what it means I guess
in general to be a partial ordering.

997
00:57:13,714 --> 00:57:17,726
So we can actually have cases where one
vector is not less than another,

998
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,718
in which case, well I'll say something in
a minute and

999
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:25,002
the other vector is not less than the
other one, in which case we say that x and

1000
00:57:25,002 --> 00:57:31,630
y are incomparable, that's one name for
it, right?

1001
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:35,430
And you don't have that on r with ordinary
inequality.

1002
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,760
>> You can't say, you know, 12.6 and minus
2.3 and say No, I'm sorry.

1003
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,220
They're, they're incomparable.

1004
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,380
They're.
Neither is bigger than the other.

1005
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,080
I mean, it's silly.

1006
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:45,951
Right?

1007
00:57:45,951 --> 00:57:47,180
But this already happens.

1008
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,710
I mean, I, obviously it happens for
vectors immediately.

1009
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:53,987
In fact somebody give me a pair of
incomparable vectors,

1010
00:57:53,987 --> 00:58:01,486
with respect to the order, the ordering
generated by say, r plus 2.

1011
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:02,375
>> [INAUDIBLE] Thank you.
So there you go.

1012
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,138
2,1.

1013
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:06,240
And 1, 2.

1014
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,180
And it is, this is false, right, and this
is false, right, and so

1015
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,022
they're just incomparable.

1016
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:18,207
Okay and what happens then is this, and
you're going to have to get use to this,

1017
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:21,540
it's actually going to play a big role in
the course.

1018
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,940
And it's, I mean it's a very basic thing,
so you have to think through all this.

1019
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,670
It's going to, it actually quite
interesting, it's this.

1020
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,843
What happens when you go from a linear
ordering or

1021
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:32,275
total ordering to partial ordering is the
following.

1022
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,165
By the way a lot of things you think are,
are still true.

1023
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:39,425
But the one thing that happens that's
really interesting is your idea of

1024
00:58:39,425 --> 00:58:43,560
minimum, or smallest or something like
that.

1025
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,040
It splits into two different concepts.

1026
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,190
That's what happens.

1027
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,910
And so, they're called minimum and
minimal, and

1028
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:54,680
it just says it's a much more complicated
idea.

1029
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,515
And let's see why.

1030
00:58:56,515 --> 00:58:59,350
I mean there's actually other things in
between, but let's look at them, and

1031
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,150
by the way, we're not doing this for the
math.

1032
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,892
You'll see that,

1033
00:59:02,892 --> 00:59:07,137
you'll see later that this has all sorts
of like real implications.

1034
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:10,139
so, a minimum element, you say you have a
set S,

1035
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:14,730
then A minimum element is defined to be
this.

1036
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:19,274
It is a point in the set like this, you
would say that x is the minimum element if

1037
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:23,676
it is comparable to every other element in
this set and it's smaller than or

1038
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:27,035
equal to it.

1039
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:32,200
That, that's what it means to be the
minimum element, and yes it's unique.

1040
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,360
But that's easy to show, actually.

1041
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,072
Because you know if x, you have x less
than x and the other way around so,

1042
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:42,002
okay, okay that's the idea of a minimum.

1043
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:46,430
A minimal element is going to be this.

1044
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:52,060
It says that a point in a set is a minimal
element...

1045
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,820
if the following holds.

1046
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,925
It says that if you're in the set and
you're less than or

1047
00:59:56,925 --> 01:00:01,920
equal to that point, then you're equal to
the point, right?

1048
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,940
Now you can rewrite this.

1049
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,240
There's other definitions of minimal.

1050
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,523
You can rewrite it and stuff like that,
and right now this utterly context free so

1051
01:00:07,523 --> 01:00:09,195
it means nothing.

1052
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:12,534
But later this will You'll actually
realize it's actually quite useful and

1053
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:15,025
quite important, right, that the, this
idea and just to,

1054
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:18,523
just to start getting the idea in your
mind now for what, what the difference is,

1055
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:22,400
geometrically, it's this.

1056
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,624
Let's look an example, the cone is with
respect to R plus 2 and so

1057
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:29,468
what that means is, we have points here
and what it says is if that's, for

1058
01:00:29,468 --> 01:00:36,290
example, x These are all the points that
are bigger than or equal to x, right.

1059
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,140
And these are all the points that are less
than or equal to x in this cone.

1060
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,615
And what are these points here?

1061
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:45,160
Incomparable, right?

1062
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,040
So these are all the points, these are the
points that are incomparable with x.

1063
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,605
Right.
It is,

1064
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,720
it is neither true that x is less than or
equal to them or

1065
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,362
that they are less than or equal to x.

1066
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:56,675
Okay, so.

1067
01:00:56,675 --> 01:01:00,905
Minimum says the following, it says that
if you are in s

1068
01:01:00,905 --> 01:01:08,220
than you must be comparable to it and
bigger than or equal to it.

1069
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,790
And that says that the set s has to lie
sort of like, like that.

1070
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,430
Right.
It says, it's, so it's, it's over here.

1071
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,249
And it's in, it's, that's the point.

1072
01:01:18,249 --> 01:01:18,870
X.
Right.

1073
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:19,700
So that's this picture.

1074
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,290
So here, X1, is, and it's unique.

1075
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:27,018
It is the unique minimum of S1.

1076
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:28,384
Okay.

1077
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:33,200
Now that's, that's, that's kind of the
natural generalization of minimum.

1078
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,500
Which makes perfect sense.

1079
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,409
Right.
It's going to turn out one

1080
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:38,235
that's actually much more useful is
actually this, is minimal.

1081
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,720
Minimal is this.

1082
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,770
Here's a set, S.

1083
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,160
It has no minimum point.

1084
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,360
There is no minimum there.

1085
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,202
There's no point in that set that is
comparible to every other point in

1086
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:49,750
the set and less than or equal to it.

1087
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,310
There's, there is, it doesn't exist.

1088
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,170
But what there are is there are minimal
points, and a minimal point is this.

1089
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,140
It says that if you're, if you're here.

1090
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:04,610
It says that if you're in the set and
you're comparable to it, right?

1091
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:10,680
Then you cannot be less than x without
being x.

1092
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,370
That came out really long and weird but
you, you got the idea, right?

1093
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,230
So, so what that says is the following.

1094
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,586
It says if you draw The set of points down
here,

1095
01:02:18,586 --> 01:02:23,460
which are the points comparable to x, and
less than or equal to x.

1096
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,509
It say that the intersection of this set
and s2, the only possible point is x2.

1097
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:28,048
That's what it says.

1098
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:28,785
Okay?
And so

1099
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:34,622
that says that every point on this face
here.

1100
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:36,800
Is minimal, okay?

1101
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,350
How about any other, I mean the other,

1102
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,100
there's no other point that's going to,
right?

1103
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,000
Because to check of a point is minimal,
you take the point and

1104
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,425
you draw this set that goes left and down
and you intersect that with the set.

1105
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:52,057
And if you get anything other than a
singleton, which is the corner,

1106
01:02:52,057 --> 01:02:53,720
then it's not minimal.

1107
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,634
So the seperating hyperplane theorem,

1108
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:59,288
it's Quite straight forward geometrically
it's extremely intuitive,

1109
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:02,652
it says the following, if you have two
convex sets, say like D and C, and

1110
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:09,500
they're disjoint then it say that you can
actually put a hyperplane in between them.

1111
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,972
Okay, so that, that's, that's a statement
and or, another way to say it is Or

1112
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:17,850
if you have taken a course on machine
learning or something like that.

1113
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:22,950
You can say that there is a linear
classifier that will distinguish C and D.

1114
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,250
Again, that is if you have taken a machine
learning course.

1115
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,099
What it says is there is an affine
function or

1116
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:31,620
linear function like A transpose X.

1117
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,200
And that liner function is less than or
equal to B here.

1118
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,950
And it is more than or equal to B On d.

1119
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,040
So there's a sort of little linear class
of fire.

1120
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,212
By then we'll talk about these things
later in the course.

1121
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:44,970
But this is the idea.

1122
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,338
And I think last time I,

1123
01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:52,380
it's kind of clear how this would fail if
c and d were not convex, right?

1124
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,324
That you would have that you would have
disjoint non

1125
01:03:55,324 --> 01:03:58,880
convex sets that cannot be seperated.

1126
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,730
By hyperplane.

1127
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:02,876
Okay, and there are many variations on
this,

1128
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:06,150
variations that talk about strict
separability.

1129
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:10,490
Strict separability is you replace these
inequalities with a strict inequalities.

1130
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:13,020
And these require additional conditions
and so on.

1131
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,558
And this brings us to the supporting
hyperplane here and

1132
01:04:15,558 --> 01:04:18,798
this says the following First of all a
supporting hyper plane this is

1133
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,416
something we'll see a bunch of times but
the basic idea is you have a set and

1134
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:27,985
then you have a hyper plane that touches
it at a point.

1135
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:31,430
Um,and has that touches it but doesn't go
into it right.

1136
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,020
So that, that's called supporting it.

1137
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,666
I guess the idea is it's like the contact
point and if you orient it

1138
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:40,650
the right way it could actually be a force
that would hold or something against.

1139
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,170
Another force like gravity.

1140
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,190
So that's a supporting hyperplane.

1141
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,170
This is a picture of what a supporting
hyperplane looks like, right?

1142
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:52,530
So here you would say that this hyperplane
supports C at x0.

1143
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,260
So that's the idea.

1144
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,905
Another way to say it is there is a linear
inequality or

1145
01:04:56,905 --> 01:05:03,600
it's a half space which does not intersect
or many ways to say it.

1146
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,260
It's a point on the boundary of C.

1147
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,810
And there's a half space that contains C.

1148
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,880
See that's one way to say it.

1149
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,610
so that's a supportive hyper time.

1150
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,670
This is easy to say to say the following.

1151
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:20,590
If a set is convex, then their existence
supporting hyper plane and

1152
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,340
you apply it to two things.

1153
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:32,570
If you have a x zero boundary.

1154
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,775
Of the set c.

1155
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:38,065
Then you simply apply to, and c is convex
you apply it the separating hyperplane

1156
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:43,080
theorem to the following two sets, x0 and
the interior of c.

1157
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,230
Okay, so you'd take these are both convex
sets,

1158
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:52,510
they are disjoint well that's just one
point, x0 is not in here.

1159
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:56,084
Is in the boundary and you apply the
separating hyper plane theorum.

1160
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:57,270
One thing I want to talk about.

1161
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:00,210
This will come up a lot more in the future
right now it probably makes very

1162
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:04,605
little sense but we might as well just get
the definition out there.

1163
01:06:04,605 --> 01:06:09,270
And you'll see it's going to play a very
big role later in the course.

1164
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,140
And it's the idea of a dual cone.

1165
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,390
So if I have a cone K.

1166
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,140
And you can imagine a cone as looking
something like that.

1167
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,660
Right?
That's a -- that's a cone.

1168
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,410
That's, that's the point 0 here.

1169
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,140
That's a cone.

1170
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,731
And the dual cone, then, is the set of
vectors that make a non-negative inner

1171
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,560
product with every element of this cone.

1172
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,100
Okay?
So that's the, that's the idea.

1173
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,645
And so to evaluate if a point is in the
dual cone, let's just check.

1174
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:40,520
So here If I ask is this point y in the
dual cone.

1175
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,218
If this is k, then what we do is we look
at the following.

1176
01:06:45,218 --> 01:06:46,706
these, this half space here,

1177
01:06:46,706 --> 01:06:52,130
that's the set of points that make a non
negative inner product with y.

1178
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,915
Right, its this, its this half space here.

1179
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:58,150
Okay and you can see that in fact every
element of k is in it.

1180
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:02,402
That says that this point y is definitely
in k star.

1181
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:03,314
Okay.

1182
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:05,770
That's in k star.

1183
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:09,055
Now a point like this here lets lets call
that y

1184
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:15,470
[INAUDIBLE] that's not in k star and the
reason is, well.

1185
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,434
Well, it's, it's quite emphatically not in
k star, right, because in

1186
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:23,021
fact there are tons of points in k that
make an inner product with y tilde.

1187
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:24,620
Okay, so that's the picture.

1188
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,940
So if you wanted to draw for

1189
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:30,560
example the dual cone of something that
looked like this if his is k.

1190
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,320
What you'd do is you'd go out, this point
is right on the boundary, right?

1191
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,370
Because here if you look at the non
negative, the,

1192
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:40,060
the points that have a non negative inner
product with y.

1193
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:44,600
If this is why, it's this half space and
you can see that's just barely touching k.

1194
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,430
If I were to push this just a few degrees
to the left it would be outside k star.

1195
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:50,660
That's the boundary of k star.

1196
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,730
That's one, and then the other is this.

1197
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,610
I would go out that way, where it, where
it's just about to pull out of there, so

1198
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:59,275
this here, this thing would be k star...

1199
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:03,219
Okay, this example already suggest some
interesting things which is

1200
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:06,860
generally true of like dual relationships.

1201
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,390
So here what you can see is kind of
something like this.

1202
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:13,020
If k is kind of thin and sharp.

1203
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,716
Then k star is thick and blunt and you can
kind of see that, that's the picture here.

1204
01:08:18,716 --> 01:08:22,242
This also suggests, by the way, that k
star is, is k, right?

1205
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:24,552
And in fact, whenever someone says dual or

1206
01:08:24,552 --> 01:08:28,446
conjugate or, I mean there's several words
in mathematics that kind of

1207
01:08:28,446 --> 01:08:34,970
give you the hint That if you do it twice,
you end up back where you started.

1208
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:38,680
Right transpose, adjoint, dual, conjugate.

1209
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,680
All these kinds of things.

1210
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,470
Now of course it's not always true right.

1211
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,845
There might be conditions but

1212
01:08:42,845 --> 01:08:46,430
these are the thigns that are hinted by
just that language.

1213
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:49,225
Alright so, and we'll see a lot more about
this later.

1214
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,540
So here's some examples.

1215
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,952
Let's take the nonnegative orthant.

1216
01:08:53,952 --> 01:08:57,315
There it turns out the dual cone is
exactly the nonnegative orthant, so

1217
01:08:57,315 --> 01:09:00,180
what it says that's called self dual.

1218
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,565
It means that it's dual as it's self.

1219
01:09:02,565 --> 01:09:05,220
Oh, and by the way in terms of angle, and
bluntness, and

1220
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,930
sharpness, it basically says that a 90
degree.

1221
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,143
Something like a cone that's 90 degrees.

1222
01:09:11,143 --> 01:09:13,450
Is actually self dualed.

1223
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,382
Right, because actually that 90 degree
cone is right on

1224
01:09:15,382 --> 01:09:17,790
the boundary between blunt and sharp.

1225
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,580
Right, so this kind of makes sense.

1226
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,300
This also turns out, I mean someone has to
show this.

1227
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,601
But what this basically says is the
following,

1228
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:28,138
it says that a vector is now negative, if
and only if,

1229
01:09:28,138 --> 01:09:33,330
it makes a non negative interproduct with
all non negative vectors.

1230
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,648
But you have to parse all that, but when
you do,

1231
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:38,658
you'll realize it's actually correct.

1232
01:09:38,658 --> 01:09:39,566
Okay.

1233
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:44,040
Another one is the count of positive semi
definite matrices.

1234
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,462
Now there I've to say what the inner
product is and the inner product is

1235
01:09:47,462 --> 01:09:50,884
this if X and Y are symmetric matrices
there's lots of ways to say it but

1236
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:56,770
one is trace X Y and that is absolutely
nothing but the following.

1237
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:01,670
Right, its, its, its the sum, its, its
basically.

1238
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:06,890
Vec of X transpose vec of Y.

1239
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:08,312
Right?
Where I simply write out the,

1240
01:10:08,312 --> 01:10:10,565
I write out the matrices as vectors.

1241
01:10:10,565 --> 01:10:11,670
Okay?

1242
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,950
So that's the inner product.

1243
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,320
The standard inner product on, on
symmetric matrices.

1244
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,876
And this says, now this is less obvious,
this is self-dual.

1245
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:20,790
It says.

1246
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:24,948
It says that a matrix is positive semi
definite if and only if it's trace against

1247
01:10:24,948 --> 01:10:31,220
all positive semi definite matrices is non
negative, so that's what this is saying.

1248
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,600
It's a non trivial statement.

1249
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,438
It's not hard to show, I mean if you know
a little bit about linear algebra you can

1250
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:39,420
show this, so it's not hard to show,
but...

1251
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,310
It's actually saying something, so

1252
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:44,523
what I'm saying is that little formulas
like that pack a lot of

1253
01:10:44,523 --> 01:10:50,281
meaning into a very small number of ASCII
characters, okay, as, as usual.

1254
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:50,890
Okay.

1255
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,174
A couple of others.

1256
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:56,070
Things like norm cones.

1257
01:10:56,070 --> 01:11:00,888
Here is the Laurence cone, or the cone
associated with the, um...

1258
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:05,780
With the euclidean norm and that cone is,
is, is also it's own dual, right?

1259
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,340
So that's the same thing.

1260
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,180
And here's the l1 norm cone.

1261
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,354
And that, the dual of that is in fact the
the norm cone

1262
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:17,099
associated with the infinity norm, okay?

1263
01:11:17,099 --> 01:11:21,990
And again, that's something you should not
be surprised about.

1264
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,425
I mean these, you should expect these
things.

1265
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:25,950
Okay.

1266
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,841
Now if you have a duel cone, of that, if
you have, if you have a duel cone of

1267
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:33,790
a proper cone that's going to be proper as
well and then it defines inequality.

1268
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:39,940
So you can talk now about a vector being
non-negative in the duel inequality.

1269
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,188
And what it means is this, this is just,

1270
01:11:41,188 --> 01:11:44,100
basically, just shorthand, it says the
following.

1271
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,900
This, to be nonnegative in the dual
inequality simply says,

1272
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,620
you make an inner product which is
nonnegative for any vector in the cone.

1273
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,980
So that, that's a, it's basically
[INAUDIBLE] for saying that, okay?

1274
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,660
So that's the again, none of these has any
context right now but it, it will.

1275
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:06,480
Well there's a connection between minimum,
minimal elements.

1276
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:11,380
These are, remember these are the two
extreme ideas of minimizing something in,

1277
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,276
in with a vector inequality.

1278
01:12:15,276 --> 01:12:17,810
And one is this.

1279
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:21,310
If you have a minimum element, that's
characterized the following.

1280
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,690
If you have a minimum element it's
characterized this way.

1281
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,759
If you take any dual positive vector,

1282
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:32,890
if you minimize lambda transpose z over
the set.

1283
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,460
You always get the minimum element.

1284
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,990
Remember, minimum elements are unique.

1285
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:37,510
That's it.

1286
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,950
That's, that's one way and we'll, we'll
come back to this later.

1287
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,950
It will tell you that you can get a
minimum element, well,

1288
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:46,250
if you're solving optimization problems,
you just minimize any,

1289
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:50,390
actually any non-negative com, linear
combination of the element sub z and

1290
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:56,254
that will give you That will give the
minimum element.

1291
01:12:56,254 --> 01:12:59,380
Minimal element goes something like this.

1292
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:06,130
If you minimize a the inner produce lamba
transpose Z where lamba is dual positive,

1293
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:12,190
then you're guaranteed the result's
minimum.

1294
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,580
And so the picture would be something,
like this.

1295
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,670
Lets take, R, plus, 2.

1296
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:18,843
Right?
So that's this cone.

1297
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:22,564
And of course what that means is, that to
be, less than or equal to a point or

1298
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:27,140
something like that is everything down and
to the left.

1299
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,752
That, that, that's less, that's what it
means to be less than or

1300
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:29,900
equal to in this cone.

1301
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,660
Now minimal is basically this, this edge
here.

1302
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,669
These are all minimal because if I take
any of those points and

1303
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:42,400
I put something like this here it only
intersects S at that point.

1304
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,160
So those are all minimal points.

1305
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,454
This this, this one portion of the
boundary are the minimal points for

1306
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:48,860
this set S.

1307
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:52,828
And what this says is, take any lambda
that's positive and the dual cone of R

1308
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:56,220
plus 1 is R plus 2 so it says take any 2
positive lambda 1 lambda 2 so

1309
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:02,670
you take a take a lambda that points you
know somewhere like that.

1310
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,698
And it says minimize lamba transpose Z
that means basically,

1311
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:09,370
to go as far as you can.

1312
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,226
That's lamba in this direction and

1313
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:15,150
you'll find the basically a point of
contact here.

1314
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,798
That which is minimum okay and that's the
picture okay.

1315
01:14:17,798 --> 01:14:18,934
This is the first glimpse at this and no
more.

1316
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:23,554
Okay so lets just look at an application
of this and

1317
01:14:23,554 --> 01:14:30,246
if you've taken economics you've maybe
seen this.

1318
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:34,740
So I have something that I

1319
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:42,305
want to build and produce.

1320
01:14:42,305 --> 01:14:45,050
And that takes different resources and
here I've drawn in two variables,

1321
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:48,250
it's kind of silly, it's with like fuel
and labor, right.

1322
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,810
So I can, I can use more fuel or I can use
more labor.

1323
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,982
And then every point here, this is called
the production set P,

1324
01:14:53,982 --> 01:14:58,430
gives you a possible method for producing
that product.

1325
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,670
Right, so and in fact there could be so
theoretically I mean in

1326
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:06,050
principle every single shaded point here
actually should be tagged or along with it

1327
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:12,730
should be a method for, a full description
for how you should make that product.

1328
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:15,138
And in fact this is how much fuel that
method uses and

1329
01:15:15,138 --> 01:15:17,720
this is how much labor that uses.

1330
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,260
Okay.

1331
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,631
So that's the that's the idea of
production set.

1332
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:27,600
Now the idea is end and we do this in our
end where you would have end resources.

1333
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,860
And here we're going to use the assumption
all these resources are valuable.

1334
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,539
In other words all of them you don't want
to waste any of them or

1335
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:35,475
anything like that.

1336
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:42,260
So, in that case, it turns out minimal has
the obvious meaning.

1337
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:46,932
A minimal point in the production set is
exactly, and that's with respect to r

1338
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:51,604
plus to the n, a minimal point is one
where It doesn't intersect this thing and

1339
01:15:51,604 --> 01:15:54,889
that's good, it means that there is no
other method for

1340
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:59,926
producing that product that uses, or the
only, if there is another method that uses

1341
01:15:59,926 --> 01:16:09,080
no more of each resource, then you're back
to that method, right?

1342
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,253
So that's what it means or another way to
say it is,

1343
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:16,079
if someones says I'm going to operate my
factory here There would be other.

1344
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,247
That means the technical terms it's non
minimal and another technical term for

1345
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:20,965
this would be stupid.

1346
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:24,440
Right would be the other one because it
basically.

1347
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Look any of the other points here are
methods for

1348
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,390
doing exactly the same thign with less.

1349
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:34,550
For example this point here.

1350
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,882
Does exactly the same thing, it uses the
same amount of fuel, but

1351
01:16:36,882 --> 01:16:38,250
less labor, right?

1352
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:42,290
And under the assumption that all of these
are valuable, that's worse.

1353
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:43,250
Okay?
So that's the picture.

1354
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:47,936
Now our prescription here tells us that a
way to find a minimal point is to

1355
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:52,815
take some thing that's dual positive.

1356
01:16:52,815 --> 01:16:56,265
Minimize that linear function over over
the set, so

1357
01:16:56,265 --> 01:17:01,320
what it says is, you should minimize
lambda transpose X.

1358
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,385
Here lamda is a set of positive numbers
and

1359
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,305
effect to have a perfect interpretation.

1360
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:09,686
These are prices, right, lamda1 is the
price resource 1 and

1361
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:12,860
lamda2 is the price of resource 2.

1362
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,990
And it says, set any prices you like.

1363
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:21,070
Man - find the most - now, find the
cheapest production method, right?

1364
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:25,117
So you find the cheapest production method
of those prices, and what's guaranteed is

1365
01:17:25,117 --> 01:17:30,402
that, that production point is minimal, or
I guess they call it "efficient".

1366
01:17:30,402 --> 01:17:31,990
Pareto Optimal is another name for it.

1367
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:34,540
We're going to come back to all of these,
by the way, later in the course.

1368
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:38,220
So, this is just a glimpse at these ideas.
