1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,030
Today we're going to look at applications
well geometric problems.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,680
And again some of these are very, very
simple and so we actually skip them.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,490
Things like computing projections of a
point onto a convex set.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,420
Doing things like calculating distance
between two convex sets.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,140
These are just to simple to even mention.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,980
So we're going to skip those although
they're, they're kind of obvious by now.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,847
Now an example of that would be how do you
compute the distance between two

8
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:26,440
polyhedron, right?

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,460
So without even writing it down you should
know by now that's just a qp.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,726
You know you minimize norm x minus y two
norm subject to,

11
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:37,930
you know, a x less than b and f x less
than g.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,120
Okay, so we don't cover that kind of stuff
because it's too simple.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,720
Instead we're going to focus on stuff
that's kind of less obvious and

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,710
really I mean quite interesting and very
useful.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,806
So the first topic is going to be the
Lowner-John ellipsoid and this,

16
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:58,366
this is not obvious, although these have
been know for about 100 years.

17
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:01,110
Although not, nothing was known about it
computationally, right,

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,554
this was not a algorithmic thing, this was
just theory.

19
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,550
Until maybe 20 years ago.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,825
So basic idea is you want to compute the
minimum volume ellipsoid that

21
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:14,909
covers a set, and it's completely general.

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,545
So I have a set, C.

23
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:20,950
And what I want to do is compute the
minimum volume ellipsoid that covers it.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
So, that's, that's the idea.

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,080
By the way there's tons of applications
with this, right.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,310
One would be to give a C could be very
large, very complex.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,656
And instead all you want is sort of a
summary of, of, C a, that is a,

28
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:39,210
is, is a smaller right, and so.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,218
To describe an ellipsoid takes on the
order of N squared,

30
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:47,860
in fact N squared over two perimeters to
describe a an ellipsoid in R, N.

31
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,590
So that's sort of an compact way to do
this.

32
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,329
And this approximation covering a bunch
of,

33
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,540
when you're covering a bunch of points.

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,462
It's a conservative one I guess so

35
00:01:56,462 --> 00:02:00,266
you'd say you going to cover more then
just the points.

36
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:05,580
Alright, now generically you can solve
this problem.

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,730
I should be more careful about it.

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,770
We can generically write this as a convex
optimization problem.

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,921
So, computing the minimum volume
ellipsoid.

40
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,587
But that's going to be an expression that
comes up in

41
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,253
the constraints that may be handled,
depends on

42
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:23,330
that being tractable before this becomes a
tractable convex program, right?

43
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,274
Oh, and I guess we've we're far enough in
the class that it's time for you to, we,

44
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:30,930
we can actually be more honest here.

45
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,700
And, admit things like, there are non
tractable convex optimization problems.

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,810
This is kind of obvious, right?

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,510
'Cuz if I write a convex optimization
problem.

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,296
But for example, to evaluate the objective
or

49
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,790
a constraint function, is itself
intractable.

50
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,370
Then you're in trouble, right?

51
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,604
So, okay.

52
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:46,822
So what we'll do is we'll,

53
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:51,130
there's a very carefully chosen
parameterization of the ellipsoid.

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,120
And we're going to write it as this.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,090
It's the inverse image of the unit ball
under an affine mapping, right?

56
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,966
So, so, we're going to take the ellipsoid
e to be the center points for

57
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:06,890
which the two norm of av plus b is less
than one, right?

58
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,229
So that's the inverse image of the unit
ball under the affine mapping.

59
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,080
A v plus b.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,980
Okay, now here a here a of course could be
anything well I mean it has to be square.

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,796
Well it wouldn't even have to be square
but we can without loss of

62
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:27,689
generality we're going to take a to be
symmetric positive definite.

63
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,819
Now the argument there, I'm just going to
go over it very briefly here, so

64
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,039
this is going to be obscure, but hopefully
you can follow.

65
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,557
The argument is this.

66
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:40,902
Here I can multiply a and b on the left by
any orthogonal matrix, and

67
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:44,945
it will define the same ellipsoid.

68
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,450
Everyone agree with that?

69
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,027
Because it doesn't change, it doesn't
change the norm, but

70
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:53,970
if that's the case I can take an arbitrary
non-singular matrix.

71
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,520
Multiply on the left by an appropriate
orthogonal matrix and

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,440
make it symmetric positive definite,
right?

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,760
And the way you do that, again, I'll just
talk through it because it's,

74
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,870
I don't know.

75
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,760
We're far enough along.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,990
If we can do this, we can go faster.

77
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,630
You just take the singular value
decomposition of A.

78
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,689
So you have u sigma v transposed and

79
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:16,430
you multiply on the left by like you know,
v u transposed.

80
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,750
And that's an orthogonal matrix and

81
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,347
it converts into a symmetric positive
definite, okay?

82
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,409
So that's the idea.

83
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,772
Now the volume of this ellipsoid is
proportional to the determinate of

84
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,100
A inverse.

85
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,410
In fact the constant of proportionality is
exactly the volume of the unit.

86
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,890
Right?
Which actually doesn't for

87
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,280
minimizing, it hardly matters what that
is.

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,030
It's something, it's got some Pi's in it,
some gamma functions, or

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,770
factorials and things like that, but it
doesn't really matter.

90
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,187
It's proportional to the determinant of a
inverse, right?

91
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:53,123
Because when you, when things map under
aphi mappings, or

92
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:59,600
linear mapping, aphi mappings, volumes
transforms like determinants.

93
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,170
Okay?

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,720
So now the problem looks like this, it
says minimize.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,010
Over variables, A and b, log det A
inverse, right?

96
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,450
So that's the log of the volume, well up
to a constant, right?

97
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,638
Because it's an additive thing.

98
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:20,420
Subject to the condition that every point
C is in this set.

99
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,716
And one way to say that is that for every
point in C,

100
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:26,080
the norm of Av plus b is less than one,
right?

101
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,490
So and you can write this, this way or

102
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,200
you can write it as, I could remove the
soup and say for all v and c.

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,840
Okay, and that would be the, the
condition.

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,880
Right, so that's the, that's the
condition.

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,816
You might ask, why does it say in
parentheses here, over ab?

106
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,882
Because these,

107
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:49,040
well this kind of problem generically ends
up with maximally confusing notation.

108
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,614
And then of course, norm, norm of linear,
is convex.

109
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,230
And this is true for any v.

110
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,496
So, supremum.

111
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:59,270
That's pointwise supremum.

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,090
That's convex.

113
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,870
So, okay.

114
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,800
So here, that's a convex optimization
problem.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,170
And it computes the minimum volume
ellipsoid that covers the set c.

116
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,760
Now, the question is whether it's
tractable or not.

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,705
And it's tractable precisely when.

118
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:18,560
This constraint is handleable, right?

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,220
So here's a simple case where it is.

120
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,020
There's actually a whole bunch where it
is.

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,260
I mean, not a whole bunch, but there's a
bunch of cases where it's tractable.

122
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,630
But here's one where it is.

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,020
Let's look at this.

124
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,650
Let's take c to be a finite set.

125
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,470
So I have a cloud of points.

126
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,240
And I want to compute the minimum volume
ellipsoid that covers it.

127
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
Right, so that's the idea.

128
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,342
So here, well that's very simple, because
the, v and z is nothing but a,

129
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:47,150
it requires that each, each of these
points is in the set.

130
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,119
And so you get this.

131
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,954
And of course that's the Lowner-John
ellipsoid for

132
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:53,600
a polyhedron described by its, its
vertices, right?

133
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,292
So what that says is, if I give you a
bunch of points like this and

134
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,830
then you calculate.

135
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,280
Then you take the convex whole, right?

136
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,800
Then computing the minimum volume
ellipsoid that covers that

137
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,462
is an entirely tractable convex problem,
okay?

138
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:15,760
So by the way these things are, are not
obvious here.

139
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,976
So for example if I, I could give you an
ellipsoid described as, sorry a polyhedron

140
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:26,120
described as the convex hull of a set of
points, so as I could give you vertices.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,240
And I could ask, find me the maximum
volume ellipsoid that lies inside it.

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,470
That's, that's another natural problem
that we'll look at shortly.

143
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,850
That's, that's actually in b hard, okay?

144
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,990
So, so these things are,

145
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,171
I mean you really have to be very careful
with these things, right?

146
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,971
Depends on the description and it depends
you know, whether it,

147
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:48,040
it's extremely easier or extremely hard,
depends on the description.

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,507
Okay, so that's the Lowner-John ellipsoid.

149
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:57,650
Well the duel roughly of that is the
maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid.

150
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,760
So here, we have a this time the set has
to be convex.

151
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
I mean it doesn't have to be convex, but

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,060
then it's actually quite intractable,
right?

153
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,950
So we take a convex set.

154
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,987
And then the idea is,

155
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:14,140
we want to find the maximum volume
ellipsoid that sits inside it.

156
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,850
Okay?

157
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,300
And we do that this way.

158
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,136
This time, we're going to parameterize the
ellipsoid as the forward image as

159
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:27,605
opposed to the inverse image of a unit
ball under an aphi mapping.

160
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:32,028
So here, it's the set of points bu plus d
where u is in a unit ball.

161
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,426
Right?

162
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:37,815
So by the way there are lots of different
parameterizations of ellipsoids as general

163
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:43,540
linear algebra that would go between the
different cononical representations right?

164
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,426
It would be elementary linear algebra like
square roots of matrices,

165
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,540
things like that.

166
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,270
What's interesting is they all have
different convexity properties.

167
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,196
Right?
So the problem would be convex in one, but

168
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,370
not the other.

169
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,740
So, whenever you have problems in.

170
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,130
When you optimize over ellipsoids, they're
actually kind of fun.

171
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,745
Because it's not,

172
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:06,118
it's not like a problem where something's
just given to you on a platter.

173
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:09,000
You have to figure out the appropriate.

174
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,120
Representation to make it convex.

175
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,680
If, if, if it's, if it, if that even
exists.

176
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,220
Right.
So.

177
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay.

178
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,650
So here's the forward image.

179
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,880
And in this case the volume is
proportional to the determinant.

180
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,560
We want to maximize it, so we maximize log
log determinant, right?

181
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,741
Which you recognize as tractable, because
log determinant is concave.

182
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,955
And here the condition is this.

183
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:37,970
This condition right here is simply this.

184
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,636
Right?
So that's the, that, this condition here

185
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:47,088
says that if you take the image, the unit
ball, and you multiply b by it,

186
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:56,130
add d, that this set lies entirely in c,
so that looks like this, right?

187
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,295
I mean this is just a long and complicated
way to say that for

188
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:06,229
all u of norm less than one, bu plus d is
in c, right?

189
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,648
I guess this is, it's written this way so

190
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,330
we can verify instantly that this is
convex, right?

191
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,023
And the way to do that is very simple.

192
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:15,983
This thing, that expression is linear and
the variables, which are b and

193
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:21,390
d, I see that the indicator function,
that's of course convex.

194
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,280
So that's convex.

195
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,680
So for each u, this is convex.

196
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,280
That's a suprimum of convex functions, so
that the left-hand side is convex.

197
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,590
So you have a convex inequality.

198
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:36,895
Okay, so again, once again the issue is
the following,.

199
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,805
Is this, is evaluating that function
tractable right,

200
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:45,140
in these very simple cases where it's not.

201
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,724
Here's one if I simply give you a finite
number of points and I ask you does that

202
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:54,100
hold there, that's actually, that, that
one is actually going to be hard.

203
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,350
Right.
None that I find a never point, sorry.

204
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,820
The convex hull of a finite number of
points.

205
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,560
That's actually np hard.

206
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,148
Right?
So so

207
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:04,381
sometimes it's tractable, sometimes it's
not.

208
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:09,393
But here and has kind of a pretty duality
here.

209
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:13,114
What's interesting is It turns out
remember that, computing the minimum

210
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:18,770
volume of ellipsoid is tractable the
cononical cases when you get the vertices.

211
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,358
So computing the maximum volume of
ellipsoid is tractable and

212
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:26,880
again almost es, esthetics almost requires
this, right?

213
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,472
Because just to make it pretty.

214
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,524
It's the dual representation of an
ellipsis,

215
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,920
of a polyhedron which is in fact given by
its linear inequalities, right?

216
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,550
So, so what happens is here.

217
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,058
If I give you a polyhedron defined by
linear inequalities,

218
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:47,854
then this is really simple because
basically you're asking, when is it true

219
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:57,180
that a i transposed times b u plus d Is
less than bI for all u less than one.

220
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,772
Right.
That's the question.

221
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:02,360
What are the conditions on B and D under
which this holds, right?

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,660
And this is actually relatively easy to
work out.

223
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,184
Right.
So you have aI transposed d

224
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,376
that comes out fine, and then here, you
need to calculate, you know,

225
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:13,880
what's, what's the largest possible value
of that.

226
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,420
But that's easy.

227
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,940
That's the converse [UNKNOWN] inequality
right?

228
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,652
Because it says you have a you have
something which is b a i, and then you

229
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:24,556
take an inner product of b a i with a
vector u whose norm is less than one, you

230
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:32,170
want to know the maximum value of that,
and the answer is the norm of b a i right?

231
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,540
That's [UNKNOWN] the converse of
[UNKNOWN], okay?

232
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,226
So that problem translates to this, that
is again, you have to be on your toes

233
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:45,409
here, because the variables are B and d,
which parameterize the ellipsoid here, and

234
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:52,390
that otherwise, these are just completely
legitimate constraints.

235
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,250
That's clearly a concave function that
you're maximizing.

236
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,400
And the inequality here, again, with B and
d, that's a linear term here.

237
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,851
That's linear in B, right, and so that
norm terms, so

238
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,520
these are second-order constraints.

239
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,434
So there's actually some very interesting
things you can show about these

240
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,483
ellipsoidal approximations.

241
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:14,672
so, let's take a convex, you know,
bounded, nonempty interior set, and

242
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:20,146
it's the following, that there's actually
this basic efficiency.

243
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,992
It says that if you take a set, so

244
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:26,492
here's one, here's a polyhedron given by
its vertices.

245
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:30,512
This the loner John Ellipsoid, the minimum
volume ellipsoid covers it,

246
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,460
it says that if you take that loner John
Ellipsoid and

247
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,467
you shrink it by a factor of N, that's
this space dimension, right?

248
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:40,610
About its center.

249
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,710
That's guaranteed to be inside the set,
okay?

250
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,705
Everybody got that?

251
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:46,745
And so actually what that says is that you
can,

252
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:51,865
I'm going to say it something like this,
it says that any convex set in RN can be

253
00:13:51,865 --> 00:14:00,180
approximated within a factor, in fact
here, I'll leave and try it this way.

254
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,268
Within a, it can be approximated within a
factor square root n by an ellipsoid.

255
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:07,400
Everybody got that?

256
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,410
Now I mean you might not like to factor
square root n.

257
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,840
But the point is, that's what that is.

258
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,570
Everybody or anybody, by the way that
statement is completely false.

259
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,370
I mean you can talk about things like with
other, with other classes of.

260
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,620
Geometric objects, right?

261
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,440
You could talk about things like a
bounding box, right?

262
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,148
And it's just completely false, right?

263
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,620
All sorts of other things you might
imagine.

264
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,100
Things, data structures to describe,
regions in rn.

265
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,770
And it's just not, not the case.

266
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,730
I mean, there are others, right?

267
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,200
One would be like a simplex, right?

268
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,215
So that's another one.

269
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:41,900
Now by the way, in this example, you can
see that that factor of two.

270
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,620
I mean this is in space dimension two,
right?

271
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,410
In here, you can see the factor of two was
not needed.

272
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,550
It's quite likely, I mean in this case,
take a look at it.

273
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,090
Here, I mean we can eyeball it, okay?

274
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,158
Probably, you didn't have to divide by
factor of two, but

275
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,020
by you just divide it by like 20, 30
percent.

276
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,250
And you're inside, okay?

277
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,830
And by the way, that factor is an
interesting number.

278
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,922
You might recall that, you know, how
ellipsoidally approximable the set is, or

279
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,290
something, I don't know.

280
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,420
So, everybody see what I'm saying here?

281
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,850
So it just guarantees.

282
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,340
By the way, what's the worst possible set
to approximate by an ellipsoid?

283
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,720
What is the convex set that is the worst
possible one.

284
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Simplex, there we go, okay?

285
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,180
So, let's do triangle.

286
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,740
Like this, you know?

287
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,406
There's your minimum bounding ellipsoid's
a circle.

288
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,390
There, there it is.

289
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,790
And in this case, guess what?

290
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,630
You have to shrink it exactly by a factor
of n, before it fits inside.

291
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,362
And that tells you that this factor of n
cannot be improved.

292
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:41,028
Okay?

293
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:50,523
So the least ellipsoidially approximable
convexet is a simplet.

294
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:53,991
I've drawn it this way but in fact all of
these ellipsoid approximations methods,

295
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:58,202
they're actually invariant under affine
transformations.

296
00:15:58,202 --> 00:15:59,124
Right?

297
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,091
Because if I take a set if I multiply it
you know by

298
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:06,507
applying an affine transformation, what
happens, volume transforms under

299
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:12,250
affine transformation just by a
determinant, by a constant.

300
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,010
So you get a commutative diagram.

301
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,085
You know, if you take the original set,
affine transformation, optimal ellipsoid.

302
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:22,661
Then apply an affine transformation of the
optimal ellipsoid, and

303
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,480
you get the optimal ellipsoid for the
second case.

304
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
You get a commutative diagram.

305
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,100
Okay?

306
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,187
So it's, in other words, you might say
something like this.

307
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:34,201
Extremal volume ellipsoidal approximation
is affinely invariant.

308
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,308
Everybody got that?

309
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,502
That's actually quite important.

310
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:39,896
actually, it's quite important in
practice,

311
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,983
right because it says that if the x's
represent things, and

312
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:49,130
you actually don't have any idea how the
scales should go together.

313
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,892
I mean if, if it means nothing to you then
there are plenty of cases like that then

314
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:56,711
it says, you'd have, I mean you should
probably whatever your method is should be

315
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:00,040
a finally in variant so.

316
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,367
Oh, I should say something like this, if
the, if the polyhedron Is is symmetric.

317
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,580
Symmetric means if x is in the set so is
minus x.

318
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,400
Right?
So an example would be a normal.

319
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,892
Then it says you can this factor is not n
but square root n.

320
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:15,162
Okay?

321
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,760
And I said something obscure at first.

322
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,380
I said any convex set can be approximated
by an ellipsoid within a factor square

323
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,990
root n.

324
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,500
Alright, so let me explain what I was
saying.

325
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,722
That, that, that's kind of I, I,

326
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:32,370
I take the minimum volume one and I divide
it by square root n, right?

327
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,040
So I put the one that's geometrically in
the middle.

328
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,632
And what that means is for any convex set
I can bruise a convex set,

329
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:39,320
which has the property that if I expand
it, square root M I cover, and

330
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,842
if I shrink it square root n, I'm inside.

331
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:47,190
Okay, so actually philosophically, it's
quite interesting.

332
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,880
It's a, you could, you can argue something
like this.

333
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,385
Ellipsoids are universal approximators of
convex sets.

334
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,360
Yeah?

335
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,868
I mean, square root of n is not a
fantastic, by the way,

336
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,720
core, it's the fourth root of m for
symmetric right.

337
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,640
You know, you might not like that, but the
point is, it's a constant.

338
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,959
Right and that's it.

339
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,659
I mean, it's even a constant that doesn't
grow that badly and

340
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:09,900
all that kind of stuff.

341
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,240
So, so this is actually interesting and it
kind of explains a lot about how,

342
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,720
why things like quadratic methods would be
so prevalent.

343
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,730
By the way one one interesting thing you
can say here is the following.

344
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,272
Any norm on RN, can be approximated by a
quadratic norm,

345
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:32,672
within a factor of N to the one fourth,
okay?

346
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,098
And that's interesting right because it
says that anything, any norm, and

347
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:35,500
there is some very sophisticated norms,
right?

348
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,252
Because it says that every

349
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:46,343
single one is approximate within.

350
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:51,460
Into the 1/4 by a quadratic one.

351
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,390
Right?

352
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,570
So that tells you actually, I think to me
this is sort of a philosophical,

353
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,220
this explains why least square, why using
least squares for

354
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,710
the past two centuries people have gotten
pretty far right?

355
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,449
This, this at least explains it.

356
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,930
Next topic is centering.

357
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,610
So, I mean in here there's tons and

358
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,180
tons of applications of centering, I'll
just address that first.

359
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,680
You've seen a couple already,

360
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,960
even in the first couple of weeks we saw
yield maximization.

361
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,730
So yield maximization says that you're
running a manufacturing process.

362
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,630
You want to tell your machine to target a
certain set of like critical dimensions.

363
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,110
Lets say an I C manufacturer but since
you're pushing it.

364
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,683
Right?
You're pushing it absolutely to

365
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:40,015
the limit of the technology when you say,
please make this critical dimension one

366
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:42,808
nano-meter, it's going to be off a little
bit and things like that, so

367
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,410
there's going to be variations.

368
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,832
And so there you have a, a, a [UNKNOWN]
that describes the acceptable,

369
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:54,950
acceptable critical pairs, you know,
combinations of critical dimensions.

370
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,441
And what you want is you want to tell them
that you want to target,

371
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:59,697
you want to shoot for is something deep,
deep in that set so

372
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:04,380
that when you have variations away from it
it, you're still in it.

373
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,030
Your yield is high.

374
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,690
Okay?

375
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,560
So we, we looked at all that.

376
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,820
So, so that comes up.

377
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,300
And we've even seen some of these
problems.

378
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,898
So here's one.

379
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:15,030
Find the center of the largest inscribed
ball.

380
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,190
That's the Chebyshev center.

381
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,450
And that's this problem.

382
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,260
I give you a polyhedron described by
inequalities.

383
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,378
And I say, please find me the ball of
maximum radius that fits inside, and

384
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:29,283
the center of that we're going to call
that the Chebyshev center, and

385
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:31,780
it's the point deepest in the polyhedron.

386
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,730
Right?
And that's clearly defined.

387
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,194
It's the one which has highest depth,

388
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:44,210
highest distance to the exterior.

389
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,810
Right?

390
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,550
That's this.

391
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,230
And that's an LP.

392
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,500
I, that was actually one of our first
examples when we look at LP.

393
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,524
And it was a fine example because it
doesn't look like it should be

394
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:54,076
an LP, right?

395
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:59,520
'Cause well, it looks like an LP while
you're drawing the, polyhedron outside.

396
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,615
But the minute you draw a ball that should
not evoke LP.

397
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,960
Right, that is an LP.

398
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,985
A more sophisticated one is the center of
the maximum volume ellipsoid.

399
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:17,792
Actually, that's quite interesting because
this one is

400
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:23,675
actually invariant Under affine,
coordinate transformations.

401
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,253
Right?
Now that may not be relevant to you,

402
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:28,277
right, if, if, your coordinates are things
you know about.

403
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:30,041
You're intimately familiar with them, and

404
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:34,640
you really do know the range of each one
and they all have separate meanings.

405
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,750
Good for you.

406
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,310
An affine invariance doesn't mean
anything, right?

407
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,770
But in a lot of cases, that's just not
true, right?

408
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,392
These are sort of arbitrary coordinates,
these might be features or

409
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:48,450
something like that, and you don't know
the scale or anything.

410
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,834
You pick a reasonable scale and that's
about all you can do.

411
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,260
So this is one.

412
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,606
This is the center of the maximum volume
ellipsoid.

413
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,131
There's one that we are going to be
looking at very much in

414
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:01,998
the next couple of weeks.

415
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:05,806
We'll see this, it'll take a while, but
maybe in three weeks, two and

416
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:09,875
a half weeks, and that's the analytic
center.

417
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,020
So this is a good time to look at it.

418
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,390
So the analytic center actually not a,
it's not a function of the set.

419
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,960
It's actually a function of the
description of the set.

420
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,290
So technically I don't know.

421
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,483
It's, it's, it's not the same as limited
volume ellipsoid and

422
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,970
all that kind of stuff.

423
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,550
So here, here's what it is.

424
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,620
Suppose I have, a set of convex
inequalities, and equalities.

425
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,680
Then, I simply form the following problem.

426
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,010
I minimize the sum of the logs of the
minus FIs.

427
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,600
The FIs, of court, minus FI, well it has a
perfect interpretation.

428
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,840
It's the margin [COUGH] in the IF
inequality, right?

429
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,029
because the, the third inequality says F3
has to be negative less than or

430
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:53,614
equal to zero, right?

431
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:57,820
So if F3 is minus 2.1 you have a margin of
2.1.

432
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,235
So these are the margins here.

433
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:00,882
Right?

434
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:03,130
Positive means you're in the interior of
the set.

435
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,172
Well, relative interior because of this.

436
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:06,671
Okay?

437
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:10,200
So here this is the log, it's the sum of
the logs of the margins.

438
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
Well it's the product of the margins,
right?

439
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,520
So this says maximize the product of the
margins.

440
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,700
That's, that's what this is.

441
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,280
Okay?

442
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,015
So this is, and this comes up in a lot of
things.

443
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,420
That's a convex optimization problem, of
course, right?

444
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,120
Because minus log minus arg.

445
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,288
Is a convex increasing function, right?

446
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:36,324
I mean, you have to trace through the two
minuses to see what happens, right?

447
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:39,379
The first minus changes the sine, the
modifinicity, and

448
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,970
it changes concave to convex.

449
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,841
And the second one change, flips the
modifinicity, okay?

450
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,870
So, or makes it go back to be increasing.

451
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,760
Right?
So, so the, by the composition rule.

452
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,471
This is a convex function here, and

453
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,200
that's called the this function is called
the log barrier.

454
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,751
Right?
So its a barrier function, right?

455
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,467
And the meaning of that is that,

456
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,701
on this set of points where this is
strictly less than zero,

457
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:08,189
this things finite as you move that point
towards any point where one of these goes

458
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:16,260
to zero, one of these margins goes to zero
and the product goes to infinity, right?

459
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,844
Well, certain some of the negative log
minus,

460
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:22,731
negative log margins goes to infinity,
right?

461
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:26,451
So this, actually, is extremely easy to
solve, I mean, it depends on def,

462
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:31,383
I mean, it depends how F is given but
we'll see this later.

463
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,967
But it's not a property of the feasible
set, it's actually, it's a function of

464
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:39,735
the description of the problem, and that
will be clear in a minute.

465
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:42,283
But for fun, let's just look at the
analytic center of the set of

466
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,990
linear inequalities.

467
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,246
So these are a set of linear inequalities,
like this, and

468
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,740
what's plotted here are various things.

469
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,010
These dashed curves show the level sets of
the log, this is the log barrier,

470
00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:01,346
and what it's showing here are the level
sets of the log barrier right?

471
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,740
So actually if you say what's the level
sets, what,

472
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,120
where are they equal, where's it equal to
1,000.

473
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,070
You get a kind of a cool little app, you
know a curve.

474
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,589
A smooth curve here which hugs the
boundary of this thing very

475
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,490
closely, right?

476
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,935
And then as I decrease that number, this
number is one by the way,

477
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:24,430
when I decrease that number to one it's
looking more ellipsoidal.

478
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,522
It's not.
And as I keep going lower and lower and

479
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:29,000
actually the heshen.

480
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,104
The hechon of this thing at the analytic
center is actually a good

481
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:38,030
ellipse quadratic summary of the shape of
this set.

482
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,514
Right?
So that, that, that's a good,

483
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:41,350
a good way to do that alright.

484
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,827
So actually in a lot of cases where you
know, you know how to do something if

485
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:49,160
you had a quadratic representation or
something like that.

486
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,946
We'll see optimization methods where this
is the case or

487
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:53,266
statistical methods where this is the
case.

488
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,490
But you don't have anything like that.

489
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,485
What you have is a complicated convex set,

490
00:25:57,485 --> 00:26:00,610
that, one option is to do something like
this.

491
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,460
And, I mean, another option of

492
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,880
course is calculate maximum volume
ellipsoid inside it and so on.

493
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,403
Okay?

494
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:11,310
Now, it turns out here there are
guaranteed approximations, right.

495
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,810
So, one is this.

496
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,885
It turns out that if you form the
following, so

497
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:19,335
the inner ellipsoids is you go to the
center and you take

498
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:27,317
the ellipsoid given defined by the hpshen
of the analytic center that actually.

499
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:30,617
With the one here, that always lies within
the set and

500
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:35,520
this one always lies outside the set,
covers the set.

501
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,440
This is a worse approximation ratio than
the maximum volume one, right?

502
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,350
And the reason is this.

503
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,820
This number here is m, let's call it m
squared.

504
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,360
You take the square root and that gives
you the expansion size, right?

505
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,820
So it says, that if you, I mean, it says
this.

506
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:56,860
It says if you take this thing here that's
shown in dark its shaded here.

507
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,828
That ellipsoid is inside the set, and if I
expand it by a factor m,

508
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:03,412
which is by the way not the ambient space
dimension its actually the number of

509
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:06,548
inequalities but the number of
inequalities is at least n plus one,

510
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:13,190
because it takes n plus one inequalities
In rn, to get a bounded region.

511
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,180
And if you have n plus 1, you have a
simplex, right?

512
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,050
So that's the so this is a worse
approximation ratio.

513
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,775
So I mean it's not clear that matters,
right?

514
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:29,225
Oh one question here, here I have let's
see one, two,

515
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:32,762
three, I have six inequalities.

516
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:33,470
but.

517
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,780
Analytic center its not a function set its
a function of the inequalities.

518
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,460
What if I added a new inequality that
looked like that?

519
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,280
So it says please stay on this side of
that inequality.

520
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,320
It shifts left.

521
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,160
Exactly right and in fact the following is
true.

522
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,976
Given a polyhedron actually for that
matter just given a set

523
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:55,008
I can take any point on the interior, and
pile up a bunch of, this is a,

524
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:01,730
you could call that a redundant or
irrelevant inequality, right?

525
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,510
It doesn't do, it doesn't change the set.

526
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,425
So I can pile up redundant inequalities,
and I can, I can get you,

527
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:11,065
I can get any point in the interior to be
the analytic center, right?

528
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,639
So all that says is analytic center is a,

529
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:19,502
is an attribute of the description of the
set, not the set itself.

530
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:20,158
Okay?

531
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,445
Okay, so technically it's not, it's not a
question of geometry.

532
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,150
Right?

533
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,432
It has to do with the description.

534
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:28,300
Okay.

535
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,600
Another topic is linear discrimination.

536
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,756
So, and if you've had a course on sort of
machine learning or

537
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,880
something like that, or modern statistics,
you'll, you've seen things like this.

538
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,639
So here's the problem.

539
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,310
This is actually also quite an old
problem.

540
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,664
I think it goes back at least to the 40s.

541
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:50,390
Something like that.

542
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,405
I don't know how old the perception
algorithm is but so

543
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:59,389
you have a set of points, x one through x
n, y one through y m, and n sum r n.

544
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:03,141
And the idea is to determine whether they
if you can separate them by

545
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:07,650
hyper plane and if so find such a hyper
point, right?

546
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,440
And there's actually a few tricks here,
you want to watch very carefully in

547
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,365
the next few minutes because you will be
doing these things yourself.

548
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:17,610
And the arguments are, well they're not
totally subtle but, I mean you,

549
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,595
you have to, listen, all I'm saying is you
better listen.

550
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:22,800
Okay?

551
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
That, that's the right way to do it.

552
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,230
So here, I'll, I'll go over it a bit
slowly.

553
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,044
So what it is, is You really want to know,
whether or

554
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:33,440
not, this set of inequalities is feasible.

555
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,960
Now, the first thing you notice about
those inequalities is their strict.

556
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,096
And you might say, hey, wait a minute,
I've been doing this class for

557
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:44,927
a long time we haven't see strict
inequalities before.

558
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:45,432
Right?
And

559
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:47,680
then you might say something like this.

560
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,099
You might think about it for a minute and

561
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,850
this would generally, it would generally
be true the following would be true.

562
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,490
If your problem, if the difference between
a strict inequality and

563
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,415
a non-strict inequality, like changes your
problem,

564
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:03,812
that's kind of a mathematical pathology,
right?

565
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,220
You know what I'm saying?

566
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,019
Right?
If you say, hey I just built a you know,

567
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:12,522
I, I, just built machine that gives you
know, the correct dose on a,

568
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:17,180
on a tumor or something like that, and I
can satisfy these inequalities.

569
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,900
And someone says, oh you know, what are
they, which inequalities can you do?

570
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,960
You say I can do the non strict ones.

571
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,060
They say no, no, it has to be strict.

572
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,185
I mean, it just makes absolutely no sense.

573
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,120
Eh, no sense whatsoever, right.

574
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,034
Because the difference between, in the two
is, I mean, it can hardly matter that,

575
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:39,026
if it turns out, the difference between
putting 49.999 grays on some,

576
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:40,742
some tumor vocso, and fifty.

577
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:44,890
If that really makes a difference, well
then give up and go home.

578
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,400
Because this doesn't make any sense.

579
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,620
This is not the real world.

580
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,240
Right?

581
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,170
Or that would be something like in
finance, at a hedge fund.

582
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,180
You come back and you go, oh, great news.

583
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,460
I can, I can, I can get this return with
this risk level.

584
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,342
And they go, equal, equal to the risk
level or less than?

585
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:05,160
I mean, the answer is, your risk model is
so ridiculous, it's just totally made up.

586
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,592
So the point is, if somebody is telling
you there's a difference between strict

587
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,380
inequality and non-strict inequality, it
just makes no sense.

588
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,440
Everybody following this?

589
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,430
Okay, right.

590
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,800
So, let's apply that common sense
principle here.

591
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:24,010
Let's take this and go like this, like
that, okay?

592
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,716
There you go.
Now you tell me,

593
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,500
now, now, the good news is the problem has
become actually substantially easier.

594
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,018
So the answer is a equals b equals zero is
feasible, okay?

595
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:34,622
Everybody, everybody got that?

596
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:35,873
Okay?
All right.

597
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:40,410
So, so that then, so, the, the the
standard method, right, didn't work here.

598
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,472
Okay?
So that means that

599
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:43,350
the common method doesn't work.

600
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,459
Okay?
So let's do something,

601
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:46,780
here you have to be a bit more subtle.

602
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,790
What you do, is you observe that these
inequalities are homogeneous in a and b.

603
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,900
Okay?
So that's, in other words, if,

604
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,300
if there's a and b for which ai transpose
x plus b is positive, then I

605
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,340
guarantee you, there's a and b for which a
transpose x plus b is bigger than or

606
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,081
equal to is, sorry, is bigger or equal to
one.

607
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,270
Okay?

608
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:07,784
Why?
I

609
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,480
mean you just scale them all up until it's
true.

610
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,780
Right?
So what it says is,

611
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,330
we replace this with this, and

612
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,368
I would strongly recommend that you go to
a quiet place, and

613
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:21,620
make sure you understand the exactly the
semantics of what went down there.

614
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,338
Right, right?

615
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:25,638
It is not the same as saying that a strict
inequality is the always same as

616
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:27,728
replacing with a one.

617
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:28,282
Right?

618
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,698
So you have to make the observation that
these are homogeneous,

619
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:37,370
that I can scale them, and they're, then
this is, then they become equivalent.

620
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,580
Okay?
That's the, that's the idea.

621
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,778
This is a bonafide set of linear
inequalities,

622
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:47,970
in fact that's a linear program in a and
b.

623
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,392
Right, so interestingly questions about
linear discrimination it took a,

624
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:56,211
unfortunately a shocking, a much longer
time than it should have for

625
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:02,485
somebody to look up one day and say oh hey
that's a linear program.

626
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:06,770
Right so, so, sadly, historically but it
really did.

627
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,320
In fact, whole algorithms were worked out
to solve these kinds of things before it

628
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,420
was understood that other people had
worked out other whole algorithms to

629
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,460
solve these kinds of things and so on and
so forth.

630
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,210
I mean now I think,

631
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,860
well there's even a legacy of that in
current machine learning,

632
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,770
I mean there's some weird, anyway I, maybe
I won't go, I, I won't go any farther.

633
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,600
But, so, okay.

634
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,730
Alright, so what does this say?

635
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,322
This says that if I give you a bunch of
points, pairs of points, and

636
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:35,030
you know, these might be like labels or
something like that.

637
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,854
Then it says I can now, by solving an LP,

638
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:41,068
I can determine if they are, you would say
linearly separable.

639
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:43,850
Or linearlly discriminable, right?

640
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,010
So, you could test and if you can, if they
are, you can exhibit or

641
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,710
deduce a the separating hyperplane.

642
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,820
Now you can optimize over that hyperplane.

643
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,220
We're going to see that next, right?

644
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,750
Like you could, you know, find the
smallest one.

645
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,608
Or we'll see all sorts of things you could
work, you could optimize now, right?

646
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:04,970
And what would be the idea behind this?

647
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,480
Well, it might be something like this,.

648
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,130
This is a giant pile of data.

649
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,630
Here.

650
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,580
In fact you'd call this you'd say labels.

651
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,980
Right?
So you'd, these would feature vectors.

652
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,730
Right.
So, this is,

653
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,490
I look at let's say one billion emails.

654
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,930
Right, each one is labeled as either spam
and not spam.

655
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,505
So, that's spam and that's not spam.

656
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,218
Okay?
How do I know that?

657
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:36,460
Because I watched when someone junked
something or something like that.

658
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,010
I got a pretty good idea of the labels.

659
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,105
And let's say each of these is I have a
feature that's let's say I'll be

660
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:43,970
safe here.

661
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,142
Let's make it just like five, 10,000
features.

662
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:47,009
Right?
For each email.

663
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:48,329
And they could, a lot of these features,

664
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,854
these features are kind of obvious that
they were what you think they would be.

665
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:54,302
They would be things like word counts and
things like that.

666
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:58,310
All r ight, so you take a billion of these
points some X's, some Y's.

667
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,042
Right?
And then you'd want to know in R 1000 or

668
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,730
10,000, whatever we, however many features
we decided there were,

669
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,730
you'd like to know if there was a hyper
plane in between them.

670
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,935
And, but if there were a hyper plane.

671
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:11,956
Then, you, then it'd be easy because now
you'd take that hyper plane,

672
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,242
a new email comes in, you compute its
feature vector, find out which side of

673
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:20,290
the hyper plane you're on, and either
announce it's spam or not.

674
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,035
And in fact even the distance to the hyper
plane would tell you something,

675
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:25,120
like if it was way off.

676
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:31,250
In on one side you might say with high
confidence that it is spam or not.

677
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,170
Everybody, got this?

678
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,429
Okay?
Now actually,

679
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:37,070
you'd be quite nervous if in fact it
separated.

680
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,400
Right?
There'd be something deeply wrong but

681
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,500
in this case at least that's abstractly
the idea of the use of

682
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,150
these types of things.

683
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,700
Right?

684
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,582
So.
Okay.

685
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:49,857
We will get to that.

686
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,699
So it turns out actually a very simple
varia, very simple variation on

687
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:56,410
this produces something that's actually
extremely effective.

688
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,035
Right?
So.

689
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,976
Okay, so the first thing we're going to
look at is this.

690
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,264
If you, you have a set of linear
inequalities, right,

691
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,610
that just detects the hyperplane.

692
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,955
But the point is there's lots of hyper
planes that separate two clouds of points,

693
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:08,260
if they're separable.

694
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,950
If they're linearly discriminable.

695
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,580
There's lots of hyper planes.

696
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,436
So, by the way there's lots of ways you
could choose a hyper plane

697
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,230
that separates them.

698
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,066
Right?
There's lots of reasonable ways to do it.

699
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:21,180
One way would be to do some kind of
robustness thing.

700
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,734
And what one, one would do that, what you
would do something like this.

701
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:30,680
You can imagine, the, the hyper plane is a
transpose z plus b is zero, right?

702
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,334
But instead, what we could do is we could
take the points where that's one and

703
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:38,325
minus one, and everything in between those
two parallel hyperlinks, that's a slab.

704
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:42,940
Right, and they can very reasonably asked
to find the compute the maximum with

705
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,180
the slab, it separates the two points
right?

706
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,999
And by the by what's the nice about that I
mean some people calls it maximum margin

707
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:56,990
classify right the reason is maximum
margin is puff up each of these points.

708
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:02,072
By a ball still classified correctly, and
the amount you could puff 'em up by

709
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:07,640
is the largest possible, and still
maintain correctness.

710
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,410
Everybody got that?

711
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,210
So it's maximum margin classifier.

712
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:12,931
Okay.

713
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,560
Completely reasonable, right?

714
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,060
But the width of the slab is exactly two
over the norm of a.

715
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,656
Right?
So

716
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:23,076
that's the, I mean if the norm of A were
one, then, well, A transpose x plus B,

717
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:28,090
literally is the signed distance to the
hyper plane.

718
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,980
If the norm of A is one.

719
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,918
If the norm of A is big, then, in fact,
the slab is small.

720
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,051
Right?

721
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:35,970
So, okay.

722
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,070
So then it says, please, let's maximize
[COUGH] two over the norm of a2.

723
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,980
That's the same as minimizing norm, a2.

724
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,948
And so you'd say, minimize the norm of a2
subject to these inequalities and

725
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:49,930
now we get a QP.

726
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,677
And that, that's the maximum margin
classifier,

727
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:57,010
if I'm saying that correctly in whatever
dialect that is.

728
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,730
Oh, and I guess they would do this.

729
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,402
This is not, yeah you'd have to square the
objective,

730
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:02,230
you'd do something like that, right?

731
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,292
It'd be the same thing, okay.

732
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:08,884
okay, so now now if two sets are
separable, linearly separable we at

733
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:14,050
least have a nice an utterly reasonable to
way to to find a hyper plane

734
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:23,214
that separates them that's kind of luck it
clearly has some good properties.

735
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:23,791
Okay.

736
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:29,690
Very interesting thing is to look at the
dual of this, and we'll do that quickly.

737
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:35,370
So I, I just mechanically worked out the
dual of, of the separation problem.

738
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:42,480
So the dual of this problem right is
maximum margin problem is exactly this.

739
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,680
It's maximize this function subject to,
and

740
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,041
here what you see is something very
interesting.

741
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:53,310
I get two sets of I get two sets of of
Lagrange multipliers Lambda, and Mu.

742
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,540
They are associated exactly with the two
sets of linear inequalities right?

743
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,650
For the the x's and the y's.

744
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,766
I have these kind of inequalities go the
wrong way.

745
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,930
And you get some very interesting
constraints.

746
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,874
I get a norm constraint here.

747
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:07,835
These are, well those are, inequalities,
so

748
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:12,152
these things are non-negative, and I get
this equality constraint here.

749
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:14,999
So, again, everything is homogeneous here,
so

750
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:19,817
what we're going to do is the following,
is I'm going to normalize, these things,

751
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:25,645
here to be, I'll, I'll take both of these
to be one.

752
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:30,990
Whereupon, lambda and mu become, well,
they're probability distributions.

753
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,060
Or they are, I dunno.

754
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,010
They're convex mixtures.

755
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,684
Right?
They're,

756
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:37,470
they're numbers that are not negative and
add up to one.

757
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,305
But if these are numbers that add up,
non-negative and

758
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:44,158
add up to one, these two things are really
simple.

759
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:48,358
They are elem they are arbitrary elements
in the convex hull of the x

760
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,530
point cloud and y point cloud right?

761
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,598
And so that says i can rewrite the problem
to look like this, and

762
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,787
its really, beautiful.

763
00:39:57,787 --> 00:39:59,341
It says, it basically says,

764
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:03,485
take the convex hull of x point cloud
convex hull of y point cloud, and

765
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:08,640
actually calculate that's an arbitrary
point in one and arbitrary point in other.

766
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,366
And it says, this is the [UNKNOWN] I mean
minimizing t subject to same,

767
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,580
you just minimize this thing here.

768
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,188
It's, it's actually says, find the minimum
distance between two

769
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:21,950
ellipse two polyhedra, described by their
vertices.

770
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,705
Everybody got that?

771
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:23,905
So that was it.

772
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,900
It makes perfect sense.

773
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,981
So now you know when are two,

774
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,978
when are two point clouds separable,
linearly separable.

775
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,197
The answer is, and straight from duality
is this, if and only if,

776
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:32,370
the convex holes don't intersect.

777
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,860
That's it, okay?
And that's duality.

778
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:39,716
Right, that's exactly what duality is.

779
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:44,474
This doesn't say anything, but

780
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:48,200
it's just fun to look at.

781
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,785
Right?

782
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:49,487
So, okay.

783
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:55,207
Now we're going to get to a real case, and
in fact, it's one of those things where

784
00:40:55,207 --> 00:41:00,663
you just add one more, one more feature to
this, to the problem, and then

785
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:10,670
it goes from being mm maybe not so useful
to off scale unbelievably useful.

786
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,370
Okay?

787
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,703
So those Taken a modern statistics or

788
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,390
machine learning course, know what's
going to happen now.

789
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,440
So, but anyway, so if you just sit tight,
everything will be fine.

790
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,330
Alright.

791
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,604
So what you do is this.

792
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,684
And in fact, I want to, before we even get
into this,

793
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:29,930
I want to talk about, let's start the
story this way.

794
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,250
I give you some x's and I give you some
y's.

795
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,930
These are spectors for spam, and for not
spam.

796
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:39,890
You calculate whether there's a separating
hyper plane and there isn't.

797
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,187
Right?
And that's probably good, right?

798
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:46,775
Oh by the way, if the two point clouds are
like totally, you know, if,

799
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:51,640
if they're totally on top of each other so
there's no difference, that's not good.

800
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,010
That means you've picked some pretty poor
features.

801
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay?
Right?

802
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,310
But this is the point is that two point
clouds are there.

803
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,675
They do, the two, the two convex cells
intersect.

804
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:00,980
Period.

805
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,343
In other words, there are spam-feature
vectors that penetrate into

806
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:06,826
whatever the non-spam territory.

807
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:09,745
Ev-, everybody, I mean, this is just the
picture.

808
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:10,489
Okay?
And so

809
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,992
the question is, how would you let's skip
what I have on the slide here.

810
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,780
What would you imagine you might want to
do.

811
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,674
So, you have a, a million linear
equalities that you want to satisfy, and

812
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,810
they're not mutually satisfiable.

813
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,910
Yeah.
So I have a whole bunch of

814
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,830
inequalities that I want to satisfy.

815
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:35,310
I solve and LP, and I announce with total
confidence, there is no hyper plane.

816
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,910
I cannot satisfy all these inequalities.

817
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,170
It's impossible.

818
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,879
So the natural, I think one of the most
natural things you might want to do next

819
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,730
would be to say okay, fine.

820
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:49,200
Find me a hyper plane that minimizes the
number of inequalities you violate.

821
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,980
Now if you want to think about a, a
classification problem.

822
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,270
That's the number of misclassifications,
right?

823
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,980
And by the way, if that number were like
.5% you'd be very happy.

824
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,790
You wouldn't, but okay.

825
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,642
At, at, at, at some point in time in the
past for spam detection you would be,

826
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:05,810
you would've been very happy.

827
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,510
Right?
For a lot of problems you'd be delighted.

828
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,640
Right?
Everybody see what I'm saying?

829
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,840
So you'd, so you'd, so then the problem is
to figure out which ones can you not,

830
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,348
how do you minimize the number?

831
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:16,556
Okay. Well. And by the way,

832
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:21,250
then you might ask yourself, what kind of
a optimization problem is that.

833
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,900
And you would find out pretty quickly that
that is NP heart.

834
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,204
So I give you a set of inequalities, and

835
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:31,839
I ask you to satisfy as many as you can,
it's NP heart.

836
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,840
Okay?

837
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,850
Fine. Okay. So then you say, let's see,
maybe there's a heuristic for this.

838
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,600
And what does this mean?

839
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,240
This means that the violations are sparse.

840
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,352
You, you know, if there's going to be
violations, and

841
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:46,490
by the way, the L1 norm should be the
right thing here.

842
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,740
Because it says, you know, it, it, it's
got a V.

843
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,998
I mean we'll see it's not quite an L1
norm, but

844
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:54,048
it's exactly this, actually it is an L1
norm for something that's positive.

845
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,998
Yeah, it's something, it means what you
want is something that keeps up

846
00:43:56,998 --> 00:44:00,090
the pressure to drive you to zero.

847
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,670
But, if you have to violate you shouldn't
go nuts.

848
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,166
[INAUDIBLE] It should not be a function, a
penalty that grows,

849
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,582
it should, should grow lineally, okay?

850
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:09,970
Okay, so so that's the idea.

851
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,823
So, in fact, that leads you immediately to
the following.

852
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:15,660
Let me do it this, I'll write it another
way.

853
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,530
I'll write a i transpose, x plus b.

854
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,502
I want that to be bigger than one.

855
00:44:21,502 --> 00:44:26,260
Okay, so I want this thing to be bigger
than zero, that's what I want.

856
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,150
Now I know that I can't, I actually can't
choose an A and B.

857
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,536
Well, that one and the other ones were so

858
00:44:30,536 --> 00:44:33,220
all these inequalities hold, everybody
following this?

859
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:38,340
So I want the, if that's positive I'm
totally happy Right?

860
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,624
So you might do something like this.

861
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:47,695
You might form AI transpose, xb minus one,
the minus part.

862
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:48,690
Okay?

863
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,670
If you satisfy that inequality, that
gives, there's no bill here.

864
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,620
You don't pay anything.

865
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,280
Right?

866
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,380
But if this thing becomes negative, then
you start paying.

867
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,870
And you pay linearly.

868
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,890
Ever, so, what, what function is that?

869
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,564
That's a function that looks like this.

870
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:05,730
Right.

871
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,590
Looks like that.

872
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,130
Right?

873
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,240
And this is called the margin, in the
inequality.

874
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,059
And what this says, if your margin's
positive, no charge whatsoever.

875
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,100
If it's negative you charge linearly for
negative margins.

876
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,565
Right.
Everybody sort of following this.

877
00:45:18,565 --> 00:45:23,437
Okay, now when you look at that, and by
the way, it helps to turn your head

878
00:45:23,437 --> 00:45:28,316
about 40 degrees, then L1, your L1 part of
your brain will light up.

879
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:31,081
Okay?
I mean its the same thing, right?

880
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:31,790
Okay?
And so

881
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,275
by the way this is called hinge loss, is,
is the name for this in several fields I

882
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:43,380
think that, that in both and, and modern
statistics and machine that's hinge loss.

883
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,772
And so it suggests that actually doing
something like this,

884
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:49,927
adding that in would be a great idea.

885
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:53,817
Because, you know, I mean, it doesn't look
like L1.

886
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,151
But by the time you see this, I mean,

887
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:58,100
it should evoke, L1 is not to be taken
literally.

888
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,030
Although a lot of people do.

889
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,770
This is L1.

890
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,201
Right?
Actually it's a linear plus L1, so

891
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:03,530
it actually, kind of is.

892
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,630
But you look at that, and, and sparsity.

893
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,962
The sparsity part of your brain should be,
lighting up.

894
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:09,558
Okay.

895
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,300
Right.

896
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,650
And what does it mean if this is sparse?

897
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,645
It's super cool.

898
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:19,290
If, if that's sparse, it says the
following: it says that you satisfy most.

899
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,866
It means that, that misclassifications,
these are not, by the way,

900
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,672
misclassifications there's even a little
extra there, because the one,

901
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:27,520
without the one it's misclassification.

902
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,080
Right?

903
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,090
This says that misclassifications are
sparse.

904
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,580
That's exactly what you want.

905
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,670
Everybody.

906
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,720
Following, I mean that was a very long
story.

907
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,332
But the idea is, I just wanted to give,

908
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:41,890
I just wanted to give the whole, like
everything about what you're doing here.

909
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,210
Okay so that's what this is.

910
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,090
U is a slack variable here, I mean this is
the way,

911
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,770
this is the traditional description of it.

912
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,240
Actually this is at, a more modern
description.

913
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,965
You don't even introduce u's.

914
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:55,110
because, you just look at it, you say it's
convex, done.

915
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,515
Right?
That's the correct way to do it in my

916
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:57,230
opinion.

917
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,240
But we'll do it the traditional way.

918
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,290
The traditional way is you say I would
like to satisfy this inequality and

919
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,375
this one, it's determined that you cannot.

920
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,040
And then you go, oh, okay, fine.

921
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,880
Then you add in slacks.

922
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,490
Now the slacks are, by the way, nothing
but these things, right?

923
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,522
So a slack is something it says, fine,
I'll subtract something from the one to

924
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:21,130
make it easier to satisfy this, and I'll
do the same here.

925
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,390
I'll make the inequality easier.

926
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,507
These are the use in these, those are
[UNKNOWN].

927
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:27,135
And then I'll minimize those, and by the
way,

928
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:31,807
you'll find out this problem is absolutely
identical to the problem of this.

929
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,380
Plus of course, the opposite ones, the,
for the y's, right?

930
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,620
So you get exactly the same problem, okay?

931
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,360
Everybody following this?

932
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,670
Okay, so.

933
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,433
That and, and you should even think of
this its a beautiful thing.

934
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:51,083
You should think of this thing as we l1
type heuristic for

935
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:55,521
solving the following hard competorial
problem.

936
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:58,905
Finding a hyper plane its satisfies it's
many, you know,

937
00:47:58,905 --> 00:48:02,800
it misclassifies as few as possible,
right?

938
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,535
That's the correct interpretation of this.

939
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:06,010
Okay?

940
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,075
And you get something like that, you know,
here's a case.

941
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:09,370
Okay.

942
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,120
Now, the only thing you have to do now is
you put the two together and

943
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,700
you have something kind of famous.

944
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,399
Right?
So, and I guess the traditional one,

945
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:21,351
I think the traditional one would look
something like that, but

946
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:23,350
you get the same tradeoff curve.

947
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,906
So what you do now is this, is you put
slacks in to minimize, for the for, for

948
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:31,572
actually misclassifying right?

949
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:37,091
And then at the same time you can also
think of this regularization, by the way.

950
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:41,006
So here traditional l two regularization
turns out to

951
00:48:41,006 --> 00:48:45,570
have a beautiful geometric interpretation.

952
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,926
Because when you're minimizing the norm of
A,

953
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:52,470
I guess you'd call it the weight vector,
or something like that.

954
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,655
If you're minimizing over the weight
vector, it turns out, that's equivalent

955
00:48:55,655 --> 00:49:00,000
to, geometrically, to saying, don't look
for a hyper plane, look for a slab.

956
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,656
And in fact, maximize the width of the
slab,

957
00:49:01,656 --> 00:49:04,130
which means that you've separated them
well.

958
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,630
Everybody kind of seeing all these things
go together?

959
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,310
So, I mean, for people who've seen this
before, that's fine, you may not have seen

960
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,060
the geometric interpretive full geometric
interpretations, but now you have.

961
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,580
So, it's actually kind of, kind of cool.

962
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:21,760
So, this, this is given the name support
vector machine.

963
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,870
Here, you have a parameter and the
parameter is very simple.

964
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,259
It trades off, the parameter, now I'll
describe it geometrically, and

965
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:33,956
there are statistical interpretations of
all of these, had to go into them.

966
00:49:33,956 --> 00:49:38,499
But there are, so, the geometric
interpretation is quite beautiful.

967
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:42,540
lambda, or gamma, here, sorry, trades off
the width, of the slab.

968
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,113
and, and this is going to be very rough.

969
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:48,500
The number of inequality violations.

970
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,020
Okay.

971
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,202
And that's what it does.

972
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:51,184
Right?

973
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:55,460
And so you can imagine what, what, what,
what turning that parameter will do here.

974
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,333
This is unbelievably widely used.

975
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,870
I mean, not as much as least squares or
something like that.

976
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:01,840
But it's catching up.

977
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,550
Let me put it that way.

978
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,230
So it's used tons of places, everywhere,
all the time.

979
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,872
Right?
So,

980
00:50:06,872 --> 00:50:09,730
you couldn't possibly get through a day.

981
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,190
here, except if you're like hiking in
Yosemite or something.

982
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,829
And maybe even then you couldn't.

983
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:18,970
when, when something you did didn't run
through a support vector classifier.

984
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,930
I mean, I not, it'd be, you have to touch
no electronics, and

985
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,050
I don't what else you, you'd have to do.

986
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,850
So, but it'd be very hard, very hard to
do.

987
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,152
Certainly don't pick up your phone or

988
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:32,126
anything like, don't read email because
then it's all over.

989
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:35,290
so, anyway, so, yet these are good things
to know.

990
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:35,906
Okay.

991
00:50:35,906 --> 00:50:41,390
Let's look at the idea of nonlinear
discrimination.

992
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,820
So, here, I, we've been looking at linear
discrimination.

993
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,880
We can just as well look at nonlinear
discrimination.

994
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,174
Because, in fact it turns out that the
fact that the class line was linear,

995
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:52,250
was totally irrelevant.

996
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,632
All that mattered, was that it was linear
in the parameters.

997
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:55,909
Right?

998
00:50:55,909 --> 00:51:00,414
So nonlinear classification says, find me
a function f that is,

999
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:05,602
you know, positive on the xs, negative on
the ys.

1000
00:51:05,602 --> 00:51:08,230
Okay?

1001
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,840
So, so, here's one approach to it.

1002
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,359
Actually, there's multiple approaches
here, one which doesn't fit in this theme,

1003
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,180
but we could talk about, but don't have
time to, would be sort of kernel methods.

1004
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,000
But we're not, instead,

1005
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,009
we're going to look at something that's
just much simpler and

1006
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:23,528
it fits with the theme of convex
optimization.

1007
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:29,328
What you do is you simply take a set of
basis functions here.

1008
00:51:29,328 --> 00:51:32,658
And, y-, what you're going to do is you're
going to look at a,

1009
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:37,960
at a, a finite dimensional, set of
candidate functions.

1010
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,730
That's all.

1011
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,380
And, you know?

1012
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,208
These are the, these are basis functions,
right?

1013
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,800
F1 through fk, right?

1014
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,770
They could be anything you like.

1015
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,119
So it could be, polynomials.

1016
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,050
They could be weird exponentials.

1017
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:52,760
They could be things that, that pertain to
your particular problem, right?

1018
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,700
I don't know, I don't know why but I mean,
you know, could be, this could be

1019
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,420
prolatespheriods or something like that
,or vessel functions of some order.

1020
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,080
I mean I don't know.

1021
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,180
They could be anything, right?

1022
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,120
This could be the Igon functions of some
of some partial

1023
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,640
differential operator right?

1024
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,220
Doesn't matter right?

1025
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,245
It just suppose to be functions,

1026
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:16,572
you're going to linearaly combine to do
separation.

1027
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,400
Okay.

1028
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,152
So here it's the same thing you just end
up with absolutely nothing whatsoever is

1029
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:24,600
different, I mean nothing.

1030
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,195
Right?
So that's, that's what you get.

1031
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:30,450
And so this tells you you can do fun
things like this.

1032
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,194
You can say [COUGH] please separate my
points quadratically, okay?

1033
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,746
And that says find me a quadratic
function, that's a,

1034
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:39,440
that's a general quadratic function.

1035
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,280
And what's being asked is that you should
find P,

1036
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,510
Q and R those are the variables that
separates your points.

1037
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:52,045
Okay, so Here's an example of
quadratically seperable points, right?

1038
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:52,759
And this, by the way,

1039
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:56,158
goes back to our question of what would
you do with those ellipsoids.

1040
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:59,574
This would be if you had two types of data
you had places where let's say

1041
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:02,630
a pilot flown and came back.

1042
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,860
Let's suppose that's the things inside.

1043
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,350
And these are the ones where, there was no
recovery.

1044
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,220
That's a little bit gruseome.

1045
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,790
Sorry.

1046
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,730
Okay.

1047
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,020
So, something else.

1048
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,905
But that's the idea.

1049
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:15,560
Okay?
And, so this would be the case.

1050
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,500
It's a, and it's a linear program.

1051
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,988
To compute and, to compute actually just
quadratically separation, now,

1052
00:53:21,988 --> 00:53:28,175
quadratic separation by itself does not
require, there's no curvature constraint.

1053
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:29,070
Right?

1054
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,535
So in fact, in this case, you could, you
might as well, you could if you just do

1055
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:38,950
straight quadratic classification, you
could actually be looking for a hyperbola.

1056
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:39,600
That separates them.

1057
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,080
Everybody following this?

1058
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,820
Right, and if, you know,

1059
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,122
depending on what your data is that could
be completely reasonable and interesting.

1060
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:47,760
Everybody got this?

1061
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,852
If you want to insist that, for example,
if you say find me an ellipsoid that

1062
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:57,850
covers these points but not those, then
you simply add a constraint.

1063
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,978
That says that the p is less than or

1064
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:03,550
equal to, actually you would add p
negative definite for

1065
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:10,730
example to get an ellipsoid or the
exterior [UNKNOWN] b p positive definite.

1066
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,057
That's homogeneous and that translates to
this, okay?

1067
00:54:14,057 --> 00:54:15,590
And now you have an STP.

1068
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,800
Is everybody following this?

1069
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,906
So this is the idea.

1070
00:54:18,906 --> 00:54:22,390
I mean here's a quasi convex problem.

1071
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,400
It says here's two sets of points and

1072
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,830
this says please separate them by the
minimal degree polynomial in r two.

1073
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,272
Everybody got that?

1074
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:35,490
And without even saying anything you
should understand that that is

1075
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:37,319
quasi convex.

1076
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,005
Why?
In fact, how was that done?

1077
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:42,170
How was that figure done?

1078
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:47,699
You take the two set of points and what's
the first thing you try to do?

1079
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:52,064
You first try to separate them [INAUDIBLE]
by linear, and you can't.

1080
00:54:52,064 --> 00:54:56,138
Because we're looking at the data, you
cannot, okay.

1081
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:59,936
And that doesn't work, so now you try
quadratic.

1082
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:02,520
And you cannot, okay?

1083
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,450
Then you try cubic, and you can't.

1084
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,112
And then you try quartic, and you can't.

1085
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:09,890
Everybody, so that's, that's the idea,
right?

1086
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,800
So, I mean I don't know why you'd want to.

1087
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,707
And by the way, I mean one of the nice
things about these sort of convex

1088
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,512
formulations is, you know, we're showing
you the simple ones, but

1089
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:21,700
in fact you can just, you know can, it's
like cooking.

1090
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,320
You can add stuff in, and things like
that.

1091
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,820
I mean for example, here, suppose instead
you want to say yeah.

1092
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,550
This is, oh yeah.

1093
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,470
This is what I want to do.

1094
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,790
I really want to do that.

1095
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,804
But you know what, it doesn't work exactly
and

1096
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:35,680
I don't mind if a few end up
mis-classified.

1097
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,766
Everybody following this?

1098
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,010
So what do you, what would you do?

1099
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,570
Yeah, yeah, the u and the v, the slacks or
whatever you like.

1100
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,109
And then, you know, and then, and

1101
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:47,240
then you have a parameter that would trade
off of various things.

1102
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,340
But I mean, so that, that's, that's
exactly what you do.

1103
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,944
You'd add in u and v and then you'd end up
computing an ellipsoid and there would be,

1104
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:55,370
hope if you're lucky.

1105
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,461
Couple of points outside, couple of,
couple of points on,

1106
00:55:57,461 --> 00:56:00,170
on either side of the boundary that went
the wrong way.

1107
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,540
Everybody got this?

1108
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,360
So it's, it's okay.

1109
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,400
So that's, I mean, you get it.
