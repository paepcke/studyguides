1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,960
So how do we develop this inquiry
relationship?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,930
There isn't time left in this session to
talk much about how to do that.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,730
But the last two sessions of the course
will be devoted to that.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,919
Sebastian, one of the most successful math
users of our time, argues strongly.

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,728
That he cannot move forward with any
mathematics without fully

6
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:22,040
understanding it, to the point he feels it
intuitively.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,440
The mathematical thinking process is
really important in that.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,702
And he argues that the students aren't
making sense of a math problem,

9
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,930
they should just stop and refuse to go on.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,790
And that's probably how urgent it is and I
agree with him on that.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,380
So I'm going to end with a British quote.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,640
You'll see the Britishness about the
problems in math classrooms.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,928
Again, coming from mathematicians, saying,
In the case of mathematics,

14
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:47,144
there is a persistent attempt to erase the
subjective and

15
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:50,854
affective in favor of mathematics.

16
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:53,802
That is a dry as dust, as exciting as a
telephone book,

17
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:58,857
as remote as the laws of infangthief of
15th century Scotland.

18
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:04,350
So let's start focusing together on this
inquiry relationship that students need.

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,250
And in the next session,

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,815
we're going to think about how to take
this relationship into algebra,

21
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:11,010
probably the most important place to take
it.

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,934
And in the final session,

23
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,950
I'll spend more time on how to build this
inquiry relationship.
