1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,814
So one of the best ways to teach number
sense is a pedagogical strategy that's

2
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:06,555
been really growing over recent years.

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,432
It's kind of a grass roots movement called
Number Talks.

4
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:12,890
Sometimes they're called Math Talks.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,460
And they were started by Ruth Parker and
Kathy Richardson.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,410
You may use these already but I know many
people don't.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,200
And we're going to try one together in a
moment.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,905
The way they work is, in a classroom you
would ask students to work out

9
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:31,867
a problem mentally in their heads, without
written work, without writing.

10
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:35,348
And when they've answered the problem
students are asked to just put up

11
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:37,250
their thumb.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,200
No hands because when students are putting
their hands up as soon as

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,340
they're finished it's intimidating for
people who haven't finished.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
And I'm going to just show you the way a
number talk is introduced.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,420
Just the first piece now with the use of
thumbs.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,995
So this was a number talk that Cathy
Humphreys gave to our elementary teachers

17
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,480
at Stanford.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,444
And we're just going to watch the
beginning here to see how a number talk

19
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:00,630
is started.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,400
>> Okay.
So on this card, there are some shapes.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,429
And when I put the card up,

22
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:08,440
I'd like you to figure out how many there
are without counting one by one.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,350
So take a quick glimpse at them.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,747
And when you're, when you do think you
know how many there are,

25
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:15,580
then put your thumb up to show me.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,095
Ready?
>> So

27
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:18,460
before we watch a couple of different
number talks,

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,530
I want to try some of the mathematical
ideas with you together.

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,519
So the first thing I'm going to ask you is
just simply to write down the answer

30
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,071
without using pen and paper.

31
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:33,024
Try not to use a, the traditional
algorithm but

32
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:40,653
work out and write down the answer for 18
times 5.

33
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,664
[MUSIC].
