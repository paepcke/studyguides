1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,220
So you probably got that the answer is
ninety, but

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,100
the answer is probably not the most
interesting part.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,932
The most interesting part of Number Talks
is really thinking about how

4
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:11,990
you've arrived at the answer.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,406
As of course number problems can be seen
in many different ways, and

6
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:19,493
it turns out that not only are students
fascinated by the different methods, but

7
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:24,590
they really learn a lot from thinking
about the methods.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,420
About how and why they work.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,280
So I'm going to, we're going to hear now
from some Stanford students who

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,171
were asked to solve this problem, and hear
the different methods they used.

11
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,872
>> That would be 90.

12
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,682
>> Okay and how did you get 90?

13
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:40,846
>> I well first I doubled 18, getting 36.

14
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:41,797
Then I doubled that, getting 72.

15
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:42,538
Then I added 18 again so.

16
00:00:42,538 --> 00:00:43,104
>> Okay.
>> That was fun.

17
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,586
>> 90.
>> And how did you do that.

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,953
>> So I take 18 and I half that.

19
00:00:45,953 --> 00:00:51,607
9 times 5, 45.

20
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:57,280
9 times 5, 40.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,230
Five, add 'em together, ninety.

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,944
>> 18 times [LAUGH] five is 80.

23
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:05,625
>> How'd you get 80?

24
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:10,378
>> Five times 10 plus five times eight, no
90.

25
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:11,766
>> 90.

26
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:15,961
>> huh, and can you describe your method?

27
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,362
How you got to that?

28
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:22,027
>> I did 9 times 10 instead of 18 times 5,
because it's the same thing.

29
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,478
>> Well I'll do it out loud then.

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:25,940
18 times 5, okay.

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,120
Hopefully I don't get this wrong as I'm
doing it.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,931
I do 20 times 5, so 2 times 5 is 10, add a
zero.

33
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:37,150
2 times 5 is, that'd be 100.

34
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,550
>> And then minus 2 times 5, again, so
that would be minus 10, that'd be 90.

35
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,109
I think, but I might have gotten wrong.

36
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,401
Okay, okay.

37
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,543
>> 18 times 5, okay, that's 90.

38
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:52,972
>> Uh-huh.

39
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:53,654
>> Yeah.

40
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,242
>> So how did you reach that?

41
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:59,428
>> Uh, [COUGH] honestly I tried doing like
you know the whole 18, and

42
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:03,440
then five under, and like eight times 5,
and then I realized that it's easier to

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,600
just do okay, well first of all you are
doing 8 times five which is 40.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,084
And then if you do the one times five
which is actually ten times 5,

45
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:13,470
that's the 50.

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,694
And then you just add them together which
is the 90.

47
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:18,158
But those are little numbers.

48
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,790
[LAUGH] I wouldn't be able to do big
numbers.

49
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,243
>> That's 90 because 18 over 2 is 8 times
10.

50
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:26,174
I mean 9.

51
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:29,898
It's 18 over 2 is 9 times 10.

52
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,361
Which is 90.

53
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:31,893
>> 90.

54
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:32,691
>> Mm-hm.

55
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:35,352
So how did you reach it?

56
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:40,460
>> Well to do it quickly I separated into
ten and eight.

57
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,440
So five times 10 is easy that's 50.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,358
And then five times eight is 40 and then I
just add them together.

59
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:50,591
>> I feel like I should be able to answer
18 times 5 pretty quickly, but I can't.

60
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:53,773
It takes a while [LAUGH].

61
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:58,165
I do know it's 90 I think.

62
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:03,670
>> I'd probably do it with the 18 on top,
and then the five on the bottom.

63
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,887
And then 5 times 8 and 5 times 1, and then
add it together.

64
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,280
It's probably a pretty slow way of doing
it.

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,493
>> So one thing that's nice about number
talks is the solutions,

66
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:20,730
the different methods that are used, can
be drawn in these different ways.

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,378
So, I'm going to draw out here the
different ways the students that we

68
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,140
just saw solved this problem.

69
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,990
So we can also visually represent the
students methods, and

70
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,210
I'm not going to do all of them but you
may want to visually represent them all.

71
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,720
It's a really good thing to do.

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,270
So I might represent Neil's method.

73
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:46,100
He didn't work out 18 times 5, he worked
out 9 times 5, and 9 times 5 in this way.

74
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,480
Whereas Casey divided her 18 into 9, and
multiplied the 5 by 2 to make it 10.

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,142
So she worked out 9 times 10, which I
might represent in this way.

76
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:04,040
Sammi broke the 18 into 10 and 8, and
multiplied it in that way.

77
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,432
Whereas Jamie made the 18 into a 20 and
then subtracted the extra 2 times 5,

78
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:12,570
which I would represent in that way.

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,560
And there were some other methods, maybe
you can visually represent those.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,245
But providing that visual representation
is really important to

81
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:22,105
help students with number sense.

82
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:26,656
And you can also get them to visually
represent their own methods.

83
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:29,942
Or sometimes what I've done is we've
looked at all the different

84
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:34,220
representations and then I've said, well
what I like you to do now is you use, for

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,768
example, Casey's method to work out.

86
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,253
20 times 14 or whatever the question is,
or

87
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:47,360
after working on Casey's method see if you
can use Sammi's method.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,870
So the visual representation of the
problems is really great.

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,298
So another nice thing to do with number
talks is after we have a representation of

90
00:04:56,298 --> 00:05:00,155
the solutions what I've done with students
is to say.

91
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:04,620
Okay, now we have another problem which
might be 12 times 8 or something similar.

92
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,160
And to say what I'd like you to do is see
if you can use Zack's method to

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,360
use this problem.

94
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,222
We've also done work with giving students
visuals and

95
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:17,630
having them match the visual to the
method.

96
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,670
So I'm going to give you another problem
to do now.

97
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,010
So we can think about different solutions.

98
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,102
So this time I'd like you, again without
using the traditional algorithm and

99
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:31,690
without using pen and paper.

100
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,388
See if you can solve the problem 12 times
15 and

101
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:38,010
again I'd like you to show your method.

102
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,510
