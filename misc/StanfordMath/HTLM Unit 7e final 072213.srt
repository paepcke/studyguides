1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,531
So, it's quite likely that many of you put
10a plus 12p for

2
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:09,100
that expression, because that's how it's
taught in most textbooks.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,121
But research tells us that using the first
letter of objects leads to

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,220
a classic misconception in algebra.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,800
It leads students to think that we're
adding 10 apples and 12 pears.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,730
But a doesn't stand for apple.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,050
It stands for the number of apples, which
could be any number, such as three apples.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,450
They aren't ten apples, the cost is ten
times any number that's represented by a.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,572
So, instead if we said 10v plus 1 w.

10
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,272
Where v represents the number of apples w
represents pears,

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,980
it stops that misconception at the
beginning.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,884
In algebra, we can represent variables
with any letters.

13
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:48,140
They don't have to be x and y, with any
objects really, but

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,730
they shouldn't be the first letter of the
object.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,218
So, the big problems I see in algebra,

16
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:57,605
really come from the fact that textbooks
are disconnected from research evidence.

17
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:03,060
And algebra is introduced in exactly the
wrong way that sets up later failure.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,870
And this is as Bob Moses has said, the new
civil right.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,469
If we really want to erase the severe
inequalities of the school system as

20
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,304
Jonathan Kozol has described them, and a
principle that I presume we all hold,

21
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:18,810
then we need to change the teaching of
algebra.

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,070
So, how do we do this?

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,590
My first principle of teaching and
learning algebra,

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,678
which I've just talked about at length,
involves starting students with engaging,

25
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:33,887
meaningful problems that lead to both
exploration and generalization.

26
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,330
And we're going to be looking at some
soon.

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,860
Teach algebra as a problem solving tool.

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,910
Somewhere along the way, something
Important flipped in the teaching of

29
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,560
algebra and it stopped being seen as a
problem solving tool, and

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,580
instead became the end point, the thing
you solve for.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,935
Nick Fiori notes this reversal when he
says, problems have become a resource for

32
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:57,055
practicing algebra instead of algebra
being learned and

33
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:00,970
used as a tool for exploring problems.

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,210
Teach algebra is a sense making
experience.

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,325
If it doesn't make sense then the work
should be stopped,

36
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,722
instead of paring on down a negative path.

37
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:13,352
So, as the equals sign is often taught in
a very misleading way,

38
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:19,350
from early on in school, and can lead to
some of the confusion.

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,566
In earlier school experiences, the equal
sign is often used as an announcement of

40
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:29,040
a result rather than to express a
symmetrical relationship.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,310
And by that I mean, both sides of the
equal sign need to be equal.

42
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,384
Often, the equal sign is taken to mean and

43
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,680
this gives, with a sort of left to right
direction.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,424
So, this example comes from a great
chapter Carolyn Kieran wrote on

45
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,200
Algebra learning.

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,110
An example is this.

47
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,588
Daniel went to visit his grandmother who
gave him $1.50,

48
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:53,100
then he bought a book costing $3.20.

49
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,389
If he has $2.30 left, how much money did
he have before Visiting his grandmother.

50
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:59,760
So, try that problem.
