1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,700
So here are my top two reasons.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,530
You can see that they might match with
yours.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,691
So, the first one, I believe is the
testing culture.

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:10,331
The students who are in our schools now
have grown up in the testing culture for

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,907
the last decade, which has inflicted a lot
of damage and

6
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:16,378
that damage comes in many forms.

7
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:20,074
But one of them is the clear message that
students in schools get that success is

8
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,530
about doing well on tests.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,345
And if success is defined in that way for

10
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:28,395
students, then, they really don't see
mistakes playing a role.

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,550
Now, of course, we want our students to do
well on tests.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,990
But it turns out that having them do a lot
of tests is not how we get there.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,400
In fact, it's probably the opposite of how
we get there.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,568
Students who do well on tests are those
who've learned to feel comfortable with

15
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:44,160
math, and who've developed the belief that
they can do it.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,955
The students who went to Phoenix Park that
I quoted above, who left school with

17
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:51,220
fabulous attitudes, to maths that helped
them in their work and life...

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,162
And scored higher on the national exam.

19
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,841
They actually scored higher than the
national average,

20
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,235
even though they came in significantly
lower, and

21
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:03,300
had never taken a test in high school up
until 3 weeks before the exam.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,080
So, again quoting from Alina Tugend in the
New York times.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,296
If students are afraid of mistakes, then
they're afraid of trying something new,

24
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:21,320
of being creative, of thinking in a
different way.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,380
They're scared to raise their hands when
they don't know the answer, and

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,542
their response to a difficult problem is
to ask the teacher rather than try

27
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,500
different solutions that might - gasp be -
wrong.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,945
They are, as one teacher told me, victims
of excellence.

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,500
So teachers have had to work in this
culture for a long time, and

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,350
they've suffered, as have kids and more on
that later.

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,060
But what is important is that that culture
is changing.

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,810
People are realizing what a bad place we
were in after the decade of

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,170
multiple choice testing and constant test
preparation.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,762
But I would say that even if the state
testing is changing,

35
00:01:56,762 --> 00:02:01,630
teachers also need to stop or change the
testing they do in their classrooms.

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,314
Countries and

37
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:07,065
schools that are successful don't test
summatively, except at the end of a year.

38
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,466
But in the US it's typical to be given a
math test every week,

39
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,500
especially in high school.

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,099
And that means that once a week, kids get
bad messages for many of them that

41
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,090
are harmful especially if, especially if
their grades are are D's and F's.

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,280
But not only those kids.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,980
And in later lessons we, we're going to
think in detail about ways of

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,920
replacing those summative assessments with
formative assessments.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,220
And my second reason for

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,400
why students feel bad about mistakes, is
the role of speed in math classrooms.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,150
In many classrooms, too many classrooms,
speed is valued subtly and not so subtly.

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,669
And one of the main messages coming out of
neuroscience is that mathematics should

49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,040
never be associated with speed.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,496
Researchers have conducted a number of
studies in recent years showing that

51
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,198
timed tests and

52
00:02:56,198 --> 00:03:01,275
other timed mathematical performances
cause the early onset of maths anxiety.

53
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:05,370
And I think the use of timed tests in the
US is one of the most harmful things in

54
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,320
the system.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,516
These tests are used with the very best
intentions by teachers and policymakers,

56
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:13,383
but they're often used without the
important knowledge that we have now,

57
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:16,250
from neuroscience, that timed tests cause
math anxiety in students from

58
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,420
across the achievement range.

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,263
So Beilock and her colleagues, Sian
Beilock, have conducted brain scans to

60
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:28,106
study the ways in which anxiety effects
individuals, and that's shown when

61
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:31,766
[INAUDIBLE] students compute with math
facts such as those required in

62
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:39,010
timed tests they recall information that's
held in their working memory.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,274
And the more working memory an individual
has the greater potential they have for

64
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:44,510
academic success.

65
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,178
And Beilock and colleagues have found that
when people are stressed,

66
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:49,860
that stress just blocks their working
memory.

67
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,040
So the facts with which people are
familiar can't be recalled.

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,055
You may recognize that situation from any
public situation you may have been in,

69
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:58,855
when you've had to work with some familiar
math,

70
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,555
like you might have had to work out a tip
or something in a restaurant, and

71
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:06,750
you've looked at it and you felt that your
mind has gone blank.

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,680
And that's the impact of stress blocking
the working memory.

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,580
So Beilock and colleagues found that math
anxiety impacts those with

74
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,780
higher rather than lower amounts of
working memory,

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,120
exactly those students who have the
potential to take maths to high levels.

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,122
So there's a paper and references that
summarize the neuroscience on

77
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:30,610
time tests that I wrote and came out in Ed
Week last summer in the references.

78
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,185
So one of the things I did is I asked
second and fourth grades students.

79
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:36,978
So I asked teachers of those students to
get them to write down how

80
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:39,200
the time tests made them feel.

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,260
And the students reflection showed that
the test prompted anxiety in at

82
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,250
least a quarter of the students in each
class.

83
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,580
And that anxiety was not correlated with
test success.

84
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,235
And, in fact some, of the students who
completed all 50

85
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:56,000
questions correctly were those who
indicated the most severe anxiety.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,140
Talking about being scared, when they were
asked to take the test.

87
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,560
So these are the responses from the fourth
graders and

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,490
the second graders to the question today.

89
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,990
This assessment made me feel.

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,670
So here are the fourth graders.

91
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,090
Worried that I won't finish.

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,770
Nervous.

93
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,380
I know my facts well, but it just scares
me that my, I might get a bad score.

94
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,700
I feel nervous because I don't like tests
that much.

95
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,620
Nervous because I'm afraid I won't finish
or I'll make a mistake.

96
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,390
I feel nervous I know my facts but it just
scares me.

97
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,664
I feel pressured.

98
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,877
So those were some of the fourth graders.

99
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:37,126
Now the second graders, not quite a good
on their spelling.

100
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,764
But responses were.

101
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:43,076
Not great, upset, nervous, that I'm
terrible at math and unhappy.

102
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:47,168
So some US districts use time tests
because of words such as automaticity,

103
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:51,450
that's used in the new common core state
standards.

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,728
But there are much better methods of
teaching automoticity that also give

105
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:01,170
students conceptual understanding of
mathematical operations.

106
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,350
And help them develop number sense.

107
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,542
And number sense is so critical to young
children that its known to be

108
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:10,700
what separates high achievers from low
achievers in maths.

109
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,556
And in a couple of sessions we're going to
learn a great strategy for

110
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,899
developing number sense and automaticity
together.

111
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,636
Importantly, many strong mathematical
thinkers, deep thinkers,

112
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:24,880
are put off by math because of speed
emphasis.

113
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,540
But in my experience, mathematicians are
some of the slowest people I've met.

114
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,186
And I don't say that to be insulting to
mathematicians, but

115
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:36,810
the reason they're often slow is because
they're thinking deeply.

116
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,716
And I wants us to hear now from one of
France's greatest mathematicians

117
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:45,189
Lauren Schwartz who won the field medal in
math which it's like the nobel prize for

118
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:52,430
mathemeticians and Mrs Schwartz's
reflecting on her time in school.

119
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,740
I was always deeply uncertain about my own
intellectual capacity.

120
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,360
I thought I was unintelligent.

121
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,160
And it's true that I was, and I still am,
rather slow.

122
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,810
I need time to seize things because I
always need to understand them fully.

123
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,600
Even when I was the first to ans-, answer
the teacher's questions, I knew it

124
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,770
was because they happened to be questions
to which I already knew the answer.

125
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,578
But if a new question arose, Usually
students who read as good as I

126
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:18,178
was answered before me and towards the end
of the 11th grade I

127
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:24,460
secretly thought of myself as stupid and I
worried about this for a long time.

128
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,996
I never talked about this to anyone but

129
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:30,250
I always felt convinced that my imposture
would someday be revealed.

130
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,156
The whole world and myself would see that
what looked like intelligence was

131
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:37,900
really just an illusion Now that ever
happened.

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,420
Apparently no one ever noticed it, and I'm
still just as slow.

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,556
At the end of the eleventh grade I took
the measure of the situation and came to

134
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:48,420
the conclusion that rapidity doesn't have
a precise relationship to intelligence.

135
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,450
What is important is to deeply understand
things and their relations to each other.

136
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,620
This is where intelligence lies.

137
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,870
The fact of being quick or slow isn't
really relevant.

138
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,992
Naturally, it's helpful to be quick, like
it is to have a good memory.

139
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:06,810
But it's neither necessary nor sufficient
for intellectual success.

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,107
So, my question now is which of Schwartz,
Schwartz's reflections on

141
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:15,150
his school math experience stand out for
you as significant?

142
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,960
And why?

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,090
I'd like you to write about that.
