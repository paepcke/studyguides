1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,145
Mathematics is in crisis here in the U.S,
in the U.K and

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,090
in many other countries across the world.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,682
Large numbers of people hate and fear
maths.

4
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,422
And as we saw in the very first class,

5
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:14,890
math ends peoples' chances of college in
the U.S.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,680
Hundreds and thousands of people.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,277
There are also not enough people
graduating from colleges with

8
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,775
the mathematics needed to help society.

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,433
And this is causing a serious shortage in
many really important fields

10
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,330
including Science, Medicine, Technology.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,250
So it's seriously threatens the future of
countries.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,450
Children and adults everywhere are
traumatized by math and

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,310
this can affect their whole life.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,510
Do you remember Vivian, our British
Scientist and her trauma.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,190
Many people have that and more.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,060
So I just mentioned [UNKNOWN], and

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,240
their company Reel Link had been
developing a new film, largely about math.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,504
And they actually liked to collect stories
about people's maths experiences for

19
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:55,900
the film.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,209
So they've asked me to ask you to record
your story, if you have one about maths.

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,159
You know whether it's one about math
trauma, or

22
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,410
trying to bring about change, of good
teaching.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,420
You can record your story and send it to
them.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,500
And and you can visit that on their
website and they have an iPhone app.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,690
So the website is racetonowhere.com.

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,521
And these are the words that Vicki sent
me.

27
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,428
She asked people for math stories she
said, we want to hear how

28
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:27,480
your situation or that of your child or
student changed for the better or worse.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,275
Was it a realization in yourself?

30
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,210
An adult that believed in you?

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,890
A teacher or student that suggested you
look at math another way?

32
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,630
Or if nothing changed, what do you wish
had?

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,121
We want to to change our math education
system for the better and

34
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:42,630
your voices are critical to this change.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,008
Keith Devlin is a Stanford mathematician
and

36
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:50,200
he has written a range of wonderful books
on math's learning and living.

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,576
And this is a quote from Keith who like
Paul Lockhart,

38
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:55,069
who we read earlier in the course.

39
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,310
Asked us to think about music to highlight
what's going on in today's classrooms.

40
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,082
So Keith says this: Mathematical notation
no more is

41
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:07,050
mathematics than musical notation is
music.

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,356
A page of sheet music represents a piece
of music, but the notation and

43
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:12,765
the music are not the same.

44
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,672
The music itself happens when the notes on
the page are sung or

45
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:18,422
performed on a musical instrument.

46
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:21,562
And its in its performance that the music
comes alive.

47
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:26,226
It exists not on the page but in our minds
and the same is true for mathematics.

48
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,645
Mathematics is a performance, it's a
living act,

49
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,800
it's a way of interpreting the world.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,698
Imagine music lessons that make students
work through hundreds of hours of

51
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,320
sheet music.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,952
Adjusting the notes on the page, receiving
checks and crosses, but

53
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,400
never playing the music.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,281
Students won't, wouldn't continue with the
subject because they wouldn't ever

55
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,470
experience what music is.

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,890
And that's the situation we have a, a lot
in math classrooms.

57
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,976
Clearly we need to change the math is
taught.

58
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:58,390
And that is in the hands of teachers,
parents and administrators.

59
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,198
This may require being brave and
courageous as most people don't

60
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:06,380
understand how math is learned well but
they still hold very strong opinions.

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,624
And many people have serious
misconceptions including many

62
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:09,708
administrators.

63
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,204
Which is the reason I wrote the book that
I

64
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,380
wrote called What's Math Got To Do With
It?

65
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,452
Some of you may know about the attacks I
experienced when my research results

66
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:19,380
were published.

67
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,624
Two mathematicians who worked tirelessly
in the US,

68
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:25,950
pushing their view that students should
not engage actively in mathematics.

69
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,350
One of whom refers to African American as
Pickininers/g,

70
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,930
to give you a sense of who they are,
targeted me and my work.

71
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,500
I won't go in to that now, but I put the
details on this Stanford website.

72
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,554
The best thing I ever did was speaking up
against their behavior and

73
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,345
standing up to them.

74
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:44,235
That website was read by 50,000 people and

75
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:48,080
I was inundated, really overwhlemed, by
the support I received.

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,910
From teachers, mathmeticians, academics,
parents and others.

77
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,110
And that taught me many things.

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,344
The power of community, and of us working
together to stop bullies and

79
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,790
other people who stop change.

80
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,340
And also the importance of different forms
of media.

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,786
And just of speaking out.

82
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:11,575
The Twitter community helped a lot in
really depowering those two guys.

83
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,639
So, if we want to break this cycle of math
failure and

84
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,630
spread what we know about effective math
learning.

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,710
We may to be brave and communicate in many
different forms and ways.

86
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,862
In my work in recent years,

87
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,740
I've really come to realize how much
teachers have suffered over recent years.

88
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,390
Partly, some of them from the same two
men.

89
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,834
But more than that, since the No Child
Left Behind initiative,

90
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,474
teachers have had their professionalism
stripped away from them.

91
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:39,000
And many have been forced to do what they
know to be wrong.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,072
I've seen schools where teachers have been
ordered to teach traditionally,

93
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,110
with desks in rows.

94
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,813
And then, on days when they ask the
students to work in groups for

95
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,201
an activity.

96
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,234
The students said to them you're not
allowed to do that.

97
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:54,000
How deprofessionalizing is an experience
like that?

98
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,518
In the last year I've worked in one school
district in depth.

99
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:02,010
Vista Unified, with the director of maths,
Kathy Williams.

100
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,278
And that's been great.

101
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:06,550
I've learned a lot from that in depth work
with teachers.

102
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,539
And I worked particularly with middle
school teachers and shared some of

103
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,970
the ideas from this course and other
ideas, we worked on maths together.

104
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,162
They went back to their schools and
started using inquiry tasks and

105
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:21,683
just saw the effect on their students
which made them so excited.

106
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,564
And I could see them becoming, getting,

107
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:27,750
getting the energy back that they've had
taken away.

108
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,444
And in one meeting with high, just one
meeting with high school teachers.

109
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,244
I showed some video of students working
together in amazing ways to

110
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,108
solve a complex problem.

111
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,220
They were INP students.

112
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,720
And the teachers looked at me with some
pain in their eyes and

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,554
one of them said to me.

114
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:46,604
Are we allowed to do that, because people
told us that we were harming children?

115
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:50,142
So, at the end of that meeting, they were
getting their old INP books out of

116
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,490
the covers and planning excitedly again.

117
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:59,130
Sandy at Vista High School was one of the
teachers I met with for just a few hours.

118
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,100
And she was teaching geometry to students
at the course they had to

119
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,770
pass to graduate.

120
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,858
All the students were in their last year.

121
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:09,020
And at the end of the year, she reflected
that one of the ideas she learned at

122
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,619
our meeting around the way to give
students feedback.

123
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:17,670
And telling them that you believe in them
had changed everything in her class.

124
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,132
All of the students passed the course and

125
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,884
they were coming up to her at graduation
to tell her what a difference she made

126
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:23,300
to them.

127
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,075
So these different interactions and

128
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,050
stories with teachers make me very happy
and sad.

129
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,527
Happy to be working with them.

130
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:34,167
Sad that these professionals who knew ten
times as much about student learning than

131
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,251
the people who were telling them what to
do.

132
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,290
Had had their own creativity and autonomy
taken away from them.

133
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,726
And what gave it back was a few ideas from
research,

134
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:49,040
research in what we know works and ideas
that they knew were really productive.

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,820
And I think we really need to open spaces
up for important ideas.

136
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,010
And certainly in the U.S, we're in a good
time to do that now.

137
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,825
And maybe these new forms of technology
can really help with that too.

138
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,793
Mathematics is a human activity, a social
phenomenon, it's a set of ideas and

139
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:06,900
concepts that help illuminate the world.

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,815
It can be seen in the design of buildings,
the rhythm of raindrops,

141
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:14,375
special effects in movies, and the social
networks that connect to us.

142
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:18,864
And mathematics is all about illuminating
relationships such as those we see in

143
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,003
shapes, in nature.

144
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:24,760
And it's a diverse and multidimensional
subject.

145
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,448
It's also a powerful way of expressing
relationships and

146
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:32,540
ideas in numerical, pictorial, graphical,
verbal and symbolic forms.

147
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,620
So let's together introduce students to
that world of exciting and

148
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,210
beautiful maths.

149
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,020
It's a really important thing to do.

150
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,454
So this is the end of the course.

151
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,974
And I want to end with a co, a final
question and a couple of things for

152
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:45,337
you to do.

153
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:48,571
The question is to ask you if there is any
particular way I can be helpful to you in

154
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:51,930
supporting any changes you make.

155
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,210
Maybe we have a follow-up course on how to
teach in these ways.

156
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,129
I recognize this course wasn't that.

157
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,360
It was really just about sparking a few
ideas.

158
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,330
Maybe keeping the forum open; maybe giving
you updates through monthly webinars.

159
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,160
I'd like to know how to help you, and
here's a question for that.
