1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,331
So it turns out that a comfort with
mistakes is [INAUDIBLE] extremely

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:06,585
important for life and for success in
life.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:12,362
For design and for invention, but also for
a way to, as he says, live in the world.

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:14,870
So we've talked about the importance of

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,990
Let's think for a while about why students
often feel so crushed when they make

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,014
a mistake, because it's hard to create a

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:24,420
understanding the student resistance.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,530
So I would like you to just list two
reasons here.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,915
It can be two words.

10
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:31,900
So in as few words as possible.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,970
Why do students, do you think, often feel
so bad about making mistakes?

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,300
What are your top two reasons?
