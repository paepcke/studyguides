1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,988
Mathematics is in crisis, here in the US,
in the UK,

2
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:07,100
and in many other countries across the
world.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Large numbers of people hate and fear
maths.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,124
And as we saw in the very first class,
math ends people's chances for

5
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:14,900
college in the US.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,690
Hundreds and thousands of people.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,287
There are also not enough people
graduating from colleges with

8
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,100
the mathematics needed to help society.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,130
And this is causing a serious shortage in
many really important fields.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,340
Including science, medicine, technology.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,270
So it seriously threatens the future of
countries.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,750
Children and adults everywhere are
traumatized by math.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,210
And this can affect their whole life.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,168
Do you remember Vivian our British
scientist, and her trauma?

15
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,180
Many people have that and more.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,915
So, I just mentioned Race to Nowhere.

17
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:51,230
And their Real Link are developing a new
film largely about math.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,480
And they'd also like to collect stories
about people's maths experiences for

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,900
the film.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,477
So, they've asked me to ask you to record
your story, if you have one, about maths.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,515
You know, whether it's one of math trauma,
or trying to bring about change,

22
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:07,460
of good teaching, you can record your
story and send it to them.

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,940
And you can visit that on their website.

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,730
They have an iPhone app, so the website is
racetonowhere.com.

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,525
And these are the words that Vicky sent
me.

26
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,590
She asked for peoples' math stories, and
she said.

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,034
We want to hear how your situation or that
of your child or

28
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:27,470
student changed for the better or worse.

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,275
Was it a realization in yourself?

30
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,200
An adult that believed in you?

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,900
A teacher or student that suggested you
look at math another way?

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,630
Or if nothing changed, what do you wish
had?

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,078
We want to change our math education
system for the better and

34
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,630
your voices are critical to this change.

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,150
Keith Devlin is a Stanford mathematician.

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,210
And he's written a range of wonderful
books on maths, learning, and living.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,710
And this is a quote from Keith,

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,650
who like Paul Lockhart, who we read
earlier in the course.

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,320
Asked us to think about music to highlight
what's going on in today's classrooms.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
So Keith says this.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,860
Mathematical notation no more is
mathematics than musical

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,490
notation is music.

43
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,853
A page of sheet musics represents a piece
of music, but the notation and

44
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,720
the music are not the same.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,321
The music itself happens when the notes on
the page are sung or

46
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,200
performed on a musical instrument.

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,975
And it's in its performance that the music
comes alive.

48
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,141
It exists not on the page, but in our
minds, and

49
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:25,680
the same is true for mathematics.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
Mathematics is a performance.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,630
It's a living act.

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,810
It's a way of interpreting the world.

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,848
Imagine music lessons in which students
work through hundreds of hours of

54
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,808
sheet music, adjusting the notes on the
page, or

55
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:41,460
seeing checks and crosses, but never
playing the music.

56
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,371
Student's wouldn't, wouldn't continue with
the subject because they wouldn't ever

57
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,470
experience what music is.

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,390
And that's the situation we have a, a lot
in math classrooms.

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,010
Clearly, we need to change the way maths
is taught.

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,390
And that is in the hands of teachers,
parents, and administrators.

61
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,659
This may require being brave and

62
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,880
courageous, as most people don't
understand how maths is learned well.

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,390
But they still hold very strong opinions.

64
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,477
And many people have serious
misconceptions, including administrators,

65
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:14,380
which is the reason I wrote the book I
wrote, What's Math Got To Do With It.

66
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,516
Some of you may know about the attacks I
experienced when my research results

67
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:19,369
were published.

68
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,480
Two mathematicians who worked tirelessly
in the US pushing the idea that

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,700
students should not engage actively in
mathematics.

70
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,250
Targeted me in my work.

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,810
I won't go into that now, but I put the
details on the Stanford website.

72
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,314
The best thing I ever did was speaking up
against their behavior and

73
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,770
standing up to them.

74
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,074
That website was read by 50,000 people,
and

75
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:43,234
I was inundated, really overwhelmed by the
support I received from teachers,

76
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:48,230
mathematicians, Academics, parents, and
others.

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,443
And that taught me many things, the power
of community and

78
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:57,110
of us working together, to stop bullies
and other people who stop change.

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,650
And the, also the importance of different
forms of media.

80
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,103
And just of speaking out.

81
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:06,925
The Twitter community helped a lot in
really de-powering those two guys.

82
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,075
So if we want to break the cycle of maths
failure, and

83
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:12,325
spread what we know about effective math
learning, we may have to be brave, and

84
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:16,030
communicate in many different forms and
ways.

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,182
In my work in recent years,

86
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:22,070
I've really come to realize how much
teachers have suffered over recent years.

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,700
Partly, some of them, from the same two
men.

88
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,144
But more than that, since the No Child
Left Behind initiative,

89
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,917
teachers have had their professionalism
stripped away from them, and

90
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:34,320
many have been forced to do what they know
to be wrong.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,584
I've seen schools, where teachers have
been ordered to teach traditionally with

92
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,704
desks in rows, and then on days when they
ask the students to work in groups, for

93
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:44,070
an activity, the students center them.

94
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,220
You're not allowed to do that.

95
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,170
How de-professionalizing is an experience
like that?

96
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,084
In the last year, I've work in one school
district in depth,

97
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,319
Vista Unified, with the director of maths,
Kathy Williams.

98
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,578
And that's been great.

99
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:01,860
I've learned a lot from that in-depth work
with teachers.

100
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,800
And I work particularly with middle school
teachers, and shared some of

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,270
the ideas with this course, and other
ideas, we worked on maths together.

102
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,348
They went back to their schools and
started using inquiry tasks, and

103
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:16,630
just saw the effect on their students,
which made them so excited.

104
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,520
I could see them becoming, getting,

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,060
getting the energy back that they had had
taken away.

106
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,236
And in one meeting with high,

107
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,637
just one meeting with high school
teachers, I showed some,

108
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:31,458
a video of students working together in
amazing ways to solve a complex problem.

109
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,530
They were I and P students.

110
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,182
And the teachers looked at me with some
pain in their eyes, and

111
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:39,550
one of them said to me, are we allowed to
do that?

112
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,995
Because people told us we were harming
children.

113
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:44,596
So at the end of that meeting, they were
getting their old I and

114
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:48,790
P books out of back of the cupboards and
planning excitedly again.

115
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:53,380
Sunday at Vista High School was one of the
teachers I met with for just a few hours,

116
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,060
and she was teaching geometry to students
the course they had to pass to graduate.

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,480
All the students were in their last year.

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,064
And at the end of the year, she reflected
that one of the ideas she'd learned at

119
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,696
our meeting around the way to give
students feedback and

120
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:12,980
telling them that you believe in them, had
changed everything in her class.

121
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,450
All of the students passed the course and,

122
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,222
they were coming up to her at graduation
to tell her what a difference she'd made

123
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,610
to them.

124
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,272
So these different interactions and

125
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:24,704
stories with teachers make me very happy
and sad, happy to be working with them,

126
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:28,188
sad that these professionals who knew ten
times as much about student learning,

127
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,672
than the people who were telling them what
to do, had had their own creativity and

128
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:36,560
autonomy taken away from them.

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,720
And what gave it back was a few ideas from
research.

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,960
Research of what we know works.

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,330
And ideas that they knew were really
productive.

132
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,140
And I think we really need to open spaces
up for important ideas.

133
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,310
And certainly, in the US, we're in a good
time to do that now.

134
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,930
And maybe these new forms of technology
can really help with that, too.

135
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,240
Mathematics is a human activity, a social
phenomenon.

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,210
It's a set of ideas and concepts that help
illuminate the world.

137
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,235
It can be seen in the design of buildings,
the rhythm of raindrops,

138
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:09,685
special effects in movies and the social
networks that connect us.

139
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,835
And mathematics is all about illuminating
relationships,

140
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:16,740
such as those we see in shapes, in nature.

141
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,070
And it's a diverse and multidimensional
subject.

142
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,702
It's also a powerful way of expressing
relationship and

143
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:27,860
ideas in numerical, pictorial, graphical,
verbal, and symbolic forms.

144
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,046
So let's together introduce students that
we're on about exciting and

145
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:32,530
beautiful maths.

146
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,339
It's a really important thing to do.

147
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,253
So this is the end of the course, and I
want to end with a, a final question and

148
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:41,026
a couple of things for you to do the
question is to ask you, if there is

149
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:47,260
any particular way I can be helpful to you
in supporting any changes you may.

150
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,530
Maybe we have a follow-up course on how to
teach in these ways.

151
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,690
I recognize this course wasn't that it was
just about sparking a few ideas.

152
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,660
Maybe keeping the forum open, maybe giving
you updates through monthly webinars.

153
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,480
I'd like to know how to help you and
here's a question for that.
