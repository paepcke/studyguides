1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:05,578
So, students will often write this; 230
plus 320

2
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:10,576
equals 550 minus 150 equals 4.

3
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:13,969
Which violates the equals sign.

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,764
That both sides at all times need to be
equal.

5
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:22,064
One elementary teacher I know spent a
really useful half hour asking his

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:26,640
third grade students to come up with
definitions of equals.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,262
And then they discussed the different
ideas, which really helped to

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,470
set them off on a good path that won't
cause them to slip up later in algebra.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,992
The fact that the equal sign means
equivalent is an important idea in

10
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:40,400
helping students make sense of algebra.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,189
So, also we need to represent algebra in
multiple ways, and

12
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:48,330
where possible, multiple forms.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,786
So, we can represent that symbolic
expression visually,

14
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:58,701
graphically, through words, and a great,
it's a great principle for algebra.

15
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:02,421
In fact, one of the greatest algebra
books, calculus text books, sorry,

16
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:07,260
that I have seen used this, what they
called the principle of 4.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,740
So, these were calculus text books
developed by faculty at Harvard,

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,910
the Harvard Calculus Consortium.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,618
And the principle of four was,

20
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,010
every situation should be described in at
least four ways.

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,640
From words, a picture, a graph, a table,
and symbols.

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,970
And then a really good teaching approach I
studied, where they had

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,041
a similar principle, the students color
coded the different representations.

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,869
For example, if you have an expression x
plus three, you could say,

25
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,720
well, this is my plus 3 in the, in the
line, in the graph.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,420
This is the plus three in the visual of
the cases.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,730
This is the plus three in the expression.

28
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,440
Everything's color coded.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,720
And that's really helpful in teaching
important connections.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,990
And you can see this color coding in the
picture from that school.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,342
Connections and different representations
lead to deeper learning, and

32
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:07,988
a focus on the structural not only the
procedural role of algebra.

33
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:11,221
Even a multiple representation of one
form, the symbolic form,

34
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,140
can unleash incredible understanding.

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,044
So, here's a fairly standard algebra
question, not really my favorite type,

36
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,500
but with an added twist.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,018
So, try this question now.

38
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,043
There are three piles of rock, A,

39
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:30,790
B and C, where B has 2 more than A and C
has 4 times as many rocks as A.

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,840
The total number of rocks is 14.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,020
Find the number of rocks in each pile
using x.

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,368
And do the problem in three different
ways,

43
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,934
using the x in three different positions.
