00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:06,213
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,099
So you may think, if you're a high-school
math teacher,

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,618
why go through that when you can use the
formula A plus B over A times B.

4
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:14,474
Thee is a very good reason for going
through that longer method, and

5
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,040
it's about thinking and making sense.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,548
When we provide students with formulas
that they don't understand,

7
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:21,690
they're not useful to them.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,310
If you're lucky, they may use them in a
test, but often, they don't even do that.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,711
You may have used another method that's
more conceptual or

10
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,530
a whole different approach.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,784
So one thing that's missing from most
students' math lives and

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,292
that would help them enormously is knowing
about and

13
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:42,740
engaging in what I call the mathematical
thinking process.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,540
So this is my proposed thinking process
for solving any math question.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,279
So the first thing I do is I read a
question and

16
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,410
think about what it's telling me.

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,480
I just sit with it for a while.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,450
I look at it, think about the numbers.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,202
Students often don't do that as they think
they should instantly know a method or

20
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,130
a formula to apply.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,020
I make a lot of use of visuals, they help
me in virtually every problem I solve.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,580
So my first strategy is usually to draw
the problem.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,927
Other people are helped in this stage by
restating the problem, reading it aloud or

24
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:16,615
writing it in another way.

25
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:21,473
So I'm going to call this stage the
stay-think-say-draw stage.

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,818
Then there's a point that's really helpful
to talk to other people,

27
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,565
to discuss problems and possibly consult
resources.

28
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,217
Those actions are some of the most
important things to do in

29
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,785
any math problem.

30
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:38,530
Estimate is so useful to do at different
stages in a problem.

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,550
What sort of answer should we get at this
stage or at this part?

32
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,725
Where should I be?

33
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:46,670
And at some point we mathematize.

34
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,270
That's the process when I bring out my
mathematical methods or

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,860
tools, and convert my thinking into
something more formally mathematical.

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,860
And that word comes from Freud and Tao.

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,148
There's a process whereby you might try
something, realize it doesn't work,

38
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:04,370
refine it, or revise it.

39
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,550
That process is an essential component of
design thinking, as taught by

40
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,408
Stanford's D School, but it's also an
essential part of mathematical thinking.

41
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:17,349
And then, super-importantly, does the
answer make sense?

42
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,520
You may need to stop and ask that at
various stages in a problem.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,860
So these are the sort of shortened
headings Of my mathematical thinking.

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,720
So I'm going to show you how those stages
came into play when we worked

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,320
through those solutions.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,368
Because they're all short questions,

47
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:39,330
you don't see the
try-and-refine-and-revise stage.

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,690
But that's super-important, especially
when dealing with bigger problems, and in

49
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,190
these solutions I didn't consult others,
even though that's a very important step.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,419
You'll see as I go through these that the
stages are used in a different order,

51
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:58,420
there isn't one set order as different
problems draw on different parts.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,653
So I don't think many students are aware
of needing to go through these

53
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,243
mathematical thinking processes,

54
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:08,200
especially when they have these short
fraction or algebra problems.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,566
But if I was given any math question,
especially the verbally dense ones such as

56
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:16,409
the card question, then I need to engage
in these processes to be successful.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,384
You may be gathering by now that I think
there should be a much larger part played

58
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,700
by visual representations in maths.

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,450
It helps everybody.

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,650
You may have kids who've been given the
idea that they're not a visual thinker.

61
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,530
That's a kind of misuse I think, of Howard
Gardner's Multiple Intelligences.

62
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,582
But even if they come in with that idea
then,

63
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:40,910
they need to work in visual ways more than
anyone else.

64
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,879
Visual thinking and visual solutions, as
we saw with the number problems in

65
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,230
the last session, help us see mathematics
as conceptual and meaningful.

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,390
Here's my student K.K again, talking about
the importance of visuals to him.

67
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,102
>> I think that I'm a very visual learner
so when it comes to problem I guess word

68
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:03,745
problems in math, I just couldn't
comprehend them.

69
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,645
because I'd be like, I don't, I can't
visualize this.

70
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,345
>> How easy would it have been to engage
students like KK,

71
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:13,125
if maths were taught differently and more
visually.

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,073
One thing that's important about making
students aware of

73
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:21,940
these thinking processes is, they learn
that working on maths is a process.

74
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,295
It's always a process.

75
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:27,690
It's not about instantly coming up with a
method or a formula.

76
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,370
How many students go through this kind of
thinking process, or any process?

77
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,970
Many of them think that they should
instantly be

78
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,350
out to solve a maths problem or they're
doing it wrong.

79
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,450
So teaching students to engage in a
thinking process is really important.

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,284
So what I'd like you to do now is design a
way, that you can think of,

81
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:52,050
of making children, students aware of the
thinking process.

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,344
You, you can you my steps of the thinking
process or you can adapt those, or

83
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,720
use your own, but.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,490
The question is,

85
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,090
how could you get students to start using
something like that?

86
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,226
So this is a peer assessment question,
you're going to be given three different

87
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:09,980
com, people's answers to comment on, and
yours will be sent out to get comments on.
