1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,050
With all of these problems, there are
procedural ways to solve them,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,300
where you plug in a procedure with little
thought, and

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,170
there are more productive, conceptual
ways.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,820
That doesn't mean that using a procedure
is bad, or can't be conceptual.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,815
As I said in the last class, most use of
procedures is conceptual.

6
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:21,140
And procedures are very important to
mathematics, when they're understood.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,204
It's really all about how you think you
can use them,

8
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:26,150
as I'll show you in a minute.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,760
So, the turkey problem is one that Ruth
Parker uses and

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,080
she's used it with parents a number of
times and,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,530
when she gives it to them, most of them
try to make use of the numbers.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,750
They try a quarter times a third, or a
quarter times three.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,241
Often realizing those answers don't make
sense.

14
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:48,950
Some try, and usually fail, to remember
how to set up the algebraic formula.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,590
But two fourth graders solved it in this
way.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,420
One of them said, if three slices is a
third, then nine slices is one pound.

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,340
And she can have nine quarters of a pound.

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,150
Another solved it visually like this.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,050
Another student also found out that there
were nine slices and

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,330
drew visually into quadrants to see those
two and a quarter slices.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,902
So the card problem, I hate problems like
this, and I love maths, but

22
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:25,778
there's something about them that makes me
so linguistically, heavy going and so

23
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:31,360
removed from the world for me, but anyway,
here's a way to solve it.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,630
See if this is what you did or similar.

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,230
So, the first thing we know is that
Charmaine and

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,670
Tesha each have a number of cards in the
ratio two to three.

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,940
So I'm going to draw up four spaces for
Charmaine and six for Tesha.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,330
So that is in the ratio 2 to 3.

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,950
We don't know that they have four and

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,360
six cards because that's a ratio that
we're representing, not the numbers.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,590
It could be that they have two and three,
four and six, 10 and 15.

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,850
We don't know at the moment.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,340
We also know that Tesha and Holly have a
number of cards in the ratio 2 to 1.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,840
So if my cards for Tesha look like this,
and the ratio is 2 to 1,

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,140
we're going to need half as many spaces in
our representation for Holly.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,336
Then it says if Tesha has four more cards
than Charmaine,

37
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,110
how many cards does Holly have?

38
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,696
That sounds very confusing, so

39
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:31,755
I am going to use some of information I've
got that helps me.

40
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,575
We know that Tesha has four more cards
than Charmaine and

41
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:40,100
I can see form the diagram that two spaces
show those extra four cards for Tesha.

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,943
So I realize now that all the spaces I
drew have two cards in them we need to

43
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:46,973
know how many cards Holly has.

44
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:52,280
So Holly has three spaces, so I'm going to
say that Holly has six cards.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,391
At this point, I would check that because
we know some things,

46
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:59,173
we know that Charmaine and Tesha have a
number of cards in the ratio 2 to 3, so

47
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:02,467
I can see that Charmaine now would have
two, four, six, eight, and

48
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:07,972
Tessa would have two, four, six, eight,
twelve.

49
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,459
So 8 to 12, is that in the ratio 2 to 3?

50
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,330
I think it is.

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,568
So what about the tough algebraic rate
problem, also a very unworldly problem and

52
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:21,110
the sort of problem that haunts students
for years.

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,078
We can really see the extent of the horror
around such problems,

54
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,522
by the way Hollywood uses them.

55
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,882
And in the movie Little Big League, a pre
teen boy is given the position of

56
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:34,160
managing the local baseball team when his
grandfather dies.

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,900
So he asks the team to solve the problem,
and it's kind of funny or

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,075
sad, I think, in the movie.

59
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:46,180
So first, what happens is there are just
lots of blank stares.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,260
Then the first person comes up and says
it's simple 5 times 3, so it's 15 hours.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,410
The next one says no it's eight hours,
it's 5 past 3.

62
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,334
Then another comes up and says there's two
of them so

63
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:03,470
it's 8 divided by 2 that's 4 hours.

64
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,185
One says why didn't they get a house
already painted?

65
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:10,080
Another says maybe it's a trick question
with no answer.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,170
I don't know.

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,830
8 sounds good to me.

68
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,679
Then this very confident man strides up
and says fellows, stand aside.

69
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:20,880
It's a plus b over a times b.

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,474
And he draws that and says it's 8 over 15.

71
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,678
This movie, as in so

72
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:31,920
many others, gives us a very negative
image of mathematics and maths learners.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,517
We see people working very unproductively,
just throwing out,

74
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:37,610
doing things with the numbers, putting
them together.

75
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,460
We see no mathematical reasoning at all.

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,660
So lots of procedural thinking.

77
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,809
And putting them two numbers together to
get anything which is sadly what a lot of

78
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:47,450
students will do.

79
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,090
Then we see, see somebody else provide a
formula as though by magic,

80
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,460
that others are mesmerized by with no idea
how it works.

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,599
So this is another way to solve the rate
problem.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,640
So I'm told that Jo takes three hours to
paint a house and Sam takes five hours.

83
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,810
And the question is how long will it take
if they paint it together?

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,770
So I'm going to look and think about that
for a bit.

85
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,929
I don't wannna move straight on.

86
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,864
And the first thing I'm going to probably
think about is,

87
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:20,430
somebody takes three hours, somebody takes
five.

88
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,439
Together they've got to take less than
three hours.

89
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,979
What I know is Jo, this is Jo's house,
paints that house in three hours, so

90
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,221
we're assuming she paints the constant
rate,

91
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:34,145
we're going to say she paints a third of
the house in one hour.

92
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:40,300
Sam takes five hours so Sam takes can
paint a fifth of the house in one hour.

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,524
So already we know together in one hour,
they're going to paint that third and

94
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:47,170
that fifth of the house.

95
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,070
We put that together and that makes eight
fifteenths.

96
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:57,530
So what we know now, is that in one hour
they paint eight fifteenths of a house.

97
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,100
But I want them to paint a whole house.

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,620
So I'm going to multiply both sides by 15
over 8.

99
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,304
And that's going to tell me that one house
with the two of

100
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:11,150
them takes 15/8 of an hour or one and
seven eighths of an hour.

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,230
And does that makes sense?

102
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,640
I have to think about that and yup.

103
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,230
I did think it would take less than three
hours.

104
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,670
So that sounds about right, just under two
hours.
