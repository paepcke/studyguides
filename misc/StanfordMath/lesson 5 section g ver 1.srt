1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,800
So now this is Kathy reflecting on that
number talk you just saw.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,509
So now we're going to look at a slightly
different number talk that was given to

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,000
third graders, and the teacher has adapted
the method somewhat.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,552
So the teacher is Nick Foot of Barron Park
School, and

5
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:18,070
he does a lot with number sense, as he
knows how important it is.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,490
And in this clip he's offered two problems
to the class.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,240
Then let them go and work in pairs or
threes.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,290
He gives them the choice, of which problem
to work on.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,025
Usually there's one easier and one harder.

10
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:36,480
And they record their strategies on an
iPad app called Doodle Class Pro.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,090
And you're going to see some of the
students,

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,070
first we'll have a look at some of the
students at work.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,303
So they've been given the two problems,
they've chosen one, and

14
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:49,910
they get to sit in twos and threes Working
and recording their methods.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,900
So after about 15 minutes of that work,
the students come together and

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,790
they share strategies and talk them
through.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,944
So Nick gets all the solutions on the
whiteboard using the reflector app, and

18
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:04,250
he projects them onto the whiteboard.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,214
And in the clip we're going to see he's
going through one of the harder

20
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,880
problems that he gave with the students.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,740
>> One, I want to say, good.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,292
Teamwork I could, right, work together,
took turns,

23
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,850
shared, tried to solve the problem.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,578
What I want to see is, I want to see if we
can do it together and then we'll take

25
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:26,292
a look at how, how you guys did it, okay,
to see if we come up with the same answer.

26
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,932
Quentin, so who can help me get started up
here.

27
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,021
Pavel, help me get started.

28
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,435
>> 8 times 3 is 24.

29
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:36,975
>> Okay.
So you said 8 times 3 is 24.

30
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:37,599
Okay.
Let's have it, 'cause I want to give

31
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,435
Miranda, it was Miranda's group, so
Miranda, from us

32
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,379
taking a second look here, she might see
something that they didn't see before.

33
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:40,882
>> So then.
>> Sure.

34
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:41,620
>> I would do,

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,784
I would split the 9 into 3 and 3.

36
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:45,449
>> okay.

37
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:50,016
>> And I would split the 24 into.

38
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:50,822
>> So.

39
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,299
>> 6 and 4.

40
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,080
>> 3 oop.

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,704
>> So 3 times 3, right.

42
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:58,038
>> So you saw this is that, right?

43
00:01:58,038 --> 00:02:02,500
>> Yeah, and then I split the 24 into six
and four.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,010
>> Okay.

45
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,155
So, I've got three and three, and then I
have, whoops.

46
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,136
>> Oh, that's right, I gotta go back here.

47
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:06,970
>> He used the pen.
>> My fault.

48
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,224
There we go.
Okay, so you said, so

49
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:14,195
now we've got six, four, three and three.

50
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:17,699
Okay, alright, we've taken the factors of
these numbers,

51
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,835
made them a little bit something.

52
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:23,628
Dinello, that has to be closed right now,
please.

53
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:24,610
Close it.

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,191
Okay, so what do we, where do.

55
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,495
>> Maybe you could do 4 times 3 to get 12.

56
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:33,374
>> Go ahead.
>> You do 4 times 3 to get 12.

57
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:36,040
>> Jeff has that.
Okay 4 times 3 gets 12.

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,141
Okay.
>> [CROSSTALK] You do 6 times 3.

59
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,875
>> And get 18.

60
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,821
18 times 12 [CROSSTALK].

61
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,555
>> So just [LAUGH].

62
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:48,890
>> So 6 times 3 equals 18.

63
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,832
>> So you're saying, okay, we.

64
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:58,104
>> Well, then, 18 times 12 equals, 216.

65
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,331
>> How'd you figure that out?

66
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:04,912
>> So if you go back to eight times, if
you go back to the start.

67
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:05,780
>> Okay.

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,230
>> Eight times

69
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,916
>> Start here
>> Eight times nine is 72.

70
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,588
>> Eight times nine equals 72.

71
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,608
Okay!

72
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:18,532
>> So time, so 70 times three equals 210.

73
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,206
>> 70 Shhh.

74
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:19,944
Oh, 70 times three is 210.

75
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:25,119
>> Then two times three

76
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:30,300
equals six.

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,128
So.
>> Two times three is six.

78
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,844
>> So 210 plus six equals 216.

79
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:39,368
>> 210 plus six equals.

80
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:41,416
216.

81
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,952
Okay.

82
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:46,070
Do we have enough, is there, do we see it
another way?

83
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,870
I'm just wondering.

84
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:57,010
So 8 times 9 times 3.

85
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,800
Jeremy, let's pass the mic to Jeremy.

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,050
Let's go ahead and have Jeremy.

87
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,520
Jeremy?
>> How do you see this one?

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,250
I think it's 24.

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,798
>> So what did you do?

90
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,710
Tell us what you did?

91
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,624
>> I like, the 8 times 3 equals 24.

92
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,352
>> Okay.

93
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,262
Great.

94
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:19,902
>> And then 9, and 9 is 33.

95
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:24,921
>> So you say that 9 is 3 and 3.

96
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,283
>> Okay.

97
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:32,410
>> And 24 times 3.

98
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,766
>> Okay.

99
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:39,801
>> 24 times 3 equals,

100
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:47,186
oh, 72.

101
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,182
>> Okay.

102
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:56,564
>> And 72 times 3 and n equals 216.

103
00:04:56,564 --> 00:05:00,722
>> 216.

104
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,638
Okay.

105
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:07,103
>> So question for you now, when I asked
the students in this class what they

106
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:11,560
thought about math, what do you think they
talked about?

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,140
So think a little bit about what they
might have told me math was.

108
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,560
[MUSIC]

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,984
