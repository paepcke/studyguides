1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,844
So the reason that tracking, setting,
often result in lower achievement in many,

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,985
and I'm going to go through some of the
things that I found from research.

3
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:11,333
So the first reason is the messages that
they give to students and

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,255
the first, this is a really big issue,

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:17,223
as the students go into ability groups
they develop more fixed mind sets,

6
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:25,390
more of an idea that they, they are or
they are not a math [INAUDIBLE] person.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,582
So in high groups, students get the idea
that they have the math gift,

8
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:31,290
a strongly fixed mindset message.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,760
And even fixed ideas that you're smart,
will hurt and limit brain group, growth.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,762
The kids in low groups, the fixed messages
are ones that stay with them for life, and

11
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:43,068
you can read about this in one of my
papers on psychological prisons,

12
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,446
which was one of the terms that the
students used,

13
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:51,080
when he was reflecting back on his school
experience.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,520
So, those messages are huge.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,712
And then, another huge piece is the
teacher expectations that go in

16
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:59,220
different ability groups, even when
teachers try or

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,560
don't want to have different [INAUDIBLE]
expectations.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,256
And those, what's now a really old study
which we wouldn't be able to

19
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:10,754
repeat these days but when researchers
gave all students in

20
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:15,176
an elementary school an IQ test, then they
randomly chose 20% of the students and

21
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,750
told the teacher that those students, by
name,

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,271
would be academic spurters that year and
they would move ahead.

23
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:29,363
And what they found was, at the end of
that year, those that randomly group,

24
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,389
groups, group of students achieved at
significantly higher levels than

25
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:38,807
the other students, with everything else
being the same.

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,080
And that just shows the huge importance of
teacher expectations.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,980
So the third reason is the work they’re
given.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,892
Students in lower groups are generally
given easier work, but

29
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,490
it’s often too easy and will limit their
achievement.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,460
They don’t even get access, even to the
higher level content that others do.

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,484
And for a long time in education we
thought it best to give students work that

32
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:02,254
they can get correct and feel good about.

33
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:03,502
But we now know that's wrong and

34
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:07,930
the prime goal it's all times must be that
students feel challenged.

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,362
Unfortunately, it's well-known that
students in groups from the second group

36
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,962
downwards get work that's insufficiently
challenging and

37
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:17,530
really denies them that learning
opportunity.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,840
And then one of the ones I talk about in
my book are the borderline causalities.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,480
It really seems to me that a decision that
is incorrect so much of the time about

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,120
which groups students go into, it may come
down to them not feeling very good on

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,990
the day of the test or whatever, can
determine a child's entire future.

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,650
And that really doesn't seem good.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,143
And then, the other reason that I found is
that in ability groups teacher tends to

44
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,985
teach in the middle of the group, they
assume that everybody is more or

45
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:51,264
less the same, because they've been
grouped together.

46
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,980
And everybody gets the same work at the
same pace.

47
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,960
Where as in mixed group,

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,250
teachers have to recognize that these
students are from all over the place.

49
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,058
And they have to give them different
opportunities to work and

50
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:05,298
what you find in those mixed groups, that
high achievers really take off

51
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:09,930
because they have opportunities to work at
their own level.

52
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:13,966
There are different ways of having
teachers give these

53
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:18,350
different opportunities to students in
different lessons.

54
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,390
They can use more open work or more
differentiated work.

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,634
You may remember in the Japanese lesson,

56
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:27,802
we watched the way the teacher gave
different options for

57
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:34,332
the students there's more detail about the
way those can work in my book.

58
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:37,962
But before I invite you to the forum, I
just wanted to share with you

59
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:44,027
some words from Michelle Obama, which I
recently saw that she spoke.

60
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:48,660
This is what she said to students at Savoy
Elementary School.

61
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,621
She said to them, "Because the truth is --
and

62
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:55,450
this is important; I want you all to
listen up -- no one is born smart.

63
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,180
Do you understand that?

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,400
No one is born smart.

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,930
No one is born knowing how to read, right?

66
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,686
No one is born knowing how to do math, no
one is born knowing how to

67
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:05,338
play the flute -- all of that comes with a
lot of hard work." And

68
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:10,230
she also talked about the importance of
mistakes and failure.

69
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,790
She told students about preparing for
greatness.

70
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,430
And you can,

71
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,750
there's a link to that speech if you want
to watch the First Lady's speech.

72
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,139
So I have a question that I want you to
discuss in the forum.

73
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,713
You may well teach in a school that has a
lot of ability grouping, most teachers do.

74
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,416
So I want to give you space now to react
to the research data and

75
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,238
ideas I've shared.

76
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,060
It'd be particularly great to hear from
people about things that are working well.

77
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,490
If you have stories around.

78
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,155
Ways of challenging all students maybe in
groups, maybe through detracking.

79
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:50,195
You may want to talk about conversations
you've had with administrators or

80
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:56,640
constraints you may face in moving to
these approaches.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,720
You may have had frustrations or things
you'd like to change in your schools.

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,700
So it's a very open question.

83
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,840
I'd like you to go to the forum.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,433
And if you have questions to ask,

85
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:10,080
there is a small group of us who are going
to try and answer questions.

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,984
So be, feel free to put down questions and

87
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:15,400
I just invite you to chat with your
colleagues in this course about some of

88
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,190
the ideas that I've shared around
grouping.
