1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,010
So, our summer school students were hugely
enthusiastic about the five weeks.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,940
And their two main reasons they gave were
collaboration and inquiry.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,165
Not because they were fun, but

4
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:15,850
because they apprciated that those two
aspects of the class helped them learn.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,819
So, here's just a few of the students
talking about that.

6
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:23,103
So in interviews in response to the
question did talking about math help you

7
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:25,220
and how?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,870
These are some responses from students one
of them said I used to

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,030
use only one way the teacher taught me and
not really understand it.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,060
Now, I use different ways until I can get
it.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,830
In normal school you don't get to do this
but it helped me understand things more.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,700
So, they're talking about talking.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,460
It helps me see how they see it and to see
if I could understand it.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,266
And when we can see the problems in
different ways,

15
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,010
we would understand it better.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,994
One of the great, most eloquent students
we interviewed was

17
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:56,010
a young African American girl who told us
it's like the way,

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,770
the way our schools did it is like, very
black and white.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,430
And the way people do it here, it's like,
very colorful, very bright.

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,270
You have very different varieties you're
looking at.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,512
You're can look at it one way turn your
head and

22
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:13,080
all of a sudden you see a whole different
picture, which is great.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,960
In response to a question on what really
helped you about the math's approach

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,310
the students talked about inquiring.

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,360
They talked about that concept of
generalization.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,050
So, here's one saying.

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,042
I've learned that after finding a patent
you can stretch it in many ways instead of

28
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,499
just staring at it.

29
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:30,043
I've learned to think beyond the answer to
the problem and

30
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:34,510
another one saying when I'm done I can
think of something harder to do.

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,060
These students refer to the fact that when
students who are faster finished a problem

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,360
we would ask them to extend it or

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,610
adapt the problem to make a new problem,
which they loved doing.

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,966
Another one saying generalizing helped me
to look beyond the problems and

35
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,310
make challenges for myself.

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,062
Patterns were very helpful because
sometimes the question was asking about

37
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,324
the huge numbers.

38
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,904
So, then I would just start with some
smaller numbers, find a pattern and

39
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,882
predict the answer without just taking a
lot of time and

40
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:00,480
effort to do the one big problem.

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,430
And this is one of the student's notebook
pages just reviewing the week before.

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,512
So, the summer school is a great
experience we saw huge change in

43
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:13,968
the students in engagement and in their
ways of approaching mathematics and

44
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,925
in algebraic understanding.

45
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:19,741
And one of them said to us at the end of
the summer if math was like this every day

46
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,390
I'd want to do it all day and all week.

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,854
In the fore we went to observe the
students back in their regular math

48
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,662
classes we went to 15 of them and in
everyone we saw them sitting in

49
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:34,230
rows working through worksheets solving
for x in silence.

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,450
So, these students what they had really
wanted in from that showed that they

51
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,250
learned from this intervention was to be
given hard challenges.

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,435
They actually really like to get the hard
work particularly the ones who are in

53
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,260
low tracks in their schools.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,020
They wanted to gain understanding through
discussion.

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,748
They want to be able to stretch problems
and

56
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:58,150
determine mathematical pathways, which is
the inquiry piece.

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,378
And, really, they want to add some color
to their mathematical landscapes and I'm

58
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:09,109
going to quote from the same student again
when we caught up with her in the fall.

59
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,074
And she reflected saying, I would say the
only way to describe summer school is

60
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:18,390
very colorful and then this class is just
still, ugh, black and white.

61
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,960
And you just want to ask can I have a
little bit of yellow?

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,930
So, I'm going to end this lesson just by
restating her plea,

63
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,660
to bring the color into algebra teaching.

64
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,135
To make it more inquiry based,

65
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,852
based on the core principles of algebra,
generalization, relationships,

66
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:37,059
exploration, not just on procedural
algebra.

67
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:39,019
And in the last session we're going to
bring together allot of

68
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,541
the different ideas we've learned in
different sessions, so.

69
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,703
Here are my principles again in case they
are useful for

70
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,970
you around the teaching of algebra.

71
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,870
And in the reference section there are a
lot of resources for

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,390
great algebra problems and tasks to use.

73
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,060
So, I'll look forward to seeing you next
session.
