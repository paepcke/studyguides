1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:08,881
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,817
So, there are very few research studies,
very, very few that I have read.

3
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,545
And then immediately thought the results
were so powerful, they needed to

4
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:19,070
be blasted from the rooftops, and
everybody should know about them.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,162
But here's one.

6
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:23,274
Two British professors, Eddie Grey and

7
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:28,230
David Tall, worked with 72 students
between the ages of seven and 13.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,818
And they had asked teachers to nominate
students they thought of as above average,

9
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:33,930
average and below average.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,440
They then gave the students various
addition and subtractions problem to do,

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,190
and they categorized their strategies.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,385
For example, they gave them problems such
as 7 plus 18,

13
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:49,900
which is the addition of a single digit
number to a teen digit number.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,740
As you can see here.

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,634
And what they found was that students used
four different strategies when they

16
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:57,970
worked on number problems.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,156
So their strategies were, some students
counted all.

18
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:05,310
So with 7 plus 18 they would say one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, one, two,

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,661
three, four, five and count up to 18.

20
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:12,012
And then to add them, they would count
them all again.

21
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:15,730
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten and go on like that.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,348
There's slightly more sophisticated
strategy of counting on is

23
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:24,500
when the students would add up to 7 or to
18 and then continue on.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,022
So if they added 18, they would then say
19, 20, 21.

25
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,910
Known facts, was when students just knew
what the the number bonds, they they just,

26
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,320
remembered them.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000
And what they called derived facts,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,441
which I would call number sentencing,
which this whole session was about.

29
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:46,146
Was when students were able to break
numbers apart and decompose and

30
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:49,136
add them and use them flexibly.

31
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:53,735
So for example, they might say with 8 plus
17, I'm going to make 8 plus 2 and

32
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,480
make that into 10.

33
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:04,240
And or they may break 17 into 15 plus 2,
and then calculate 15 and 2 and 8.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,150
So they make the problems into easier
addition problems.

35
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,140
And the results from age, the eight year
old's was stunning to me.

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,620
So the above average students 30% of them
knew their numbers they used facts,

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,515
known facts.

38
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:23,970
61% of them knew, used numbers sense, so
they used the numbers flexibly.

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,533
And 9% of them counted on.

40
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:31,041
In the below average group, 6% of them
used known facts,

41
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:39,675
none of them used number sense, 72% of
them counted on, and 22% counted all.

42
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,939
And when they worked with the ten year
olds, they found that the below average

43
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,070
group were using the same number of known
facts as the above average eight year old.

44
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,786
So, they're sort of caught up in the, the
number they remember over time.

45
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:55,300
But still, virtually no number sense.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,900
And instead, they were continuing to
count.

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,770
So, why is this finding so important?

48
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,180
The researchers who did this study put it
well.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,648
They concluded that the low achievers, so
often thought of as slow learners.

50
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,678
Were actually not working more slowly but

51
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:14,149
they were learning a different form of
mathematics.

52
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:17,249
And what's more, the mathematics that the
low achievers were learning was

53
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,870
the more difficult form of mathematics.

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,842
So let's think about this issue of the
more difficult mathematics with

55
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:25,720
the case of counting back.

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,560
Counting back is the strategy that young
children use when subtracting two numbers.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,470
So when you consider our problem such as
16 take away 13,

58
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:40,282
if you start at 16 and count down 13
numbers 16, 15, 14, 13, 12.

59
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:44,132
You'll find that this is actually an
extremely difficult task and

60
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:49,850
it has significant cognitive complexity
and enormous room for error.

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,325
By contrast, the strategy of the high
achievers.

62
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:59,905
Let's subtract 10 from 10 and 3 from 6,
which leaves 3 is much easier to use.

63
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:04,960
And those are the types of strategies that
high achieving students are able to use.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,417
So the fact that high achievers had
learned to act upon numbers flexibly.

65
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,682
And the low achieving students hadn't is
important, really important.

66
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,695
Because the flexible use of numbers and

67
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:19,430
shapes It's critical, to higher level
maths learning.

68
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,350
In fact, it's foundational for everything
that comes above.

69
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,820
All the higher level work in algebra,
calculus and beyond.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,570
So the problem for

71
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,111
low achieving children is not that they
cannot work in these ways.

72
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:36,690
But they haven't learned to engage with
maths in those ways.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,557
And the researchers found that when the
low achievers failed using their

74
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:40,957
counting methods.

75
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:44,750
They didn't change their method, but they
fell back into counting more and more.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,446
And the problem for those students comes
about because they may

77
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:53,021
become efficient with repeated counting of
small numbers.

78
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:55,661
And that lulls them into a sense of
security, and

79
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,665
they come to believe that maths is about
counting very precisely.

80
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,150
Unfortunately, as time goes on,

81
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,420
the low achieving students only have these
counting strategies.

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,215
And the counting gets ever more complex as
problems become more difficult.

83
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:15,460
And low achievers also, are often
identified as low achieving in school.

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,244
And the help that they, then often get is
more procedures.

85
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:24,868
More emphasis on doing procedures very
carefully rather than being taught to

86
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,350
use numbers flexibly.

87
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,940
And that's probably the very very last
thing that they need.

88
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,175
So, part of the seriousness of the problem
is this.

89
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,810
Mathematics is a conceptual subject.

90
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,480
It's not just a series of procedures and
methods.

91
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,795
Although many people think it is.

92
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:44,770
For example if we think of the hierarchy
of concepts in early number.

93
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,210
We know that students start by learning to
count and

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,720
that helps them to develop the concept of
sum.

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,745
Then they work on counting on and that
helps them to get the concept of addition.

96
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,124
And when they work with repeated addition,

97
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:05,170
that helps them develop the concept of a
product.

98
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,620
So when we learn mathematics,

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,570
we engage in a process in our brain that's
called compression.

100
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,870
And this is how it works,

101
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,535
when we learn new material, it takes up a
big space in our brain.

102
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,200
So, if I was to teach you some new
mathematics now,

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,631
you would be thinking about how it works.

104
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,684
Where it fits, how it fits with other
methods.

105
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:28,177
So it takes up a very large space.

106
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:34,800
But if I were, if you were to use some
early mathematics now such as addition.

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,560
You would probably just very quickly be
able to recall and use that.

108
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,284
That addition is not taking up a big space
in your brain, it's compressed.

109
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:48,620
And, this is William Thurston, he was a,
a, is field medal winner in mathematics.

110
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,875
And this is him talking about compression.

111
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:55,310
He said mathematics is amazingly
compressible.

112
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,964
You may struggle a long time, step by step
to work through the same process or

113
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,680
idea from several approaches.

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,584
But once you really understand it and have
the mental prespective to see it as

115
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:10,680
a whole, there's often a tremendous mental
compression.

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960
You can file it away.

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,830
Recall it quickly and completely when you
need it.

118
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,890
And use it as just one step in some other
mental process.

119
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,898
And the insight that goes with this
compression is one of

120
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,515
the real joys of mathematics.

121
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,370
But here's the problem.

122
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,190
Students who don't engage is conceptual
thinking don't benefit from compression.

123
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,050
So we can represent compression,

124
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,187
the compression that goes on in the brain
as a kind of triangle in this way.

125
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:44,600
With the space that's taken up with new
mathematics at the top of the triangle.

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,240
But for students who don't see mathematics
conceptually, for

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,170
them it's less of a triangle.

128
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,410
And more like an never ending ladder that
stretches up to the sky,

129
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,770
with method upon method upon method.

130
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,926
So their not thinking in mathematics
conceptually,

131
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:04,190
instead their thing there are lots, and
lots of different method s to remember.

132
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,610
And so their not engaging in this process
of compression.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,056
So, in mathematics education and policy
documents, people have, for

134
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:17,128
a long time, talked about procedural
methods and conceptual ideas.

135
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:20,320
Maths is made up of these two kind of
areas.

136
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,824
But the big divide between the two, so,

137
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:25,150
people talk about, it's either conceptual
or it's procedural.

138
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,893
But Caroline Kiran's done some really
interesting work, which has shown that.

139
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:33,675
Actually we need to use mathematics
conceptually even when we're just

140
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,685
learning procedures.

141
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:39,525
Because every time you need to use a
procedure, every time you need to adapt in

142
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:43,980
a, adapt a procedure, you engage in
conceptual thinking.

143
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,349
So those distinctions between the two are
probably not even that helpful.

144
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,800
So we have what people think of now as an
algebra crisis here in the U.S.

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,448
Everybody's worried that large numbers of
students are failing algebra and

146
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:03,164
that maybe algebra is just too difficult
or too hard.

147
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,957
But one of the main reasons students are
failing algebra is

148
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:09,180
a lack of foundational mathematics.

149
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,135
Particularly number sense.

150
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:15,023
So it's very difficult for students to
learn algebra if that,

151
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:20,542
that missed out on a foundational
understanding of early number.

152
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,160
And they've missed out on developing
number sense.

153
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,443
So, one of the people I interviewed from
this course, a very interesting person,

154
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,734
is Sebastian Thrun.

155
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,310
He's achieved many things.

156
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,110
He's a Stanford Professor, a Vice
President of Google, he is

157
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,040
the one who designed the self driving car,
and Google glass, and everything.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,862
So he's now the CEO of Udacity.

159
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:43,890
And I interviewed him about his use of
mathematics.

160
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,216
And I'm going to show you more of the
interview in the next session.

161
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:53,753
But he, when, when he reflects on his work
and talks about various things he's done.

162
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:58,037
But, one of the interesting parts was, he
talked about how everything he's done in

163
00:09:58,037 --> 00:10:02,422
his work including writing complex
mathematics papers.

164
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:07,360
And using a lot of high-level mathematics
comes down to an understanding of numbers.

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,690
He talks about addition in particular, and
how everything else falls into place.

166
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,595
So, this is a short extract that I'd like
you to watch and listen to now.

167
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,900
>> I think everyone writes exercises math
everyday, and and the way we operate.

168
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,970
We we think about time everyday, we think
about money,

169
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,345
we think about relationships of people.

170
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,870
How they interact with each other.

171
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,780
We think about tasks, about things we have
to do, about deadlines.

172
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,620
These are all mathematical examples.

173
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,772
And if we step a step further,

174
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,580
there's more contrived examples like
financing of your house and so one.

175
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,533
We live in more difficult to manipulate.

176
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:42,109
But even there, we can get an intuition
of, of what's going on and

177
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,410
they're mathematical.

178
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,980
I actually believe that more or everything
in, in math as addition.

179
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,001
Almost everything can be derived to very,
very simple operations by

180
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:54,080
putting numbers together is the core of,
of all the mathematics.

181
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Things I've written a fairly up-straight
math book full of formulas and

182
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,020
formulas and formulas.

183
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,933
I think you would, like your head would
smoke seeing all the formulas.

184
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,270
And still everything in there is just
basically addition.

185
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,652
So, I think the key thing is not to be
afraid of the formulas.

186
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,090
The formulas are just a language.

187
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,302
The key thing is to grasp the concepts and
understand where they apply.

188
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:16,014
The key thing is to understand that
certain rules apply regardless of

189
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:17,640
the context.

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,490
For example, adding apples is the same as
adding pears.

191
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,440
And once this abstraction is done between
an Insensation of

192
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
a concept that might involve time or space
or people.

193
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,532
To another Insensation, you already have
the basic math skill,

194
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:31,492
that just [INAUDIBLE] to abstract.

195
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,590
[INAUDIBLE] that there's rules that
transcend beyond a certain domain.

196
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,280
And simple rules are very powerful;
complicated rules are not very powerful.

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,770
They are simple rules.

198
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,475
So rules that say,

199
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,976
we can add numbers and we can keep track
with them with them more.

200
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:47,196
There some sort of coincidency to certain
things like the, the way space evolves and

201
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,278
so on, are really powerful.

202
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:55,278
>> So, what I'd like you to do now is
think a bit about what we've seen,

203
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:03,181
so far and what you've heard and answer
this question.
