1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,464
So in the Cathy video we watched,

2
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:05,255
we saw a task that could definitely be all
about performance.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,960
One divided by 2 3rd, if that 2 3rds, if
that was given to students as a question,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,700
definitely they could just see that as one
quick answer that they meant to show.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,445
But Cathy transformed that task by asking
students about different ways they

6
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:25,145
could make sense of 1 divided by 2 3rds,
and that opened it up.

7
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:25,890
You know?

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,487
Along with the culture of her class, it's
all about learning and

9
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,220
explore, and exploring.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,750
And that opening encouraged opportunities
for a growth mindset.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,674
So at Stanford, we've been collecting good
resources for

12
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,650
tasks at different grade level.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,390
And I've put Alice into the Wiki section,
and it's an ongoing process.

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,867
We are constantly looking and adding to
it, but if you have task or

15
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:54,882
resources such as book references that you
think are really great.

16
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:56,122
Or it might be web pages,

17
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:01,170
please put it under the Wiki section that
will be there headed, Great Task.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,590
And then, at the end of the class we can
send out the stats to everyone.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,154
[MUSIC].

20
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:10,634
So the third section I want to talk about
is something very important which is

21
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:15,890
the way you assess and grade and give
feedback to students.

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,880
That's a really important place for the
encouragement of a great mindset.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,526
For many students, they receive multiple
choice tests, or

24
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:28,745
closed questions, that tell them how well
they're doing or how badly they're doing.

25
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,800
Compared to others, usually.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,630
But really give them no information about
the path for growth and improvement.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,110
So, two professors in the UK, Paul Black,
who is my PhD adviser, and Dylan William.

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,709
To get to the master analysis of all the
studies that have taken place on

29
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:50,930
what sometimes called formative assessment
or assessment for learning.

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,280
So, the difference between formative and
summative assessment is Summative is

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,335
an end of unit assessment that shows
performance.

32
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:01,427
Formative assessment in this, is an
assessment that informs learning for

33
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:04,370
the student and the teacher.

34
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,180
And can also used be used summatively.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,927
But from the meto analysis of studies that
looked at the impact of assessment for

36
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,010
learning.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,920
Black and William found that if scores
were to use that more often.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,820
It would raise the ranking of a country
such as the US.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,644
Which sits in the middle of the pack and

40
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:23,090
international assessments to a place in
the top 5.

41
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,960
So really, that one change could have a
massive impact on the way students learn.

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,020
So assessment for learning is based on the
principle that students have a full and

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,865
clear sense of where they are going, and
what, and

44
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:37,580
what they have to do to be successful.

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,276
That may sound obvious but I’ve found that
students in math classes rarely know

46
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:44,228
where they are in their learning path.

47
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:47,270
Either what they’re learning beyond the
chapter title.

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,942
Sometimes I go to students in math classes
and

49
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:53,380
I say, Oh, tell me what you’re working on,
and they’ll say, Oh, chapter three.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,810
And I'll say, oh, so what are you working
on exactly?

51
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,901
And they'll say, oh, I'm sorry, question
four and

52
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,790
they really can't tell me more than that.

53
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,330
So assessment for learning is about how we
should know where they are and

54
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,140
also how they can be successful.

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,680
So it's really about communicating three
things, where students are,

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,430
where they need to be , and a way to close
the gap between the two.

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,706
Most students in math classrooms really
get nothing from an assessment result

58
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:21,522
other than a rank or

59
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:25,720
an evaluative statement about where they
are compared to others.

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,870
Like, a grade such as B or D.

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,928
That information for students,
particularly for

62
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:34,180
those who are getting D's and are under
performing.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,360
Is really damaging for them as it's a
constant knocking their self esteem.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,136
So a really interesting experimental study
was conducted by Butler, and

65
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,630
he compared three conditions.

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,099
Well first of all he compared just two
conditions, he gave students grades.

67
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,340
And then in the other condition they gave
students diagnostic feedback.

68
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,740
And what they found was the students who
had no grades, but

69
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,780
they got diagnostic feedback did
significantly better in the future.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,520
Then they added a third group and they
said, Oh, why don't we give them both?

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,952
So they gave grades, grades and feedback
and just feedback and

72
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:11,600
they found, that again, it was the
students who only got feedback.

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,715
Who outperform the others and those who
got grades and

74
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,588
feedback did the same as those who just
got grades.

75
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:20,400
Because it turned out that once you give a
grade, the student just looks at that.

76
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:25,969
They thought it might be the best of both
worlds to get both.

77
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,506
But they found that the very best thing
you can do for

78
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:33,077
students is to ditch the grade and give
them diagnostic feedback.

79
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:36,690
And that feedback, helps them understand
how they can improve.

80
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,480
So assessment for learning makes use of
diagnostic feedback.

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,642
And its main focus is on helping students
become aware of where they are and

82
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:48,470
where they should be in ways that help
them bridge the gap.

83
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,970
And that awareness is often built through
self and peer assessment.

84
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,551
Teachers set mathematical goals for

85
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:57,337
students, not list of chapter titles or
contents.

86
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:00,419
But, details of the important ideas and
how they are linked.

87
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,765
And they can be given a statement, sort of
very clear and

88
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:06,430
communicate the point of the work that
they are working on.

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,623
For example the students could have the
statement,

90
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,224
I have understood the difference between
mean and median and

91
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:14,420
know when they should be used.

92
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,750
Very clearly tells them the point of that
lesson or piece of work.

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,435
The students then assess their, or their
peers, work against the statements.

94
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:25,130
And as time goes on, something really
important happens.

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,730
Students start to take more responsibility
for their learning as they become aware of

96
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,420
what they should be learning, and what the
important ideas are.

97
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,054
And in studies of self-assessment in
action,

98
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:39,050
researchers have found students are very
perceptive about their own understandings.

99
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,710
And they don't over or underestimate it.

100
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,156
So a question for

101
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:48,869
you now, think of some key things in maths
that people need to work on.

102
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,419
Could be for a future class of yours or

103
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,840
something that your children work on at
home.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,660
And think of a way of writing one or

105
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,000
two statements to show students what's
important to know.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,245
For example, if I was teaching students
through area models to

107
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:07,830
understand fractions, I might give them
this statement.

108
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,856
I understand that fractional parts of a
whole always have to be equal in size but

109
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:13,715
not in shape.

110
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,959
And that would be a statement that they
could take and

111
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,900
think about how well they've understood
that.
