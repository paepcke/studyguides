1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,020
So we're going to be talking about all of
these ideas in the sessions that follow.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,723
Now the data I've just shown you is about
a serious crisis, but

3
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:12,780
in one very large section of the US
population, but it doesn't end there.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,308
That's a crisis for students in two year
colleges there are students that don't get

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:21,170
into two year colleges, and for them, the
problem are probably worse.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,485
And then the four year college system.

7
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:28,070
We also have plenty of students who are
really harmed by mathematics.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,020
I released this book for parents and

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,740
the public a couple of years ago, with a
US version and a version for the UK.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,888
And this prob, that book took me on a
journey that I hadn't been before,

11
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:46,480
during which I met a huge number of highly
professional and educated people.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
Many of them women, who were absolutely
terrified of maths.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,866
Now I've always known that far too many
people have a terrible time with math.

14
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,404
But these people really showed me the
depth of trauma and

15
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:59,830
the severity of the reaction.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,016
So when that book came out I was in feed
on about 40 different radio

17
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:07,266
stations across the U.S and BBC stations
across the UK.

18
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:11,268
And the presenters almost all of them
shared with me

19
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:14,710
their own stories of trauma.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,570
It was kind of interesting.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,275
I I was introduced as this mathematics
education professor, but early on I

22
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:24,400
said that I know that mathematics is very
traumatic for lots of people.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,468
And as soon as I said that the session,
the interviewers we opened up and

24
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,773
the sessions became more like therapy
sessions.

25
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:34,552
As these different people shared their
tales of trauma.

26
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,400
So we're going to listen to one of them
from the US.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,003
This was Kitty Dunne reporting on
Wisconsin Radio.

28
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:46,410
>> Well why is it that, why is math such a
scarring experience for so many people?

29
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,830
Is it something about the people who are
into math, just, aren't, they're, maybe,

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,840
just, don't know that much about teaching,
and engaging kids?

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,260
Because it's two sides of the brain?

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,760
Or what, what's going on there, that, that
happens?

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,532
I mean, for me, I mean, I still remember
the name of the author of my algebra book,

34
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:05,046
because it's, like burned into my head.

35
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:05,964
>> Oh dear.

36
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,470
>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] You know what I mean?

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:07,993
>> Yeah.

38
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,733
>> And so, I, I guess, I don't know, how,

39
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,678
why is it that there are a lot of great
English teachers.

40
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:17,870
You don't hear of a too many kids with
scarring English class experience.

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,610
>> No, that's right.

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,586
I mean, math really plays a unique roll in
our children's lifetimes and

43
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:24,750
being that subject that can crush their
confidence.

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,012
So what was notable to me was really how
much it had hurt people what a kind of

45
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:35,210
scarring experience it was for them.

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,459
But in case you think, well journalists
and reporters are kind of

47
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,547
artsy media types I want to introduce you
now to an amazing woman.

48
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:44,963
Called Vivienne Parry, OBE,

49
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:49,950
that's Order of the British Empire, a
medal that is given to you by the Queen.

50
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,760
And she's a pretty incredible person.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
She's a scientist, a top scientist.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,500
She's Vice chair of counsil for University
College of London.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,480
Member of the Medical Research Council.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,140
She presents BBC TV science programs, and
she's author of, several books.

55
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,260
So I asked Vivian to introduce me, when I
gave a talk at the Royal Institution in

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,110
London a couple of years ago.

57
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,575
This is a picture of the Royal
Institution.

58
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:18,080
We're going to listen now to Vivienne's
introduction of me in that talk.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,082
>> Well the reason that I think I'm here
telling this is

60
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:28,595
because I did a program for radio for
about Dyscalculia.

61
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:32,564
And have myself tested, and was shammingly
bad at maths and

62
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:39,980
a couple of two or three weeks ago Lenny
Henry and I did a program together.

63
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,784
Where we talked about our awful, awful
maths experiences at schools.

64
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:49,528
And when I did this program, I said that I
was reduced to

65
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:56,706
sobbing in the corner because Mrs Glass,
my math teacher made me stand there.

66
00:03:56,706 --> 00:04:00,060
Because I couldn't do my seven times
table.

67
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,948
And do you know, five women called the BBC
Action Line and

68
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:10,499
said was it Mrs.Glass of Rookesbury Park?

69
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,723
[LAUGH] , [SOUND].

70
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:15,764
And you know ladies and gentlemen, it
surely was.

71
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:16,424
[LAUGH].

72
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:23,516
And ever since then, one of the things
that we, were both saying was that.

73
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:27,862
We always thought that people who could do
maths were clever, so

74
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:31,710
that if you couldn't do maths.

75
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,331
It must mean that you weren't clever, and
both Lenny Henry and

76
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:39,997
I have this secret shame, well not with my
secret.

77
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:44,169
All our lives about being bad at maths,
and I was always afraid that Mrs.

78
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,380
Glass would jump out.

79
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,002
When I was at the BBC, tap me on the
shoulder and

80
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:55,220
say that's it Parry, you've had your lot,
we've discovered you.

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,440
So, math really, has an enormous effect,
on children's lives.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,090
And it can, bad teaching can, blight their
lives.

83
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,228
So, I am delighted to introduce Professor
Joe Bo.

84
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:14,458
>> So this is Vivian describing maths in
her life.

85
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,988
She says, This has pursued me through my
whole life.

86
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:20,562
It's so undermining of your whole being to
be so

87
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:23,743
bad at maths, you just feel so stupid.

88
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:28,163
So here's this top scientist who feels so
awful about her maths relationship,

89
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:34,330
she told me that even if she was getting a
medal, her OBE from the Queen.

90
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,411
She was worrying, because I'm not good at
maths, I'm an impostor.

91
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,379
So this fear and trauma with maths is very
damaging, it's very widespread and

92
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,790
it cuts across achievement levels and
success levels in the population.

93
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,493
You may yourself have this sort of
relationship with maths, and

94
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:54,028
if you do I hope this course will really
help with that.

95
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:56,368
So I'm going to ask you a question now,
which is,

96
00:05:56,368 --> 00:06:02,090
how surprised are you by the information
and data I have just presented?

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,586
How does this connect, if at all, with
your own students or

98
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,250
your own reason for taking this course?

99
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,680
So this is the first time of many that you
are going to be asked to write a response.

100
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,830
This time it's just for me and the other
teaching assistants to read.

101
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,330
Sometimes it will be seen by others, but
I'll tell you about those times.
