1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,395
So, we're going to listen now,

2
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:05,590
to three of the boys in Nick's class that
I caught up with after the number talk.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,070
So, the first question that I asked them
that you'll see them respond to,

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,494
is what they think of math?

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,684
So, if you can get past their cuteness, I
want you to think about and

6
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:19,970
discuss afterwards, what surprised you or
interested you in what they said?

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,983
>> So do you guys like math?

8
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:22,534
>> Yes.
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:23,370
>> Yes.
>> What about you?

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,399
What's your favorite math thing to do?

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,813
>> I like the composing and adding.

12
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:33,412
>> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

13
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:34,470
What's, what are friendly numbers?

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,878
>> A tiny number.

15
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:36,902
>> [CROSSTALK] Ten to five.

16
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:41,254
>> A friendly number is like when you add
five.

17
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:45,734
Like for example, five times five plus
four plus seven.

18
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:46,630
>> Uh-huh.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,574
>> Ten is a really friendly number.

20
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:50,342
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,793
>> So, you, and five plus five equals ten.

22
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:54,675
>> Right.

23
00:00:54,675 --> 00:01:01,438
>> So you know, so you put the ten and
then you just add four plus 11.

24
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,634
>> I see.

25
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:04,821
>> Which equals 21.

26
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,680
>> Uh-huh, cool.

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,697
What do you think about the talking about
math part.

28
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,614
Do you think that helps you understand?

29
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,097
>> It does.

30
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:20,101
>> [INAUDIBLE] It's like, it does and
doesn't.

31
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,700
>> Uh-huh.

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,785
Tell me about why it does at first, or you
tell me.

33
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:25,820
Anyone.

34
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,722
>> It actually does, because you can see
what other people do, compared to yours.

35
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,906
>> Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,493
>> See how other people would do it.

37
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:33,641
[CROSSTALK].

38
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,499
>> And well you can see what other people
think and

39
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,520
then you can tell what you think.

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,250
>> Mm-hm.

41
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,050
>> There was also, sometimes we make
mistakes, but

42
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,580
everybody makes mistakes, so [INAUDIBLE].

43
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,860
>> That's right.

44
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,675
>> You'll be able to see where you made a
mistake too, if you made one.

45
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:54,710
>> And mistakes are great, because you can
learn from mistakes; we all make mistakes.

46
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,570
>> Yeah.
>> Do you feel okay if you're doing in

47
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,190
a math talk and you make a mistake?

48
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,630
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, pretty much.

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,015
>> because if like they, they just like
help us out and then tell us Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,086
>> They help us with the answers.

51
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:07,121
>> That's right.

52
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:08,885
>> [CROSSTALK] have to do more math work.

53
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:09,478
[LAUGH].

54
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:13,828
>> So do you think math is subject where
you're always following rules or

55
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:18,750
is it a subject where you get to think
about ideas?

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,942
>> I think it's like you can think about
different things at one time to

57
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,016
make one thing work.

58
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:25,341
>> It's like it, it's you're free.

59
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:27,940
You can do whatever you want like breaking
down.

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,822
>> You can pause.

61
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,090
>> You can do what you want to get an
answer.

62
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,745
[CROSSTALK].
>> You can make [UNKNOWN] numbers,

63
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:35,122
you can, like, breaking down into
multiplications.

64
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,158
>> Uh-huh, so there's math talks, like,
you do all those things then?

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,446
>> Yeah, yeah.

66
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,798
>> Did you use math in those ways before
with class, or

67
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:46,396
did you break it down and do all those
different things [CROSSTALK].

68
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:47,031
>> No.
>> No.

69
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:47,856
>> Not at all.

70
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:53,359
>> So what did you, what did you, how is
it different?

71
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,168
>> Well it's like, Nick teaches us like
how to break it down,

72
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,794
like use multiplication problems.

73
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:02,312
So it's like easier to like make friendly
numbers.

74
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,147
Like decomposing and all that stuff.

75
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:05,215
>> Uh-huh.

76
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,297
So does that help you solve math problems
being able to break down the numbers and

77
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,135
make friendly numbers?

78
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:10,968
>> A lot.

79
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:15,144
>> Also it's different too at the same
time because you don't normally do

80
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:18,249
that until third grade, so.

81
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,570
>> Mm-hm, so do you think, now you've
learned to do that.

82
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,698
Do you think you can do that in other math
problems that you get even when you're not

83
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,422
in the math course?

84
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:29,868
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, if Nick didn't teach us this we

85
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:37,753
would be like, what is this in the fourth
grade?

86
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:38,834
[MUSIC].
