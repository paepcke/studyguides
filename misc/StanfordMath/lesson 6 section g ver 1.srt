1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,436
Emily tells us that curiosity is what
separates an okay engineer from

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:07,250
a good engineer.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,666
Sebastian tells us that his intuitive
approach to math has allowed him to

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:15,450
make these great discoveries and
breakthroughs he's made.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,466
And it may be, it may well be whats needed
for

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:22,181
students as well to do well in the new
Common Core Assessments in the US.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,782
But the problem is, the focus and

8
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:27,246
the policies and the testing in math's
education for

9
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:33,230
decades, have completely ignored that
relationship as though it doesn't exist.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,360
And focused only on the knowledge that
should be crammed into student's heads.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,246
And that process of cramming too much
knowledge,

12
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:43,370
has really stopped students developing
that critical relationship.

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,160
In some cases, it's killed the
relationship students entered school with

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,910
or entered the class with.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,060
So what are the important pieces?

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,060
I want to unpack this inquiry relationship
a bit.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,786
Intuition is really important and it's
been studied and

18
00:00:56,786 --> 00:01:02,420
considered by mathematicians and
philosophers and others over centuries.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,364
Leone Burton interviewed 70 research
mathematicians to find out how

20
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:12,020
they worked, and her main finding was the
huge role played by intuition.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,500
And 83% of her mathematicians embraced
that and

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,950
talked about it's essential role in their
work.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,721
But most students in math classrooms don't
think intuition is allowed or

24
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:27,060
appropriate when they work on math
problems.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,788
It's [INAUDIBLE] intuition, I think,

26
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:32,353
is a little related to having a feel for
numbers.

27
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:36,135
And that ability to sort of feel where you
are in a problem is also rare or

28
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:39,840
absent in a lot of today's math learners.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,890
Reuben Hersh wrote a great book called
what is mathematics really?

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,199
And in math, he says,

31
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:50,600
if we look at mathematical practice, the
intuitive is everywhere.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,533
So intuition is one part of that
productive inquiry relationship we

33
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,209
hope that learners develop.

34
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:01,820
Sebastian talks about solving a problem
intuitively, then going back to work it

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,260
out mathematically and over a period of
two weeks.

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,811
But it was his intuitive insight that
allowed the researchers to move forward in

37
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:13,180
the problem they were having with robots
getting interfering data.

38
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,685
Let's think about something else.

39
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:17,780
Curiosity.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,970
That's a really big idea.

41
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,540
It's something that's great.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,370
Everybody knows how important it is.

43
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,855
Everyone knows it's valuable.

44
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,556
But how many of you, I wonder, as teachers
and

45
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:33,140
parents, see mathematical curiosity in
your students.

46
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,780
So I'm going to ask you a bit, a bit like,
a survey question now just to rate that.

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,244
So, how often are your children, students,
mathematically curious?

48
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:42,785
[MUSIC].
