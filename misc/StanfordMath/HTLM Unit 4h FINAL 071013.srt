1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,259
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,202
So the fourth section I want to talk about
is the way we group students in schools.

3
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:13,502
Earlier this year in Denver, Colorado, I
asked 800 teachers and teacher leaders.

4
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:14,906
You may have been there.

5
00:00:14,906 --> 00:00:19,000
How they thought students received fixed
mindset messages in schools?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,580
Where do they come from?

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,544
And the number one reason chosen, which I
agree with, was the ability

8
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:27,730
grouping that's used in schools, whether
we call it tracks or sets.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,158
And I think that's right.

10
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:32,560
The biggest fixed mind set message we give
to kids is to tell them you're low,

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,734
high, or middle ability.

12
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,034
In England, many students don't just think
of themselves as low or

13
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,994
high, they think of themselves as a number
and students will tell each other and

14
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:47,310
parents, I'm a level four, or even worse,
I'm a nothing.

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,855
There's a paper written about that in the
reference section.

16
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:56,054
Now not many countries are, are as extreme
as that in the labeling.

17
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:59,128
But whenever or however ability grouping
happens to students,

18
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,800
whether they're grouped within or across
classes.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,350
They start to develop fixed ideas about
their potential, and

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,170
those fixed ideas don't normally stop at
math.

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,400
In my daughter's school in England,

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,360
they used to put students into ability
groups at age 5 for maths.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,060
And the kids came home after that happened
saying, oh,

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,260
all the clever children have gone into a
different group now.

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,920
So they get ideas about each other's
ability,

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,050
not just about their math potential.

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,920
They get very fixed messages about their
intelligence.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,144
So one of the main messages we get from
the brain and the mindset research is

29
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:38,850
that when students think they're in a low
group, everything begins to unravel.

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,330
Even kids in top groups get fixed mind set
messages.

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,050
You're the smart ones, and that's damaging
for them.

32
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,290
It may feel good for a while but it will
hold them up in their later work.

33
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,440
As students with a fixed mind set just
can't learn as well as we've seen.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,210
Now, intuitively I think it makes a lot of
sense to group students according to

35
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,980
notions of ability or what they know at
that time.

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,060
Teachers can target material to students
more accurately, and that seems good.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,725
But let's look at the evidence because
there's really been a lot of evidence on

38
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,600
this topic.

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,428
And what we know is, the countries that
group students by ability, the least and

40
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:22,240
the latest are the most successful in the
world, Finland, Japan, lots of countries.

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
When teachers in England put students into
ability groups,

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,324
researchers found that one-third of the
children were put into the wrong group,

43
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:31,330
even just looking at achievement.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,558
We also know that about 88% of students
put into groups at ages four and

45
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:40,400
five stay in those groups for the rest of
their school career.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,624
And in very careful experimental studies
of students who go through tracked or

47
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:48,080
mixed achievement groups the studies find
no advantages and

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,610
significant disadvantages for students in
tracks and sets.

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,770
So let's look at a couple of those
studies.

50
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,870
The first one was conducted in the US by
Carol Burris, Jay Heubert, and Hank Levin.

51
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,798
So in that study they followed students
over three years when they were in

52
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,390
tracks in middle school and then they, the
schools untracked and

53
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,604
they continued to follow students for the
next three years.

54
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:15,349
And when they were doing that, all of the
students were

55
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:19,550
taking the highest level work in those
untracked classes.

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,306
And what they found was the untracked
students achieved more,

57
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,949
they took more advanced courses, and

58
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,606
they passed the state exams a year earlier
then the students who worked the tracks,

59
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:32,380
and those advantages were across the
achievement range.

60
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,690
In England, researchers followed 14,000
children through years four and six.

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,434
Comparing those taught in sets with those
grouped heterogeneously over the period of

62
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:43,480
a year.

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,262
And those taught in sets, or tracks,
scored at lower levels on tests of

64
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:51,270
reasoning, and again that came from
across.

65
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,514
The achievement range and the references
for those, that is,

66
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,328
in the reference section.

67
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:59,783
And then, finally, the National Research
Counsel in the U.S.,

68
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:04,720
has made a number of reports about
tracking.

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,633
They recently reported with the Institute
of Medicine.

70
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,339
They gave a report that concluded both
formal and

71
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:14,390
informal tracking viability be eliminated.

72
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,130
And alternative strategies should be used
to ensure appropriately challenging

73
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,170
instruction for students who vary widely
in their skill levels.

74
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,822
So studies that are more in depth have
also been conducted,

75
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:29,846
I've conducted them and others, where
students are being followed through

76
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:33,880
grouping systems over years, different
grouping systems.

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,345
And they produce exactly the same as human
results, with higher results for

78
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:41,749
students in mixed groups, but they also
show more why that happens.

79
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:45,370
So I want to pause for a moment and ask
you the question.

80
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:50,742
Why do you think tracking / setting,
results in lower overall achievement for

81
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:54,030
students in these different studies?
