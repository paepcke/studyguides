1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,298
So in this first part of the class, we've
explored what it means to think and

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:06,170
problem solve conceptually.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,482
For the second part, I want to work on
something just as important.

4
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:12,332
And that is,

5
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:19,465
I want to think about what it means to
build an inquiry relationship with maths.

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,025
[MUSIC].

7
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:23,325
So I'd like now to show you some
interviews with five people who use

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,558
mathematics, including some very high
level math users.

9
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,852
And in my view, they're saying something
really important that I

10
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:35,710
want us to think hard about and focus on
in this session.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,300
Please give them your full attention,
maybe take a break between each one.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,562
They're really interesting.

13
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:44,786
And after each one, you're going to be
prompted to write down the main ideas that

14
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:48,800
they're saying just in a few different
words.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,930
You can make it into a concept map, or you
can just list it.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,802
But what were the big ideas that they gave
you or

17
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:57,935
what were the big ideas that they talked
about and the smaller ideas, too.

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:01,169
>> Given, you know, how you think you use
math in your work, and

19
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,750
how lots of issues math.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,380
I guess, if you were to help teachers
design courses that would be useful for

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,800
people when they're going into the
workplace, what,

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,035
what do you think would be important to,
what would be the emphasis?

23
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:20,000
>> I mean I believe that kids need to
master the basics.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,886
But after that I think for me,
project-based or

25
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:25,846
practical examples are the best way to
learn and

26
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:31,026
reinforce material because that again,
that's how I learned the math that I use,

27
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:37,965
is by seeing patients and going through
real life examples.

28
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,720
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,852
>> For me, that's what I remember better
than if I'm sitting down and

30
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,528
trying to memorize something from, from a
page that I'm reading.

31
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:47,612
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:50,204
>> So I would be trying to incorporate
that more.

33
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,668
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:54,944
>> Did you have that much in your math,
teaching?

35
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,888
>> I mean.
It was,

36
00:01:55,888 --> 00:02:02,130
you know it was abysmal [LAUGH] where I
went to school.

37
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,601
There was nothing progressive about it and

38
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:10,755
it was very traditional and [INAUDIBLE]
and dull.

39
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,428
>> You didn't enjoy it in school.

40
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,390
>> Mm-hm.

41
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,800
I liked calculus was the first time I
enjoyed math.

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,375
>> Interesting.

43
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,415
>> Well, calculus is more conceptual.

44
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:21,249
>> Um-hm.
It was the first time I didn't feel

45
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:25,730
terrible about my mathematical abilities.

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,640
I always felt, I always felt I was bad at
math.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,832
When I was thinking about answering
questions about how I use math,

48
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:36,410
at first I was having trouble thinking of
examples outside of work.

49
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,521
>> But When I probe deeper I, I realized
the reason I was having trouble using

50
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:43,928
examples is because I'm using it but, not,
I don't consider it math.

51
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,795
>> Mm-hm.
>> And it's so interesting to me, so

52
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:49,095
an example is, a couple days ago I ordered
a desk for a, for, the study, and

53
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:52,395
I realized, you know, I was measuring the
space, you know, the height and

54
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,570
length and width.

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,413
And then I went online and I want, I had
to see which of the desk would fit or,

56
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:04,420
you know even loading the dishwasher,
you're using geometry.

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,160
Or, you so, I mean, it was kind of once it
clicked I realized it's everywhere.

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,810
And so I was explaining this to my
daughter during dinner and

59
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,790
she, you know she, it, I think she really
understood finally.

60
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,045
She and I said we're using math all the
time without realizing it.

61
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:20,292
It becomes intuitive.

62
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:20,801
>> Right.

63
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,920
>> We don't consider it math.

64
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,970
I think the reason we don't consider it
math is we view math as

65
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,432
something that's either hard or very
formal or structured.

66
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:30,124
>> Mm-hm.

67
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:30,750
>> Right.

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,752
So it's just a problem in our perception.

69
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,059
>> Right.
>> So if it's not hard or formal or

70
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,062
structured we're not saying it's math.

71
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,513
>> Yeah.
>> But the truth is we're using it

72
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,939
all the time.

73
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,830
Even you know estimating, you know like,
make, having my kids share things so

74
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,350
I'm dividing up portions all the time and
seeing, you know is this equal.

75
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,620
All kinds of ways.

76
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,269
You, you know, even things like, driving.

77
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,110
>> Yeah.
>> I think we all do this.

78
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,238
We're estimating how long is it going to
take us to get to the school and

79
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,938
I need to leave at this time.

80
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:01,319
>> Right.
>> Oh, but I have to stop and

81
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,451
pick this kid up, so my whole carpool
schedule and

82
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,155
all the things I do outside of my job that
are just with my kids or

83
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:11,040
household, there's so much math you don't
even realize it.

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,992
[MUSIC]

85
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:21,813
>> I'm a software engineer at Udacity.

86
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:26,875
Udacity's a education startup for online
kind of learning platform.

87
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,570
>> Mm-hm.

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,200
And, how about if

89
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,175
you just start by describing what you do
in your current job.

90
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,250
>> Sure.
So, I'm a software engineer.

91
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,122
I work with a team of people.

92
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:41,602
I mainly focus, at the moment on analytics
so we're analyzing the performance of

93
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:46,426
our course content and also the
performance of students.

94
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:50,250
And it's a problem that really never has
been solved before.

95
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,140
And so I work, you know day to day on,
something that I don't know how to solve.

96
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,684
And you know, then it's coming up with
different ideas and

97
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:01,182
testing things and we got a lot to learn
about, things like data science, and

98
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:05,190
a lot to learn about handling huge data
sets.

99
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,942
>> so, a lot of innovation that we're
trying to work through.

100
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,222
>> Mm-hm.
>> But you know an IMP,

101
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:13,826
you know you're presented with a problem
that you didn't know anything about, and

102
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:17,059
you worked together to find your own
vernacular that you could share with

103
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,110
each other.

104
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,748
And then, and

105
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:25,740
then that vernacular would be evolved to
be the one that's more commonly accepted.

106
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,290
But that was yours, it's not something
that people gave, you know gave to you.

107
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,340
You developed it.

108
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,680
You own it and call it whatever you want.

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,490
That concept exists outside of you.

110
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,830
You found it.

111
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,965
You put your claim on it, and to me that
matches more closely with what we have to

112
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:48,160
do in the rest of our life once we
graduate.

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,590
And you know that's what you'll do, you
know as a little family and

114
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,820
that's what you'll do as a, in, in a team
of, you know, software engineers.

115
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,882
A mechanical way, I guess, of going about
it just never sinks in.

116
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,745
>> Mm-hm.

117
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,051
>> And you know, which, because I never
honed that aspect of my mind, you know,

118
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,730
at least in terms of math, of just you
know, remembering,

119
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,264
you know these steps on how to, I can
always get back to where I need to go, but

120
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:16,240
sometimes I have to spend a little bit of
time building that.

121
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,104
And I, I wonder, I mean, so the people I
guess in my life around me that have more

122
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:29,350
traditional math they also don't remember
the mechanics unless they're familiar.

123
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,130
But the difference is that they don't
often have the courage to sit there, or

124
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,210
that, that self-confidence of given enough
time and enough resources, and maybe

125
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:44,190
a couple other people to help me, I'm
going to be able to solve this problem.

126
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,765
You know, and it's, there's that sense of
self confidence and, you

127
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:52,250
know you know there's, you know the talk
about fixed versus growth mindsets and

128
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,370
sometimes, you know there's a certain
amount of courage I

129
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:02,988
think it takes to have a growth mindset,
you know and just self confidence.

130
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:07,680
And and so it, it doesn't seem like, the,
the traditional math to me seems like it

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,440
really doesn't offer students the ability
to develop their own sense of courage and

132
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,024
so they, if they're lucky enough to have
it and

133
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:22,115
maintain it through that math experience,
awesome, great.

134
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:25,030
But there's a chance that if, even if they
started to maintain it or

135
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,332
if they didn't come into math with that
already.

136
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,439
There's a really good chance that they'll
either lose it or

137
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,950
never, never gain that aspect of.

138
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,060
Which, then, to me, that's a really
critical part of life.

139
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,560
[MUSIC].

140
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:48,380
>> Because I saw that, for myself, was
really, that.

141
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,230
Really, what made, made a big difference.

142
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,376
Both when I was younger, and when I was
out of school.

143
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:53,944
>> Uh-huh.

144
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,674
>> What, what could be the answer to that?

145
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:56,962
>> Yeah.
>> How could that be?

146
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:57,721
>> Right.

147
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,786
>> Why?
>> Yeah.

148
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:02,944
>> And the more that we ask those
questions I think and

149
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:11,200
let children answer them, the more
interested they'll be in that topic.

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,750
And I, I, I think that for me that made a
big difference.

151
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,930
That, there were people who were willing
to help me figure out why.

152
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,428
And that takes a long time.

153
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:21,953
>> Right.
>> So

154
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:28,128
to, to figure out why there are two
different kinds of clouds in the sky.

155
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,763
>> Mm-hm.
>> To figure out, you know I don't know,

156
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:34,468
why one duck is floating faster down the
river than the other one, and

157
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:38,415
to do a little experiment with it.

158
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,744
>> Takes, takes time.

159
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,333
>> Yeah.

160
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,780
>> Which not a lot of us have myself
included.

161
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,064
And to answer, to not be willing to
answer, answer it with,

162
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:53,152
good question, let's figure it out
sometime or.

163
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,140
>> Yeah.
>> Let's do that later.

164
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,129
[LAUGH] To be, to be willing to cut
yourself is, is tough and

165
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,104
I think especially for an educator.

166
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:00,785
>> Mm-hm.

167
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:03,944
>> Has a classroom of kids.

168
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,888
But if you have I, I see some of my
daughter, my daughter's friends,

169
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:14,484
there might be very few circumstances
under which some of the kids will ask why.

170
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,144
>> Yeah.

171
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,892
>> And if you have a kid that asks why all
the time,

172
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:19,110
I think you have a lot of chances.

173
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,585
But if you have a kid who doesn't.

174
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:24,391
>> The time that he does say, why is that?

175
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,120
>> Yeah.

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,993
>> Great.

177
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:28,139
[LAUGH] Let's answer that for you.

178
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,959
And you see it in the workplace,

179
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,078
you see those people who have a creative
curiosity.

180
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:35,368
>> Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:41,570
>> And, and I, and, I have to believe that
it's been cultivated for them.

182
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,852
Some of us are more curious by nature,
sure.

183
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:47,274
That a, a lot of people have either let
themselves answer questions for

184
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:52,350
themselves or they've have people when
they were little help them answer.

185
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,752
That curiosity is what, what makes the
difference, I'm an engineer, makes

186
00:09:56,752 --> 00:10:03,474
the difference between someone who's a
perfectly fine engineer and someone who's.

187
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:07,750
>> He's a great engineer.

188
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,318
[MUSIC]

189
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:17,070
>> You know, so math was sort of a slogs.

190
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,090
There was nothing fun about it.

191
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,490
There was nothing, you know yehey, math!

192
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,570
You know, this is something I can,
whereas, you know I was reading books,

193
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,290
you know gobbling them up as much as
possible, so

194
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,735
it was part of my school life and my
pleasure life.

195
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:36,093
But by the time, and I actually started
calculus when we

196
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:41,140
started to doing sort of pasts like the
algebra calculus.

197
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,770
I was like oh, this is actually kind of
fun.

198
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,674
Like I like the, the,

199
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:52,375
kind of conceptual, conceptualizing of
math, ideas not numbers.

200
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,860
because the numbers were like, can you do
you do your times tables in your head?

201
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,377
No.

202
00:10:55,377 --> 00:11:00,660
But then we did geometry, and you think,
geometry, of course that's easy, right?

203
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,700
That's squares and circles, you know
spheres, but that, that was so

204
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,910
hard for me.

205
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,460
And I think I'm such a practical person.

206
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,985
I'm sort of a problem solver so

207
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:17,480
here I was, well I understand the circle
but it's a perfect thing.

208
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,860
And sort of circles aren't perfect.

209
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,010
And suddenly the, the, it took it to this
meta level and

210
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,591
I couldn't, I kind of put it in the real
world at all.

211
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,986
It was just, yeah.

212
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,562
>> So how does that make you feel?

213
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,210
>> Well, you feel terrible, right?

214
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,066
You feel sort of hopeless, and, and

215
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:38,010
especially when some people are getting it
and some people aren't, so there's no,

216
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,070
there's no parameter to say you know oh,
well that means I'm not so smart because I

217
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:49,660
don't understand geometry because that
other person seems to be doing fine.

218
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,944
And I think, I think, that, that sort of
breaking up of what you're good at and

219
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:58,840
what you're not good at suddenly makes the
world into sort of sequestered parts and

220
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,240
I think that plays with your self esteem
and, and you know you

221
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:11,020
walk down the street, you don't say well
I'm, I'm not good at walking so I'll skip.

222
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,250
Like you know it, it's, it's, you want to,
it the world is holistic.

223
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,678
Everything you do is connected so

224
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:19,126
when there's some thing, one thing that
you don't do well,

225
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:23,868
it makes you question whether, you know
you will do well with everything.

226
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,192
>> Mm-hm.

227
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:26,310
>> Well.
You know what I

228
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,420
think is really interesting in your class
when the, the math students.

229
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,620
They approach.

230
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,412
They were approaching math like we
approach humanities.

231
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,070
As,.

232
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,490
Not as a right or wrong answer.

233
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,430
Not as a.

234
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,180
There.
You know.

235
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,890
If you don't, if you don't follow these
steps,

236
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,158
you will not get to the pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow.

237
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:49,142
But that it, it's adaptable and changeable
and fluid, and

238
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:55,174
that your emotions can get involved and
you can feel it.

239
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,526
And I think, you know that, I think
there's something that we're taught about

240
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:06,630
numbers, that they're cold, you know,
they're, it's either right or it's wrong.

241
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,534
You either get it or you don't, and I
think that the difference of feeling,

242
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:15,460
you know, and we all have an intuitive
sense of numbers too.

243
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,340
I mean we all have an intuitive sense of
what time it is, or

244
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,970
how long something takes.

245
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,726
And you can develop those muscles to be
really good but to the minute or

246
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:26,470
to the number.

247
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,128
Or you can let that be loosy, goosy and
time will just disappear.

248
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:35,223
So I, I really sort of appreciated that
the, in human, we talked about the sort of

249
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:40,850
the sciences or the hard sciences and the
soft, you know, soft subjects.

250
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,580
And soft subjects are always given such a,
such a bad rap for being,

251
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:53,481
you know touchy, feely and not being about
accuracy or or true knowledge.

252
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:54,840
>> Mm-hm.

253
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,722
>> You know seeing,

254
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:59,628
seeing your class made me think of you
know numbers don't have to be hard and

255
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:06,130
impenetrable they're a part of they're,
they're one organic part of our lives.

256
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,370
So if you can have that sort of, if you
have feelings about math and

257
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,010
you could actually enjoy it.

258
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,786
[MUSIC]

259
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:23,644
>> Most of my, my math is extremely
intuitive.

260
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:27,178
>> I remember writing a paper actually
definitely [INAUDIBLE] for

261
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:32,138
Coursera on on a robotic formula which was
very complicated, mm hmm and I Intuitively

262
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:38,536
guess the formula correctly and implement
it and it worked beautifully.

263
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:39,724
And I spent the next like three or

264
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,572
four weeks trying to derive it
mathematically and

265
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:45,780
because I knew it was intuitively correct
and I couldn't quite understand why.

266
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,445
And eventually I got the math together, I
had to make certain assumptions that

267
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:51,511
were implicit in the duration that made
the formula correct.

268
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:56,100
I always felt math was just about the most
intuitive thing on the planet.

269
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,748
Its just explained very poorly, like well
all know, i don't know, how long one

270
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:03,225
hours are, two hours are, we don't know
something that takes two hours and

271
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:08,185
we wait for sixteen hours a day, what
things we can do.

272
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:12,741
And at that level of math, I think really
easy, and really everything from measure

273
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:20,090
theory, to integration, to like the most
abstract approximation fee and asymptotes.

274
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,990
I think that's similar nature, they're
very intuitive.

275
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,060
These are observations are key
observations I think.

276
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,010
And everybody is proficient at those.

277
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,984
Everybody knows how to play Sudoku.

278
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,434
>> Mm-hm.

279
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:33,674
>> And then the, the, the sad part is
when, when, when the abstraction comes

280
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:37,990
along putting this into formulas, people
often lose intuition.

281
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,062
They think, boy, these are like abstract
little things they have to

282
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:41,870
manipulate according to fixed rules.

283
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,906
And those fixed rule manipulations are
devoid of an,

284
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:47,700
of an intuitive interpretation.

285
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,330
And that's when we should just stop, we
should just not do it.

286
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,390
We should refuse to do it.

287
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,705
We should say, okay, I only am willing to
manipulate equations I understand.

288
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,330
I understand intuitively, and if it takes
us longer, that's fine.

289
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,397
I remember in my early scientific career,
I, I,

290
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:03,577
I stared at papers that from today's
perspective look easy, and I want to

291
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:08,954
spend two weeks thinking about what math
formula to unders, internalize it.

292
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:13,514
And after two weeks, I would get it
eventually and understand it, and

293
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:18,714
then these two weeks made this piece of
complicated math We the intuitive have

294
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:23,914
never been able to make any progress in
math without really understanding and

295
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:31,477
having an emotional relationship to what's
happening.

296
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,750
[MUSIC] [MUSIC]. Now, you've watched all
five of the interviews.

297
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,370
I'd like you to choose one of them.

298
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,720
And write about a really cool, either a
lesson idea, perhaps.

299
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,460
Or a discussion topic, if you're a parent.

300
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,000
That the math person's words and ideas
make you think about.

301
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,588
One of them, at least, I'm sure, inspired
you to do something really interesting in

302
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:52,220
a class or in a conversation.

303
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,196
And I want to give you a space to write
about that now.

304
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:57,510
So write a paragraph, perhaps, about that.

305
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,727
It's going to be sent to three other
people, and

306
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:09,931
you'll get others' people's to comment on.
