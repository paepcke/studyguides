1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,852
So an other amazingly effective
intervention in 2006

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:08,352
researchers asked this time seventh grade
students.

3
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:12,186
And they asked half of the seventh grade
students to write a short

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:18,550
written reflection of this beginning of
school about their personal values.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,640
They did this at the start of seventh
grade.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,084
They wrote about their values, and what
they meant to them, and

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,738
why they're important.

8
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,088
The other half, randomly, were asked to
write about values that other people had

9
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:31,390
and why they thought they might have those
values.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,290
What was incredible from that was the
minority students who

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,958
completed the writing, so it's about their
own values,

12
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,680
closed the racial achievement gap over the
next year by 40%.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,360
So, we know that students with the
greatest detachment from their schools and

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,733
the least trust that people believe in
them in a school environment.

15
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,030
That's minority students.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,460
It can be girls in man's environments in
similar ways.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,592
It's those students that gain the most
from these interventions that

18
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:04,810
really target social belonging.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,925
So I asked you a moment ago to think of or
a while ago,

20
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:10,390
to think of what we could do about
stereotypes.

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,220
Now I want you to design something that's
more targeted.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,526
I want you to draw from the ideas you've
just heard about messages and

23
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:22,950
writings tasks and think about something
you would do with a class of students.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,040
You don't have to be a teacher to think
about this and do it.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,825
It could be similar to what you've heard,
that you've adapted in some way.

26
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:33,101
But try and plan something of your own
that [INAUDIBLE] an activity that you

27
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,290
think would help in mathematics class.

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,765
Maybe you prefer a particular group, maybe
it's for all students.

29
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:44,096
Remember as you're doing this that the
researchers planned a really tiny

30
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,013
intervention, a one sentence or

31
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:53,225
a writing task to look at something very
targeted, what they call wise feedback.

32
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,061
That doesn't mean it's the best thing for

33
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:58,140
teachers to do as you design an
intervention.

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,305
You can think of anything at all.

35
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,161
So after you've written this, and maybe
you'll write a paragraph I think for this,

36
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,849
[INAUDIBLE] your paragraph's going to be
sent around to three other people who

37
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,090
are going to comment on it.

38
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,376
And you're going to get it, the comments
back.

39
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,620
And your going to get three other people's
paragraphs to look at.
