1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,150
So, I use math every day, every minute of
my life.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,330
But not the way math is usually thought of
as big formulas.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,150
But math is a way to look at life.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,920
I mean, I go to a supermarket and buy
things, I use math.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,214
I drive to work and look at my phone to
see what the congestion level is, and

6
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,390
I use math to understand how long the
commute will take me.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,730
And I use math in my own research, when I
build robots that navigate Streets.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,416
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,104
>> I emulate the human brain's information
processing, and

10
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:35,352
it's known that the way we process
multiple sources of information is

11
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:41,470
somewhat reminiscence of some of the more
abstract math, like bases and statistics.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,740
I find it extremely empowering because
[UNKNOWN] is geometric, time is geometric,

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,640
space is geometric.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,100
We operate in time and space all the time.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,740
And to understand how space interacts with
us and time and

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,380
people, math is just a great concept.
