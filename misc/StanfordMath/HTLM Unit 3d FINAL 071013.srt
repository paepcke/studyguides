1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,929
So my first point was that mistakes are
helpful for learning, but

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,738
the second thing I want to talk about is
persistence.

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,874
When employers complain about students
coming out of the education system,

5
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:19,880
the chief thing they complain about is
lack of persistence.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,170
That young people will try, and then very
quickly give up.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,026
And this quote comes from Ray Peacock,

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:29,360
who is the Director of Research at Philips
Laboratories in the UK.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,250
And this is what he said.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,651
He said, lots of people think knowledge is
what we want, and

11
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,570
I don't believe that because knowledge is
astonishingly transitory.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,850
We don't employ people as knowledge bases.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,600
We employ people to actually do things or
solve things.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,740
Knowledge basis comes out of books, so I
want flexibility and continuous learning

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,600
and I need team-working, and part of
team-working is communication.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,456
When you're out doing any job in any
business the tasks are not

17
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:59,208
forty-five minutes max, they're usually
three week dollops or one day dollop or

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:04,480
something, and the guy that gives up, oh
sod it, you don't want him.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,536
So the things therefore the flexibility,
the team work, communications and

20
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,230
the sheer persistence.

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,516
Now I'm sure for the teachers in the
course the lack of persistence amongst

22
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:18,980
students is a big concern for you too.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,770
The students want to be spoon feed in math
lessons and many teachers tell me

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,520
that they've learned how great it is to
give open challenging tasks.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,290
But when they give them out, the students
say they can't do them.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,715
Now what students are doing in those
moments is reflecting the math's culture

27
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,783
that's been imposed on teachers in the
last decade or

28
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:40,830
so of doing lots and lots of equations
that don't require any deep thought.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,120
Questions for which they've already been
told what method to use.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,741
So it also reflects what French scholar
Guy Brousseau termed

31
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,040
the didactic contract.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,490
And he pointed out that what often happens
in classrooms is this.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,514
Students get stuck on a question and they
call the teacher over for help, and

34
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:00,680
they want to be led step by step through
the work.

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,028
But that takes out the cognitive demand of
the problem, and the trouble is,

36
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:08,770
kids don't expect to struggle and they
want to be helped with each step.

37
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,074
And teachers in their turn feel an
implicit contract that says they

38
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:14,850
should help students who need help.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,099
So both the teachers and the students work
within this contract, and

40
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,050
they work together to empty the
interaction of learning.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,910
And that's what's called the didactic
contract, and it's been

42
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,780
widely recognized and a lot of work done
on it in France and across the world.

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,750
So my question for you now is, do you
recognize this contract?

44
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,100
Think if you can, about a particular
situation as a parent or

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,311
a teacher and talk about the presence or

46
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:46,090
absence of this contract in your
interaction with a math student.
