1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,066
So I understand that we want students to
do well in exams with a time limit,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:07,706
later probably if you're an elementary or,
or a middle school teacher, but

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:14,030
what not to do is make them anxious when
they're learning by timing them.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,030
What we should do is make them comfortable
with numbers and with all of maths.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,230
And if the anxiety or fear is taken away
They will work much more quickly.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,640
The other point I want to make is that
timed tests and other speed pressures

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,140
misrepresent math as a subject that's all
about working on factual questions fast.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,090
That isn't math, it's not the mathematics
that mathematicians work on

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,530
It's not the mathematics that's needed in
the workplace.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,372
And in later sessions we're going to hear
from top math users,

11
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:46,142
people in Silcone Valley who work in
technology, people in medicine, in film,

12
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:49,530
people are team leaders.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,560
It's really important to listen, I think,
to the ways people use maths now.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,600
But many, many students in the UK and the
US and beyond develop the strong

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,925
impression that those who are best at math
are those who can do it quickly.

16
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,630
That's damaging and wrong.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,495
And it puts off those students who think
deeply and carefully.

18
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:10,200
Cathy Seeley the former president of NCTM
has written a great book on

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,290
this called Faster Isn't Smarter.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,524
So speed is the enemy of a mistakes
friendly culture, and

21
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:21,490
we should really use it in moderation or
not at all.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,210
So what can we do to change the culture of
maths classrooms and maths times and home.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,020
Here's some strategies I can think of to
help students value mistakes.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,030
Later I'm going to ask you to add some of
your own in the forum.

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,228
So If you're a teacher start classes the
norm that you love and want mistakes.

26
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,980
And don't just say, I love mistakes.

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,780
Mistakes are good, We learn from mistakes.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,713
But give students time and when make- when
they make a mistake ask them to present it

29
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,520
for everybody to see it.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,626
One of the best teachers that I've ever
worked with regularly did

31
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:53,870
that with students.

32
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,160
I saw her right at the beginning of the
year when.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,040
Say to one of her students, oh would you
go and present that on the board.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,650
And he said, well I got it wrong.

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,459
And then she explained that, you know,
it's really great for

36
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,830
us to see mistakes because if one
student's made others will have to.

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,890
And we can all learn, and the student said
oh, okay, and got up and showed it.

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,006
And after that And other messages from the
teacher,

39
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:18,040
students became really willing to take
risks and to make mistakes publicly.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,290
And in the last session, we'll see some of
those students at work.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,870
For parents and for other helpers, the
ideas are the same.

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,886
When I have tutored people in math, I've
always started by saying,

43
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:33,060
by the way I just want you to know that I
love mistakes the most.

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,074
They are the time that your brain grows,
when you really learn so

45
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,972
it's really great to make mistakes.

46
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:40,812
Mistakes, and people immediately relax and
breathe a sigh of relief and

47
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:45,780
are much more willing to jump in to
problems and persist longer.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,230
So the second advice is, don't just praise
mistakes but

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,530
talk about why they're important.

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,752
Maybe at the start of the year or

51
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:58,340
at other times talk to students about
brain growth and about some of the ideas.

52
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,520
I presented in this session and the last
session.

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,870
And at the end of this session you're
going to have an opportunity to brainstorm

54
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,680
the ways you can talk to students about
the brain and the importance of mistakes.

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,470
The third point is to give work that
encourages mistakes.

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,356
If students aren't making mistakes in
their math work,

57
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,910
they're not doing work at the right level
for them.

58
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,730
So try and always push the boundaries.

59
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,230
Keep them at the edge of their
understanding at all times.

60
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,720
And this may require talking to them about
what's most helpful for them.

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,869
For example, you can tell students that
when they get a question right that's not

62
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,850
really producing learning.

63
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,182
And if you're getting all questions right,

64
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,640
you're probably not doing work that's
challenging enough.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,530
And as Carol has said, students are
missing out and

66
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,170
they're not getting the chance to make
mistakes.

67
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,994
For parents, you know by now that I think
one of the biggest helps you can

68
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:49,090
give your children is to dispel myths.

69
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,010
And now that comes in the ways that you
help and guide them.

70
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,200
So first of all, encourage mistakes at all
times.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,830
And importantly, don't share with them
your own painful experiences of math in

72
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,950
school if you had those.

73
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,660
Research has found that as soon as mothers
told their daughters that they were bad at

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,105
maths in school, which mothers often say
to help their daughters feel better,

75
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:13,120
their daughters achievement immediately
went down.

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,380
If you're not confident with math
yourself, the best thing to say is great.

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,400
We can learn this together.

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,500
I don't know this either.

79
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,830
You can help me with this.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,870
And whenever they come home with math
homework, greet it with cheers.

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,860
Say yay, I'm so excited, math homework.

82
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,710
I love working on math, especially math I
can't do.

83
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,130
So my own daughter who is in fourth grade
really lacks confidence in math.

84
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,850
She had some terrible experiences early on
in school with.

85
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,190
Fixed mindset messages.

86
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,420
But this was a classic example of an
interaction I had with her.

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,900
I recently went into a third grade maths
class with her.

88
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,750
And together, we watched the teacher put
up two questions.

89
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,330
One of which she got correct, and the
other she got wrong.

90
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,050
And she immediately went, oh, you know?

91
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,821
I should have added the one, not taken it
away.

92
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,140
And then she said, oh gosh.

93
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,250
I am so bad at maths.

94
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,070
I'm even worse than third graders, I'm
terrible.

95
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,050
And, and so I said to her.

96
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,600
You know what just happened there in that
question that you got right?

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,740
Nothing happened in your brain.

98
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,060
But in the question that you got wrong,
and that you thought about.

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,970
Your brain grew at that time, that was
really great.

100
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,450
And I could see her like really thinking
about that.

101
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,268
So my fourth bit of advice is to grade,
particularly for

102
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,080
teachers, to grade differently, or not at
all.

103
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,070
And I'm going to talk more on this next
session.

104
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,595
But the way you grade and give feedback to
students is really important.

105
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:33,205
So a cool thing to do when you grade, if
you give grades,

106
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:38,800
is to give students their papers back and
highlight mistakes but really positively.

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,130
Give them gold stars or comments or
whatever.

108
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,949
And then always let them correct their
mistakes and get the points or

109
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,790
even more, get double points.

110
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,536
Because it's such a great, those are the
great learning moments.

111
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:56,800
more, I'm going to talk more in assessment
and grading in the next lesson.

112
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,680
The final piece you're going to be
surprised about,

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,400
of advice is to dissociate math from
speed.

114
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,536
The new common core didn't do enough in my
view to make the content of

115
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:10,504
the curriculum the content that our young
people will need, but

116
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,144
they did something really important, and
they said that it's only useful to be

117
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:17,840
learning content if you're also learning
what they set out in the mathematical

118
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,440
practices to solve problems, to reason, to
be persistent, and so on.

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,388
But of course that takes longer as there's
a need to go deeper, which is great, and

120
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,248
I think teachers would have been really
helped in my opinion if the content had

121
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:33,930
been slimmed down.

122
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,017
Although that's just my, my opinion but
for parents it's just as important not to

123
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:44,210
use speed, not to use things like flash
cards or other speed math practice.

124
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,470
So we're in the resources section.

125
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,438
I'm going to give you some alternative
phone Apps and programs that will help

126
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:56,060
with math fluency without putting kids
under that negative speed pressure.

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,240
And if you're in a school where you're
made to give time test to kids.

128
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,470
Then try and advocate just for losing the
timing.

129
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,872
Because researchers have found that the
exact same tests without the timed

130
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:09,220
component don't create anxiety.

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
Even better, try and replace those tests
with teaching strategies that

132
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,740
will actually help teach fluency, rather
than just test it.

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,157
And then the next sessions I'm going to
show you a great teaching strategy for

134
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,401
parents or teachers that teaches number
fluency and

135
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,290
conceptual understanding together.

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,150
Of course, it would've helped teachers to
work in these ways if

137
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,725
the content was not so packed, but rushing
through content because there's so

138
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:36,080
much of it doesn't help, and the most
successful schools have studied

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,710
the teachers got together and worked out,
what are the big ideas in this year?

140
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,880
What are the core ideas?

141
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,448
And they really planned for those, and

142
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:49,380
I didn't worry if students didn't get
through all of the smaller methods.

143
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,920
And those students did better than those
who like go through everything.

144
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,920
So of course covering every thing doesn't
that students are learning everything.

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,260
So it's not always, if it's too fast, it's
not that helpful.

146
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,883
So take the time, take the time to present
maths as a subject that's interesting,

147
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:10,440
make it visual, connected, and deep.

148
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,320
Presenting maths fast doesn't help.

149
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,797
If you have students who have finished in
class, encourage them to go deeper.

150
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,065
I often ask students just to, if they've
finished,

151
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,995
to think of other questions that are
similar and work on them.

152
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,340
And that's a great thing for them to do.

153
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,952
So the first time I showed the release
items or

154
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:30,560
the Common Core to a group of teachers
they freaked out.

155
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,870
They were saying my students won't be able
to do this.

156
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,030
The problems were more open, they require
thinking.

157
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,810
They don't have A B C D choices.

158
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,210
The students will be able to do those
problems.

159
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,043
not because we've crammed them with more
knowledge, but

160
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,690
because we've given them the belief that
they can succeed.

161
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,980
And the mistakes are no important part of
their work and their learning.
