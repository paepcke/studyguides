1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,978
So, a really interesting study on this was
done by Barbara White and

2
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:06,640
John Frederiksen.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,080
And they conducted a research study with
12 classes of students learning physics.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,730
Students were divided into 2 groups.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,970
There was a controlled and experimental
group.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,162
Both groups were taught force and motion.

7
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:22,846
But the control group spent portions of
each lesson discussing the work,

8
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:25,750
while the experimental group spent the
same amount of time engaging in peer and

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,180
self assessment, and the results were
dramatic.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,204
The experimental group outperformed the
control group on three different

11
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:32,924
assessments, and

12
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:37,550
the greatest gains were made by those who
were previously low achieving.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,134
After the low achievers spent time
discussing assessing themselves and

14
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,038
others on these different assessments,

15
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:47,380
they started behaving like the highest
achievers.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,613
And the researchers concluded that low
achievers are often thought of as

17
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:54,111
lacking ability or, being slow, but what
they actually found was that they were

18
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:57,291
often low achieving just because they
don't know what's important, and

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,690
what they're meant to be paying attention
to.

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,605
And the seventh graders in this study
scored higher levels then

21
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,080
AP Physics students on tests of high
school physics so

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,580
the impact of that, self and peer
assessment was dramatic.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,230
So one the best assessment for

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,076
learning sites I know of comes from a
collaboration between the UK and the US.

25
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,858
The show center at Nottingham University
and the Mars Collaborative and

26
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:26,368
I'm going to give you a link to their
site.

27
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,592
And what I want you to do for this
assignment is go to their site,

28
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:33,436
go to the lessons part of the site and
you'll find a whole range of formative

29
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:40,155
assessment or assessment for learning
lessons from grade 6 to high school.

30
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:43,070
And the way the materials work on this
site very nicely is that they

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,289
provide a whole lesson, and

32
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:49,921
they provide a pre-assessment the students
take at the beginning of a unit.

33
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:54,620
Then the teachers know how and where to
direct questions, and help improve them.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,080
Then there's a lesson, and I'm going to
get you to look at those.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,328
There are a few examples, and

36
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,552
I've selected three different ones that
probably would be most helpful if

37
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:07,750
you're an elementary, middle, or high
school teacher.

38
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,715
Choose the one for your grade level, or
just one that you're interested in.

39
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,785
So for the elementary teachers,

40
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:19,453
I think the grade six lesson called
optimizing security cameras would be good.

41
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:24,350
For grade there's a lesson on classifying
solutions to systems of equation.

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,119
For the middle school teachers and

43
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:31,255
the high school teachers, I think solving
quadratic equation lessons is good.

44
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:35,281
So, go to those lessons now, and what I
want you to do is read all of the teacher

45
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:41,450
guide and the introduction before the
lesson and suggested lesson outline.

46
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,348
And then do the student work and

47
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:48,880
then after you've done that, I'd like you
to reflect a bit on.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,975
What you see in that Formative Assessment
Lesson, what resources you see that

49
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:59,060
might be valuable to you in your thinking
as a teacher or parent or administrator.

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,256
So, the question for you is,

51
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:03,012
what resources do you see in that
Formative Assessment Lesson,

52
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:06,288
what ideas do you see that might be
valuable to you whether you're a teacher,

53
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:12,100
parent, or administrator, anybody, and how
might they support a growth mindset.
