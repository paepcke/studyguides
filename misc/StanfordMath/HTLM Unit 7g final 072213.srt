1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,535
When researchers gave that problem to
students,

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:06,890
they found that it really helped them in
forming different expressions.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,850
And they learned how to manipulate
algebra, and

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,545
how to set up algebraic expressions that
they wouldn't have got if

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:16,210
they'd just been asked to represent the
situation in one way.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,222
So, finally, my other principle is to
integrate the mathematical practices into

7
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,820
the teaching of algebra.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,318
The great thing about the new common core
in the US is the writers realize that we

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,960
can't we just set out this content
anymore.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,766
We need to get student working in
mathematical ways and

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,780
they call these mathematical practices.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,122
The idea of practices also came from a
group I was in, it was a group made up of

13
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:48,980
a lot of mathematicians and a few
mathematics educators.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,612
And we were working to produce advice for

15
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:54,210
the government on the most fruitful
directions on future research.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,450
Deborah Ball chaired that group.

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,408
And one of the directions we nominated was
mathematical practices as

18
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:02,366
many people knew that it was these
practices that separated those who

19
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,130
were successful in maths from those who
weren't.

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,710
And the mathematicians were really
passionate about that.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,004
And it turns out that these important
practices that are now to be

22
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:18,480
addressed across the content in the US and
are going to be assessed.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,850
Have some real, really particular
importance in algebra.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,793
So, one of the great books to

25
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:26,070
read about all of this is Mark Driscoll's
Fostering Algebraic Thinking.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,260
And he nominates doing and undoing as a
central practice in algebraic thinking.

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,069
Doing and undoing means being able to
reason both forwards, but

28
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,030
also backwards with operations.

29
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,110
So, an example of that type of thinking
might be,

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,890
first finding the number of blocks in pile
seven in a growth pattern task.

31
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,490
And then giving students a number of
blocks, and

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,270
asking them, which pile would have that
many.

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,262
So, I'm going to show you some examples of
these principles through classroom video

34
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,166
and a teaching intervention where I was
one of the teachers teaching algebra to

35
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,788
disaffected 7th and 8th graders.

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,700
And that so I'm going to start that by
asking you to do a problem now.

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,254
You may know it, but do it anyway.

38
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,970
And for this problem I don't want to leave
the visual lo, long for a reason.

39
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,920
This isn't one way you would give this
visual out to students.

40
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,762
So, I'd like you to figure out, mentally,
without counting one by one.

41
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,940
Without talking without writing how many
squares are in the colored portion.
