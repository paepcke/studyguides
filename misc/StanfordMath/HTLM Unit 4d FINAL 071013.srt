00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,965
So when we use this task, when we were
teaching algebra to some seventh and

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:07,430
eighth graders, a group of three students
saw it grow in two different ways,

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,790
as you can see from a picture of their
work.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,060
With one of the boys, saw it growing as
cubes adding onto the bottom row

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:22,930
each time, and the other one saw it as
cubes adding onto each column.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,780
Now there are other ways of seeing the
growth that you might have seen.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,375
Some people see it as growing square, for
example.

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,124
But as students worked on that task, and

9
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,986
we also asked them to work at how many
cubes were in the 100th case,

10
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:38,590
they really had to think about the shape,
and the form, and the number of cubes.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,614
And as they worked on that, they came to
develop and

12
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,815
understand a quadratic function.

13
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:46,460
So that's really big.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,485
They weren't just given a function to
manipulate, but

15
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,270
they are actually forming it.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,005
They were seeing it visually and
understanding its components.

17
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,765
And as the students worked on the task,

18
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:59,175
the first thing they realized was that
they'd seen it in different ways and

19
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:05,000
they talked about that and that deepened
their understanding of the function.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,900
They then work to try and work out how the
shape was growing.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,626
When I've worked in workshops and I've
given this task to

22
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:14,106
teachers with the same wording, asking
them to find the hundredth case,

23
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:18,783
thinking they would work in similar ways
to the students.

24
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:21,653
Instead they made a table, put in the
numbers,

25
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:27,046
could see that the function was growing as
an n plus 1 squared.

26
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:32,540
Function put in the number for the 100th
case and came up with an answer.

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,186
Then, when I asked them what their n
represented, and

28
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:41,155
their n plus 1 squared, they really didn't
know what their n represented.

29
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:45,955
And I realized that that's changing the
presentation of asking people,

30
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,275
how do you see the shape growing and

31
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:54,780
how many cubes were in case 100,
completely changed the task.

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,004
So now, when I do workshops with teachers,
I might ask for the 100th case but

33
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:03,280
I always start just by asking that, how do
you see the shape growing, as I asked you.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,384
[MUSIC]
At Stanford we developed a framework for

35
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:15,036
what we thought were the essential
features of growth mindset tasks.

36
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,510
And this is that framework.

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,470
The last one the goals and opportunities
for

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,090
feedback, I'm going to talk about in a
minute.

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,825
But I want you now to stop and look at
that task's framework and think and

40
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,680
write about the different dimensions we
have in there.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,520
And think about how the two versions of
the task,

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,644
one where we asked students to find the
100th case and

43
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:42,850
one where we ask them to see how the shape
is growing, differ on that framework.
