[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,834
Across the United States, students are
failing algebra, or

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,795
to put in another way, we are failing
students.

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:16,284
In urban districts, as many as 70% of
students are failing introductory algebra

5
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:22,250
classes and around 40% of students fail
the same class over and over again.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,310
There's a reason for this situation.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,808
Algebra, in most schools and definitely in
the vast majority of all textbooks,

8
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:31,935
is taught in a way that goes against all
the knowledge we've gained from

9
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:37,270
research about effective teaching and
learning of algebra.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,850
Students are set off in the wrong path
from the beginning.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,038
And many students and

12
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:46,550
adults will tell you algebra is just an
act of maneuvering meaningless symbols.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,658
In algebra, as in the number and
arithmetic work that we've looked at,

14
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,230
students resort to memorizing facts.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,569
Which sends them down that terrible
pathway that I've talked about that for

16
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:02,270
many ends their chance of learning maths
well.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,902
This is a serious equity issue with
failure rates among students in

18
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:09,760
urban districts, particularly minority
students, reaching shocking proportions.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,718
Jack Humphrey points to the need for a
change across the whole system,

20
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:17,820
teachers, administrators, districts and
parents are all needed in this.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,870
In fact we know parents have an important
role to play.

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,326
Researchers know that the students who are
in homes where parents are supporting them

23
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:28,120
in their algebraic reasoning, are those
who do a lot better.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,671
And often that's hard for parents who're
juggling many jobs to make ends meet and

25
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:37,810
don't have places, and students don't have
places to sit and work quietly at home.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,094
The algebra for all initiative, which came
in to many states across the US, and

27
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:48,410
states that all students take algebra in
eighth grade has not helped failure rates.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,484
In fact, it's worsened them as algebra
continues to be taught in

29
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,340
the same inequitable [INAUDIBLE] and

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,150
inaccessible way that misses the most
important ideas of algebra.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,365
Many students fail and then fail again and
again.

32
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:04,381
It's, not surprisingly, you, you know, we
should all try taking a dry,

33
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:08,250
meaningless algebra course after we failed
it the first time.

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,605
It really becomes almost impossible with
the fixed mindset ideas

35
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:14,540
students have received.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,059
Andrew Hacker, who's a writer for the New
York Times, caused a firestorm recently,

37
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:21,017
when he wrote an article saying we
shouldn't make all students take or

38
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,600
pass algebra.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,732
It ends the careers of thousands of great
people who don't need it, but

40
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:29,650
their college careers end because of it.

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,946
And he argues that it's not necessary in
life, and

42
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:36,100
that he's never used it in his life or
career.

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,220
I think if algebra continues to be taught
in the way that it has been then I

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,920
agree with him.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,416
But if algebra was introduced and taught
with meaning and

46
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,744
excitement then we wouldn't need to argue
that the requirement be dropped as

47
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:50,115
everyone would enjoy and benefit from it.

48
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:53,181
As Bob Moses, this famous civil rights
campaign of

49
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:57,650
the 1960s has argued Algebra is the new
civil right.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,910
So, why is it important besides being the
main gate keeper to a world of

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,170
high achievement?

52
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,612
Beyond that, why is this subject
important.

53
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:09,417
Now, I'm going to ask you to answer that
through this quiz first,

54
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:12,020
why should students learn Algebra?

55
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,570
Or shouldn't they?

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,000
Give you a response to that.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,500
