1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,760
So now we're going to learn about
stereotype threat.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,050
My dean, Claude Steel, he's dean of the
Stanford graduate school of education.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,430
He's a world renowned psychologist and he
conceptualized and

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,135
started a whole field of work on what's
called stereotype threat and

5
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:19,645
over the decades Claude and his colleagues
have discovered that

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,675
many people suffer from stereotypes Women
in maths, African American and

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:32,250
academic, students in academic settings,
white students, around sporting ability.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,392
So they have many studies on stereotype
threat and

9
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:37,050
they have many studies on girls and maths.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,700
Showing that if women take a test and

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,770
beforehand just mark off their gender in a
box, they underperform.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,170
If they don't mark off their gender,
there's no underperformance.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,842
A group of psychologists at Princeton
conducted an experiment with white and

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,700
African American students who were given a
golfing task.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,064
When the white students were given the
task and they were told that it,

16
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,674
the golfing task measured natural athletic
ability,

17
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:07,020
they golfed allot worse than the white
students who were not told anything.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,918
When the same messages were given to black
students, it didn't affect their

19
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:13,960
performance, as poor athletic ability
isn't a stereotype they suffer from.

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,317
In the early studies they reminded people
of gender differences by getting them to

21
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,320
mark gender on a form.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,804
Later they found that they didn't even
need to do that, because stereotypes are,

23
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:29,590
as they say, always in the air, which is
why they call it stereotype threat.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,690
There's always the threat of that
stereotype, and

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,290
researchers have found the gender and

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,550
math stereotype to be established in girls
as young as five years old.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,972
So they talk about the fact that young
girls are put off from engaging in

28
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:45,220
math before they have even had a chance to
engage in maths because of

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,500
the stereotypes in the air.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,125
So Claude concludes in his book.

31
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:55,650
The stereotype threat affects all of us in
subtle and not so subtle ways.

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,190
But they're all damaging, and I really
recommend reading the entire book.

33
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,893
This student that I'm going to, play for
you now, really showed for

34
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:07,465
me the, that subtle, in-the-air effect of
the stereotype.

35
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:11,953
>> I would say that I've felt
discrimination from classmates as

36
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:13,855
a female.

37
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:19,110
I think that not so much of high school
but here I feel it.

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,302
Like not directly but subtle things like,
oh, like they won't ask me for

39
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:29,582
my help or they just will like kind of
bulldoze over what I'm saying so

40
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:36,780
not anything direct, but subtle things.

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,143
>> I'm constantly amazed by how many
students are given gender messages,

42
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:44,400
whether subtle or not so subtle, math
isn't for you.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,215
And here's another one of my students
talking about that.

44
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:50,431
>> In fourth grade, I remember being so
curious about why

45
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,848
a square was a rectangle, but a rectangle
wasn't a square, and

46
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,399
really caring about those sorts of
problems, and then as soon as

47
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:04,865
people start telling you math isn't your
thing, then it's all downhill.

48
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,245
>> So as students come to math classrooms
and

49
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:11,393
doing math work with some serious
stereotypes in the air about gender and

50
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:16,360
about race, and these combine with general
views.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,040
That only some kids can be good at maths
and

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,735
that maths is about a natural ability that
only some people have.

53
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,375
And we're going to look closely at that
one idea of natural ability in

54
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,940
the next sessions.

55
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,614
So we're beginning to see part of the
reason that mathematics education is in

56
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,010
a poor state.

57
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,137
Some messages can send students off the
rails even if they aren't about

58
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,477
gender or race.

59
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:42,371
People have told me recalling really in
very sharp detail how once in seventh or

60
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:44,259
eighth grade they asked a question and

61
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,796
the teacher said to them, that's a baby
question and

62
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:52,879
how they decided at that point the maths
was not the subject for them.

63
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,006
So the first session in the student
version of this class will be

64
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:59,251
about countering these stereotypes and
bolstering students and

65
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,499
negating those messages that they may have
heard, and really helping them believe and

66
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:08,206
know that they can be really good at math.

67
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:12,120
So a quick shortish question now for you.

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,456
What do you think you can do, as a
teacher, or as a parent, or whatever

69
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:28,532
role you have, to counter these damaging
stereotypes.
