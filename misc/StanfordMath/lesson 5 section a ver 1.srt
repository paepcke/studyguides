1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:09,071
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,347
So there are very few research studies,
very, very few that I have read.

3
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,287
And immediately thought the results were
so powerful they needed to be blasted from

4
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:19,070
the rooftops and everybody should know
about them.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,622
But here's one two British professors,
Eddie Gray and

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:28,230
David Tall, worked with 72 students
between the ages of 7 and 13.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,921
And they had asked teachers to nominate
students they thought of as above average,

8
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:31,910
average.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,930
Average and below average.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,440
They then gave the students various
addition and subtraction problems to do,

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,190
and they categorized their strategies.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,880
For example, they gave them problems such
as 7 plus 18 which is the addition of

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,900
a single digit number to a teen digit
number.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,740
As you can see here.

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,634
And what they found was that students used
four different strategies when they

16
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:57,970
worked on number problems.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,120
So the strategies were some students
counted all.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,320
So, with 7 plus 18 they would say 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and count up to 18.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,012
And then to add them, they would count
them all again.

21
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:15,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and go on
like that.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,330
The slightly more sophisticated strategy
of counting on is

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,500
when students would add up to 7 or to 18
and then continue on.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,049
So, if they'd added 18 they would then say
19, 20, 21.

25
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,400
Known facts was when students just knew
what the the number was.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
They just remembered them.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,431
And what they could derived facts, which I
recall number sense which this

28
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:44,380
whole session is about, was when students
were able to break numbers apart.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,335
And decompose and add them, and use them.

30
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:48,890
flexibly.

31
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,416
So, for example, they might say with 8
plus 17, I'm going to take 8 plus 2,

32
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,820
and make that into ten.

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:05,370
and, or they may break 17 into 15 plus 2,
and then calculate 15 and 2, and 8.

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,150
So, they make the problems into easier
addition problems.

35
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,140
And the results from age the eight year
olds was stunning to me.

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,980
So the above average students, 30% of them
knew their numbers.

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,515
They used facts, known facts.

38
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,440
61% used number sense.

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,970
So they used the numbers flexibly.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,165
And 9% counted on In the below average
group, 6% of them use known facts,

41
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:39,641
none of them use number sense, 72% of them
counted on, and 22% counted all.

42
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,860
When they worked with the ten year olds,
they found that the below average group

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,100
were using the same number of known facts
as the above average eight year olds.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,738
So they're sort of caught up in, in the
number they remember over time.

45
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:57,900
But still virtually no number sense, and
instead they were continuing to count.

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,770
So why's this finding so important?

47
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,186
The researchers who did the study put it
well, they concluded that the low

48
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,322
achievers, so often thought of as slow
learners, were actually not

49
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:14,149
working more slowly but they were learning
a different form of mathematics.

50
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:17,249
And what's more, the mathematics that the
low achievers were learning was

51
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,870
the more difficult form of mathematics.

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,300
So let's think about this issue of the
more difficult mathematics.

53
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,720
With the case of counting back.

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,560
Counting back is a strategy that young
children use when subtracting two numbers.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,430
So when you consider a problem such as, 16
take away 13.

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,372
If you start at 16 and count down thirteen
numbers, 16, 15, 14, 13,

57
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:42,825
12 You'll find that this is actually an
extremely difficult task, and

58
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:49,850
it has significant cognitive complexity
and enormous room for error.

59
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,875
By contrast, this strategy of the high
achievers, let's subtract him from 10 and

60
00:03:54,875 --> 00:04:00,120
3 from 6, which leaves 3 is much easier to
use.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,936
And those are the cu,

62
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,960
type of strategies that high achieving
students are able to use.

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,736
So the fact that high achievers had
learned to act upon numbers flexibly, and

64
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:13,530
the low achieving students hadn't, is
important, really important.

65
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,642
Because the flexible use of numbers and

66
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:19,430
shapes It's critical to higher level maths
learning.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,350
In fact it's foundational for everything
that comes above.

68
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,500
All the higher level work.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,820
In algebra, calculus, and beyond.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,495
So the problem for

71
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:33,029
low achieving children is not that they
cannot work in these ways.

72
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,690
But they haven't learned to engage with
maths in those ways.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,128
And the researchers found that when the
low-achievers failed,

74
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,750
using their counting methods, they didn't
change their method, but

75
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,750
they fell back into counting more and
more.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,110
And the problem for those students comes
about because they may

77
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,270
become efficient with repeated counting of
small numbers.

78
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,790
And that lulls them into a sense of
security.

79
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,330
And they come to believe that math is
about counting very precisely.

80
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,604
Unfortunately as time goes on,

81
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:06,420
the low achieving students only have these
counting strategies.

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,215
And the counting gets ever more complex as
problems become more difficult.

83
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:15,460
And low achievers also are often
identified as low achieving in school.

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,146
And the help that they get then often get
is more procedures more emphasis on

85
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:27,350
During procedure very carefully rather
than being taught to use numbers flexibly.

86
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,940
And that's probably the very, very last
thing that they need.

87
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,175
So part of the seriousness of the problem
is this.

88
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,810
Mathematics is a conceptual subject.

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,795
It's not just a series of procedures and
methods although many people thing it is.

90
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:44,623
For example, if we think of the hierarchy
of concepts in early number,

91
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:48,830
we know that students start by learning to
count.

92
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,720
And that helps them to develop the concept
of sum.

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,290
Then they work on counting on.

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,140
And that helps them to get the concept of
addition.

95
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,264
And when they work with a repeated
edition,

96
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:05,170
that helps them develop the concept of a
product.

97
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,943
So when we learn mathematics we engage in
a process in our

98
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:10,570
brain that's called compression.

99
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,665
And this is how it works, when we learn
new material, it takes up a big space in

100
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,785
our brain so If I was to teach you some
new mathematics now,

101
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:20,775
you would be thinking about how it works,
where it fits,

102
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:28,123
how it fits with other methods, so it
takes up a very large space.

103
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:32,210
But if I were, if you were to use some
early mathematics now, such as addition,

104
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,560
you would probably just very quickly be
able to recall and use that.

105
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,284
That addition is not taking a big space in
your brain, it's compressed.

106
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:48,620
And this is William Thurston he was a, a,
his field medal winner in mathematics.

107
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,820
And this is him talking about compression.

108
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,310
He says, mathematics is amazingly
compressible.

109
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,022
You may struggle a long time, step by
step, to work through the same process or

110
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:01,680
idea from several approaches.

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,580
But once you really understand it, and
have the mental perspective to see it as

112
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,680
a whole, there is often a tremendous
mental compression.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,338
You can file it away, recall it quickly
and completely when you need it, and

114
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:18,890
use it as just one step in some other
mental process.

115
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,898
And the insight that goes with this
compression is one of

116
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,515
the real joys of mathematics.

117
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,075
But here's the problem,

118
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:33,190
students who don't engage in conceptual
thinking don't benefit from compression.

119
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,957
So we can represent compression,

120
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:38,605
the compression that goes on in the brain
as a kind of triangle in this way,

121
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:44,600
with the space that's taken up with new
mathematics at the top of the triangle.

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,032
But for students who don't see mathematics
conceptually, for

123
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:52,454
them it's less of a triangle and more like
a never ending ladder that stretches up

124
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:57,770
to the sky with method upon method upon
method.

125
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,070
So they're not thinking in mathematics
conceptually,

126
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,190
instead they are thinking of lots of lots
of different methods to remember.

127
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,610
And so they're not engaging in this
process of compression.

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,064
So in mathematics education and policy
documents, people have for

129
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:16,412
a long time, talked about procedural
methods and conceptual ideas, that,

130
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:21,960
maths is made up of these two kind of
areas, with a big divide between the two.

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,150
So, people talk about, it's either
conceptual, or it's procedural.

132
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,078
But Carolyn Kieran's done some really
interesting work,

133
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,664
which has shown that actually,

134
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:35,584
we need to use mathematics conceptually
even when we are just learning procedures.

135
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:38,980
Because every time you need to use a
procedure.

136
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Every time you need to adapt a procedure
you engage in conceptual thinking.

137
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,349
So those distinctions between the two are
probably not even that helpful.

138
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,800
So, we have, what people think of now as
an algebra crisis in the US.

139
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,968
Everybody's worried, that large numbers of
students are failing algebra, and

140
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:02,240
that Algebra is maybe, just too difficult,
or too hard.

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
But one of the main reasons students are
failing algebra,

142
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,180
is the lack of foundational mathematics.

143
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,135
Particularly number sense.

144
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:15,087
So, it's very difficult for students to
learn Algebra if they,

145
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:21,100
they've missed out on a foundation or
understanding of early number.

146
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,160
And they've missed out on developing
number sense.

147
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
So, one of the people I interviewed for

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,734
this course was a very interesting person,
Sebastian Thrun.

149
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,310
He's achieved many things.

150
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,170
He's a Stanford professor, a
vice-president of Google, and he

151
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,130
was the one who designed the self driving
car and Google Glass and other things.

152
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,110
And he's now the CEO of Udacity.

153
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,940
And I interviewed him about his use of
mathematics.

154
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,598
And I'm going to show you more of the
interview in the next session, but He,

155
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:52,669
when, when he reflects on his work and
talks about various things he's done but,

156
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:56,445
one of the interesting parts was, he
talked about how everything he's done in

157
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,395
his work, including wiring complex
mathematics papers and

158
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:05,125
using a lot of high-level mathematics.

159
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,360
>> Comes down to an understanding of
numbers.

160
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,690
He talks about addition in particular, and
how everything else falls into place.

161
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,595
So, this is a short extract that I'd like
you to watch and listen to now.

162
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,900
>> I think everyone who works exercises
math everyday, in, in the way we operate.

163
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,016
We, we think about time everyday, we think
about money,

164
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:27,910
we think about relationships of people How
they interact with each other.

165
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,780
We think about tasks, about things we have
to do, about deadlines.

166
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,620
These are all mathematical examples.

167
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,164
And if you step a step further, there's
more contrived example,

168
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,570
like financing of your house and so on.

169
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,550
They were a little more difficult to
manipulate, but

170
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,840
even there we can get an intuition of, of
what's going on.

171
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,410
And they're mathematical.

172
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,000
I actually believe that somewhat
everything in Math is addition.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,794
Almost everything can be derived back to
very,

174
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:51,630
very simple operations like putting
numbers together.

175
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,950
It's the core of, of all mathematics.

176
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,550
I'm saying this, I've written a fairly
abstract math book full of formulas and

177
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,230
formulas and formulas I think you would
like your head would smoke seeing all

178
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,270
the formulas and still everything in there
is just basically addition.

179
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,910
So I think the key thing is not to be
afraid of the formulas.

180
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,090
The format is just a language.

181
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,333
The key thing is to grasp the concepts and
understand where they apply.

182
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,871
The key thing is to understand that
certain roles apply regardless of

183
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:20,490
the context, for example adding apples as
to as adding pears.

184
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,560
And once this abstraction is done between.

185
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,427
An instantiation of a concept that might
involve time or space or people,

186
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:29,764
to another instantiation, you already have
the basic math skill, which is the idea to

187
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:33,007
abstract, the idea that there's rules that
transcend beyond a certain domain, and

188
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:36,620
simple rules are very powerful.

189
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,320
Complicated rules are not very powerful in
my opinion.

190
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,770
There are simple rules.

191
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,172
So rules that say we can add numbers and
we can keep track of them there's some

192
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:46,250
sort of constancy to certain things like
the way space evolves and so

193
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,278
on, are really powerful.

194
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,238
>> So what I'd like you to do now is think
a bit about what we've seen so

195
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:56,440
far and what you've heard.

196
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,181
And answer this question.
