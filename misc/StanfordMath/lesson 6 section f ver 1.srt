1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,890
So, here's what I learned, from
interviewing the five people.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,398
What became clear to me, from all the
interviews, and

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:09,205
I didn't show you, all the parts where
this came up.

4
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:12,173
Was the reason these people were highly
successful math users,

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,810
comes from two things.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,035
It comes from knowledge and understanding
of maths.

7
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,895
But just as importantly it comes from a
relationship with that

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:24,385
maths knowledge that's different to a
relationship many people have.

9
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:28,400
And I'm going to call that an inquiry
relationship.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,440
So whats in and inquiry relationship?

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,280
Both Michelle and Sebastian talked about
using intuition.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,039
Sebastian was very strong and very
reflective about that which was helpful.

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,480
Saying he could never work on math without
intuition.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,554
And he gave specific examples of using
intuition to solve problems in

15
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:51,606
his robotics work, which obviously led to
the design of this self-driving car.

16
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,100
Which you probably know about.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,211
Sophie talks in these under the clips,
about having a feeling for math and

18
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,350
a connection to it.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,280
That's important to her, in allowing her
to use it.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,170
And Emily talked about curiosity.

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,854
Chris outlined the inquiry relationship
very well,

22
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:11,450
saying that those who have it display
courage.

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,178
Courage to think, if I interact with these
people and

24
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:17,400
I use resources, I can solve any problem.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,492
And Chris talked about his work involving
new problems that no

26
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:24,630
one has ever solved be, before.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,720
Today, we'll talk about an approach to
maths,

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,405
a relationship with mathematical knowledge
that comes into play whenever they

29
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:33,990
interact with maths in their lives and
jobs.

30
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,078
And what's significant to me is that
they're talking about math's use,

31
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,609
not in terms of knowledge they use.

32
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,570
But about this relationship they have with
the knowledge and understanding.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,560
So we all know or have known people who
have this inquiry relationship with math.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Hopefully you have this relationship.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,573
It's about being curious.

36
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:58,900
Making conjectures, not worrying about
uncertainty or mistakes.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,770
It's about using intuition.

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,120
It's about approaching math as a world of
exciting inquiry.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,920
And being confidently, you can solve any
problem.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,740
That relationship is to do with maths
knowledge, it isn't unrelated but

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,530
it is something very different from
knowledge.

42
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,340
Lots of people have a lot of maths
knowledge without that relationship.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,097
Some people, particularly young children,
have that relationship without any or

44
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,810
much maths knowledge.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,040
And I strongly contend that an inquiry
relationship with maths is what is

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,620
needed to work successfully in today's
world.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,720
So I'd like you to write down what kind of
relationship with maths would you

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,450
like your own students or children to
develop?

49
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,730
What features does it have?

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,960
What do they look like when they play out?

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,391
So write about that for me to read.

52
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:49,891
