1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,008
So, the function you just worked on is one
of linear growth.

2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:09,454
And if we look at a table of the values,
or we plot the values on a graph,

3
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:15,790
we can see that the growth is constant and
the graph is linear.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,104
I don't ask students to make tables and

5
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:22,948
plot graphs, as it leads them to look down
a table and work out a pattern, and

6
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:25,862
make [INAUDIBLE] make it into an algebraic
expression,

7
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:32,109
with really little understanding of what
that expression means.

8
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:37,277
instead, this this article which is really
great, I recommend reading it,

9
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:42,040
shows the way two people saw it visually.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,833
The people who arrived at the algebraic
generalization in

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,170
this way can also tell you what that n
represents,

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,050
whereas those who work it out from a table
usually can't do that.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,255
Not surprisingly, as they haven't had the
opportunity to see the n visually.

14
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,499
And so, in this case, you'll notice that,

15
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:03,930
that n doesn't represent one single
number, it represents any case number.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,820
So, in procedural algebra, the answers are
numbers.

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,240
In structural algebra, students are
learning to work with and represent, and

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,840
act on algebraic symbols.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,630
And the result is an, another algebraic
expression.

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,718
So, when I say act on,

21
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:27,080
I mean things like simplifying, factoring,
finding equivalence and so on.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,580
So, students start algebra usually finding
a single value x or for n.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,071
A lot of times, so, they get a lot of
practice and that, and

24
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:38,251
then they move to the more important work
in algebra, where the x or the n,

25
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:42,480
or whatever the variable represents any
number.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,340
This is a huge conceptual shift, and

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
it's not surprising that many students get
stuck in the first idea.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
So, the research in algebra tells us that
students should start algebra with

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,325
exploration of patterns, leading to
structural algebra and

30
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:02,330
variables representing a single number
that can vary, not a single solution.

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,294
Finding, using situations where there's
one single solution can be

32
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:10,630
introduced later when students have
learned about the main ideas in algebra.

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,654
So, these are two very different ways of
working, and

34
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:16,610
they develop two mindsets around algebra
and what algebra is.

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,660
The one we want and we desperately need
kids to develop is a generalizing mindset.

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,730
And that comes from work in structural
algebra.

37
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,930
But most school textbooks start students
in procedural algebra with lots of

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,870
solving for x.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,056
Not only does this lead students away from
a generalizing mindset, but

40
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:37,910
it's deadly boring often and meaningless
for most students.

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,387
Instead of sending them down that
unhelpful pathway from the beginning,

42
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,522
we urgently need to start students on a
path of generalization and

43
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:50,110
relationship exploration through rich and
engaging problems.

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,320
So, to illustrate the difference, try
these two questions.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,390
Here's the standard way students were
introduced to algebra.

46
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,870
Evaluate the following expression for the
given values, 4x plus 1,

47
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,022
when x equals 1, x equals 2, x equals 3.

48
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:10,570
Or, we have a different question, describe
how the shape is growing.

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,350
Can you use x to represent the number of
blocks at any stage?

50
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,890
Now, that second example may take slightly
longer, but it's all about connections and

51
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,160
a meaningful understanding of algebra.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,832
Students need that extra time to
understand generalization and

53
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:32,910
to start on a path which will take them to
calculus and beyond the college.

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,997
[UNKNOWN] administered an assessment to
see whether students could use

55
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:43,260
algebraic letters as a generalized case
after they had learned algebra.

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,811
And what he found was, 73% of 13 year
olds, 59% of 14 year olds, and

57
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:52,525
53% of 15 year olds, could only treat
letters as a particular number.

58
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,535
So, they got stuck in the procedure,

59
00:03:54,535 --> 00:04:00,130
procedural algebra that there were
introduced to at the beginning.

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,720
So, why do students find it so hard to
move past this?

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,380
It's not because they're not capable of
generalization.

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,380
And John Mason, who is a great writer
always he and his colleagues put it well.

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,711
They say, expressing generality is
entirely natural, pleasurable, and

64
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:19,299
part of human sense making.

65
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,170
They also state that every learner who
starts school has

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,910
already displayed the power to generalize
and abstract from particular cases.

67
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,120
And that is the root of algebra.

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,306
So, the classic procedural introduction to
algebra has a big impact on

69
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,010
students' thinking.

70
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,475
And the lack of teaching of generalization
through exploration means that

71
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:45,990
students are immediately led to miss the
point often.

72
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,422
Carolyn Kieran found that when students
were asked to express the meaning of a +

73
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,710
3, they couldn't, because there is no
equal sign, and

74
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,520
no number on the other side.

75
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,844
So, as an illustration of what they hope
students would see that,

76
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:07,673
try yourself think of a real situation
that can be represented by a + 3.
