1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,660
So this is what they make me think about.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,108
I was in a high school geometry class
recently in California,

3
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:09,430
in a great school with lots of great
teachers and ideas.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,442
But, as the teacher tried to get students
to reproduce the exact accurate words on

5
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,995
the next line of the proof.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,417
I just wondered at how the students could
make sense of this in terms of

7
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,830
their lives outside the classroom.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,110
Where very little depends on the precise
adjustment of a single word.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,119
Of course, precise wording is important in
mathematics, but

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,540
it seems high school geometry classes are
about little else.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,020
And their far from that exciting mode of
time and

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,460
space in geometry in action that Sebastian
and Sophie described.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,816
And for Sophie the fact that her geometry
class was so removed from the world was

14
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:52,040
the reason she felt forced to both suspend
reality and disengage from maths.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,706
This reminds me of a great quote by a
sociologist and

16
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:57,191
newspaper writer Hilary Rose.

17
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,601
Who recalls that as a young child she
loved to explore patterns and

18
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:03,160
numbers and shapes.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,860
But has sense of mathematical wonder ended
in school.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,550
And this is what she said.

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,648
Thinking about it, it was those so

22
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:14,120
called practical problems that irritated
me the most.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,970
It was obvious to me that many of the
questions simply indicated that

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,870
the questioner did not know enough about
the craft skills involved in

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,030
real world solutions.

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,797
Lawn rollers being pulled up slopes,

27
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:28,469
wallpapering rooms by calculating square
feet and inches.

28
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,550
These were tedious and as far as that
highly practical child could see, stupid.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,520
I knew that the price I paid was to lose
my sense of confidence that

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,410
school maths and everyday maths were part
of one world.

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,292
I haven't talked, in this course much
about the difference between

32
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:51,492
questions that really are in the world and
involve the world, and are great.

33
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:55,150
And those that I would call pseudo context
such as those that are used in

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,265
most word problems.

35
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,921
Where people are meant to read the words
but

36
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,210
not really engage with them as though they
are real.

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,420
And they fill Maths textbooks.

38
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,996
But I have a paper written just on that
which is in the references and

39
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,730
a chapter of my book.

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,198
And Dan Meyers' website has hosted a
discussion around these

41
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,525
pseudo-context problems.

42
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:19,230
As well as how to redesign tasks and
modelling tasks using multimedia.

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,930
So these links are all good resources for
those.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,611
So I think its important to reflect on the
geometry of time,

45
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:30,865
space, light, film making and so much
more.

46
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,936
And to replace the artificial unreal world
of geometry classes with one that's all

47
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:36,485
about life.

48
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:40,069
So that's my thought about geometry's role
in transforming students' maths

49
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,280
experiences for the better.

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,710
I know we would need a whole course to
work out how to do that and we,

51
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,100
you need a lot of time to work on how to
do that.

52
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,796
The same is true for Algebra and for the
number work but, as this course is about,

53
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:57,058
hopefully, sparking ideas and empowering
you to make those changes.

54
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,350
Hopefully these are helpful.

55
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,290
And here's another idea or really, a
research finding,

56
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,847
to really provide students with maths that
represents the world.

57
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:09,615
We should be separating Algebra and
Geometry.

58
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,155
This is really a conversation for

59
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:15,710
the US viewers, because the US is the only
country I know of that does this.

60
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,900
Maybe there are others, but in the US,
students take a year of Algebra,

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,110
then a year of Geometry when they forget
most of the Algebra.

62
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,038
Then a year of advanced Algebra that
spends a big time in that course going

63
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,690
back over the Algebra from the first
course.

64
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,265
I found it hard when I first moved to the
US to even know where some important and

65
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,310
really good topics and

66
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,990
problems would fit between, with within
these artificial distinctions.

67
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,480
And the distinctions certainly don't
represent the world.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,210
Two studies have been conducted recently
with large numbers of students, and

69
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,610
one study by Degross and colleagues, they
studies 2,161 students.

70
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,350
Half of them went to the traditional US
approach of Algebra, Geometry.

71
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,590
And half of them went through an approach
where the subjects were taught

72
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,550
together that they're starting to call the
international approach in the U.S.

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,560
In a second study James Tar and colleagues
studied 3,258 students also.

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,660
In the traditional approach and the
international approach.

75
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,900
In both studies the students working with
the integrated curriculum of

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,654
the international approach scored
significantly higher on

77
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:23,840
every achievement measure that was given
to them.

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,610
And those studies are also in the
references.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
So, we've talked about many different
ideas in this course,

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,620
we'll I've talked about them hopefully you
have talked some to.

81
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,690
And now I'd like us to stop and reflect on
those ideas.

82
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,660
I have two questions for you that I'm
very, very interested in the results of.

83
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,934
So, this could take awhile but,

84
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:46,930
please complete the questions carefully,
they could really help.

85
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,270
Students and and teachers and parents.

86
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,025
So the first big question is to think
about the student course that I'm

87
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:57,290
going to release directly to students.

88
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,790
And think which of the ideas we've talked
about would be useful for them.

89
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,910
So I'm going to show you the main ideas of
the course and ask you to vote for those

90
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,670
that you think would be most useful for
students and make comments if you wish.
