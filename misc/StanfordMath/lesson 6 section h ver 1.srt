1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,300
I think that for students in today's
traditional math classrooms it's

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,630
really hard to stay curious.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,270
How can you be mathematically curious when
all you're doing is having to

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,050
remember lists of methods?

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,030
That's really very hard.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,849
But curiosity is a natural quality of
people that should be nurtured from birth,

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,650
nurtured mathematically.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,329
But it disappears from students in math
classrooms, and

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,290
they really get the idea that there's no
roll for curiosity, only for answers.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,988
So in my thinking about these parts of the
mathematical inquiry relationship we

11
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:35,333
want students to have, I see some
interesting interrelationships.

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,298
So even though some scholars have
contrasted intuition with understanding,

13
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:43,141
my work that I'm doing with these
high-level math issues shows me intuition

14
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:50,020
and understanding are interrelated in very
interesting and important ways.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,520
Raymond Wilder, an American mathematician
and topologist I think, agrees.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,780
He points out that without intuition,
there's no creativity in mathematics.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,356
But also that the intuitive component is
dependent for

18
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:05,040
its growth on the knowledge component.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,675
And that really fits with the people I've
been interviewing who's

20
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,680
intuition clearly grew out of
understandings.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,159
And then their understandings grew out of
the intuition.

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,702
The mathematician's Burton interview
linked interestingly with

23
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,874
mathematical connections suggesting that
intuition really draws from

24
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,660
mathematical connections.

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,460
And those are often missed in classrooms
as well.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,534
It may be that students' lack of connected
awareness of math and

27
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:35,188
lack of opportunities to work on the
connections partly prevents their

28
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,058
development of intuition.

29
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:44,120
So there's an important iterative process
in understanding and intuition.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,031
And I would say that there's a kind of
helix.

31
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,655
Related to that also is mathematical
curiosity,

32
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,400
something with such inherent value.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,729
Everyone agrees that curiosity is a
wonderful thing.

34
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,033
But, I don't think [INAUDIBLE]
mathematical curiosity remains in

35
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:03,180
students, if they don't feel good about
themselves in maths.

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,410
I'm going to play you another short
extract from one of my students Sammy.

37
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,460
She didn't know at all that I was
interested in, or

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,469
would be talking about curiosity in this
course.

39
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:16,010
But when we interviewed her, she talked
about how her curiosity ended.

40
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,042
>> I think, that if, if somebody could,
given me positive feedback about math or

41
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:24,011
said, you're good at math or you can do
this, that I think my experience would

42
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:28,610
have been a little bit different because I
remember before that testing debacle in,

43
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,634
in fourth grade, I remember being so
curious about why

44
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:39,117
a square was a rectangle, but a rectangle
wasn't a square.

45
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,204
And really caring about those sorts of
problems, and then,

46
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:48,195
as soon as people start telling you, math
isn't your thing, then, it's all downhill.

47
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:52,800
>> In the first class, I shared that very
few students feel good about maths.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,820
And one of the teachers in our teaching
program at Stanford recently concluded,

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,480
after one year of teaching, that math has
beaten my students down really,

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,005
really badly.

51
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,920
And I know exactly what she means.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,395
Of course it isn't math per se,

53
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:11,590
that's beaten the students down, it's
their experiences in math in school.

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,010
And that suppresses curiosity.

55
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,968
So I really see two kind of interrelating
helixes, understanding and

56
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:20,940
intuition on the one hand, competence and
curiosity on the other.

57
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,002
There are a number of components of an
inquiry relationship that

58
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:29,703
students need that are separate from the
knowledge we focused on for decades.

59
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:33,042
But it is clear to me that there were two
parts to mathematical competency in

60
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:36,705
today's world, knowledge and an inquiry
relationship.

61
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:39,225
So now I'd like you to choose a word that
represent, for

62
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:44,530
you, the most important aspect of the
relationship you think students need.

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,365
It might be one of the words we've talked
about, like inquiry or curiosity or

64
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,490
maybe a different one.

65
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,690
Choose the one that's most important for
you and

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,290
when we get some responses, we'll show you
a word cloud.

67
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:04,806
