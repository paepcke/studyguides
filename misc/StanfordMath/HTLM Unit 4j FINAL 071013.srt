1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,377
So I know the idea that we need students
in different groups is very deep in US,

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:08,330
UK, and possibly other cultures.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,546
And changing the heterogeneous grouping
requires big changes in teaching, but

4
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:14,522
if we keep telling students that they're,
that they're not good in maths or

5
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:17,594
that they have the math gift, it's really
going to be hard to break the cycle of

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:22,360
failure that we see in these and other
countries.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,470
[MUSIC].
So the final piece is around messages.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,364
Teachers and parents give messages to
students all of the time about mindsets,

9
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:36,196
and in the first session we saw the power
of one sentence in

10
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:40,220
changing student's learning trajectories.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,685
You, you remember that's saying that I'm
giving you this feedback because I

12
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:47,800
believe in you and how that's changed the
student's learning.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,700
Now teachers and parents can give messages
very explicitly by designing a lesson or

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,890
a conversation, and they can also give
them constantly as they interact.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,555
So what I want to do now,

16
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,300
I'm going to show you the rest of the
interview I did with Carol Dweck.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,760
It's about eight minutes long.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,698
There's a lot in there to think about, and

19
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,289
as it's the end of this session, the final
task that I want to give you is to

20
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:14,900
really think about what you heard in the
lesson and from Carol.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,086
And design something different you're
going to do with your students,

22
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:21,290
school students or your own children.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,920
So think of ways to communicate positive
messages about growth mindset.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,932
Maybe in your first class,

25
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:30,880
maybe it's something that will go through
your teaching with them.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,590
Be creative.

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,446
Don't just think of things to say, there
might be a really good way to

28
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:38,260
get that information across, maybe a video
or an activity.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,040
And I want, I want everyone to do is to
write down their ideas in a paragraph or

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,340
two and then those will be sent out and
you will get back three other

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,460
people's idea, so you can look and comment
on those.

32
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,119
And I'm also giving you, some resources
for great websites on, teaching for

33
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,020
a growth mindset.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,140
So, I look forward to seeing you in the
next session.

35
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,955
>> When students are in a fixed mindset,
where everything and everybody is judging

36
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:16,435
how smart they are they see effort and
difficulty as meaning they're dumb.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,258
But when they're in a growth mindset,

38
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:25,370
they come to understand that effort and
difficulty.

39
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,060
These are the times that they're getting
smarter.

40
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,888
These are the times that their brains are
growing new connections and

41
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:35,890
they're really, really learning.

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:45,558
We have a long line of research showing
that the self-esteem movement was wrong.

43
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:49,873
Praising kids' intelligence and talent is
harmful.

44
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:55,873
It puts them in a fixed mindset, it makes
them afraid of difficult tasks,

45
00:02:55,873 --> 00:03:04,335
it makes them less resilient and less
persistent when they hit errors.

46
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:06,671
They only care about looking smart and

47
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,750
never doing anything that would contradict
that.

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,672
Parents think the greatest gift they can
give to kids is this gift of

49
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:18,142
praising intelligence.

50
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:20,150
It isn't.

51
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,681
It saddles them with a big liability.

52
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:28,580
Instead, what should you do?

53
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,859
Praise the child's process, the strategies
they, they use, the effort they put in,

54
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:42,360
the persistence they show, their focus on
doing the problem.

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,810
This gives them a growth mindset.

56
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,350
[COUGH] And it tells them what they can do
when they're struggling.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,700
Those same things, it tells them how to
overcome obstacles,

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,820
not just why they succeeded but what they
can do to be successful in the future.

59
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,230
This is the greatest gift we can give to
kids.

60
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,463
We published a study recently showing that
mothers praise to

61
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:13,443
their babies one to three years of age
predicted the child's mindset and

62
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:19,050
desire for challenge five years later.

63
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,558
So that praise is powerful.

64
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:28,251
Recently, Stephanie Freiburg, a professor
at the University of Illinois did a big

65
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:34,847
growth mindset intervention at a Native
American Reservation where she grew up,

66
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:44,610
actually the whole school was transformed
in terms of the growth mind set.

67
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,680
Kids were asked to spend and

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,142
required to spend six hours a day in
school growing their brains.

69
00:04:53,142 --> 00:05:02,250
And the, the educators explain that it's
because we care about you.

70
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,692
We want you to have six hours a day
growing your brain.

71
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:13,212
The younger grades, after one to one and a
half years of that growth minds

72
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:19,468
that message, went from the bottom of the
district to near the top of the district,

73
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:28,340
in terms of their reading readiness, and
reading Ccmprehension.

74
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,280
The higher grades gain substantially in
reading and math, but

75
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,570
it wasn't just a growth mind set message.

76
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,220
It was a growth mind set message that was
tailored to the communal values of

77
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,455
that culture.

78
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:49,991
So they weren't just told that they could
grow their intelligence,

79
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:53,636
they were told they could grow their
intelligence and

80
00:05:53,636 --> 00:06:01,950
thereby help their families and their
communities better in the future.

81
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,590
So originally, the students were told,
listen,

82
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,320
you can get smarter, but in that culture
it wasn't an inherent value.

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,565
In a lot of mainstream culture you tell
kids you can get smarter and

84
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:18,460
they are riveted.

85
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,880
They're thrilled, they're in, but here,
it's really it was

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,970
a really strong value on helping your
family and contributing to your culture.

87
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,026
And when the growth mindset was framed in
terms of getting smarter in order to

88
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:42,230
contribute more to your family and
culture, it really took off.

89
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,470
Recently we did an intervention with the
Kahn Academy.

90
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,125
This was led by one of our graduate
students, Dave Panesku,

91
00:06:54,125 --> 00:07:01,060
where before each fractions problem, kids
received either the standard kind academy,

92
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:09,010
no, nothing before the problem or a growth
mindset message.

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,780
Remember, the harder you work, the smarter
you get in math.

94
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,492
Or remember, when you work hard to solve
this problems your math grain,

95
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,830
brain will grow.

96
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,790
We also had a third group that received
encouraging statements.

97
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,770
Like this one's hard, do your best, or if
at first you don't succeed, try again.

98
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,250
Now that may sound a lot like growth
mindset, but

99
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:45,600
just exhorting kids to try is not the same
as teaching them that when they try.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,550
They grow their math brains and become
better at math problems.

101
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,960
So, what happened?

102
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,381
First, we found that when the growth
mindset message was

103
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:05,910
before each fraction problem, the students
solved more problems.

104
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,810
Than the kids in the other two groups.

105
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,951
The encouragement alone did not do better
than nothing.

106
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:18,115
Also that improvement in a number of
problems solved continued on future units,

107
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:26,540
where they were no longer receiving those
growth mindset statements.

108
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,562
Also, the students who received the growth
mindset statements,

109
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:39,340
mastered many more, or significantly more
units after that fractions unit.

110
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,165
Even though they were no longer getting
that growth mindset message.

111
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:50,720
So, it means that the message that working
hard at math grows your math brain.

112
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,151
Not that it means you're dumb like in a
fixed mind set, but

113
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:57,870
it grows your math brain.

114
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,434
Teachers and parents should spend time
listening to

115
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:06,310
the fixed mind set messages they have in
their head.

116
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,016
The things they tell themselves about
themselves,

117
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,750
they things they're thinking about kids.

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,105
Don't get defensive, we all have those
thoughts, but start to hear them.

119
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:22,672
Don't evaluate them, just start to hear
them, and

120
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:29,280
eventually start talking back to the with
growth-mindset messages.

121
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,714
But it's very, very important to
understand,

122
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:38,818
we all have some fixed-mindset ideas, and
we need to be aware of them in

123
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:47,230
order to change our talk and practice to
truly reflect a growth mindset.

124
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,730
