1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,919
So last year I taught a Freshman seminar
at Stanford.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,720
It was called, How do People learn Math?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,470
So, in the description I said, we were
going to look at why math is so

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,700
traumatic for people, why is it so
inequitable?

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,886
I had 15 slots, but I got about 70
applications from students, and

6
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:17,895
Reading those applications, all from
Stanford students was

7
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:22,350
amazing because they all wrote pretty much
the same thing.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,580
That I used to be great at maths, I used
to love maths until dot, dot, dot.

9
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,799
And you can see some of their words here.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,710
Those dot dot dots are what I want to talk
to you about in this class.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,486
I'm now going to play you some brief, very
brief, video reflections on maths,

12
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:51,506
just from around six Stanford freshmen.

13
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:52,700
So they're each very short.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,900
But you're going to get some different
ideas from these clips from the students.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,530
And at the end I want you to make, a kind
of concept map of the ideas.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,420
What were the big ideas you heard?

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,560
Maybe you put big ideas in one space.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
And smaller ideas coming off those.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,809
If you're going to draw a concept map, you
need to take a photo of it and

20
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,420
upload it to send it in.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,130
If you can't or don't want to do that, you
can just write the ideas in the text box.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,406
And if you don't know what a concept map
is, here's one on a totally unrelated

23
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:25,790
topic just to show how different ideas
relate in one of those.

24
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:34,188
For high school it was mostly just like, I
would've thinked like, basically for

25
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:39,240
the most part they gave you the formulas,
and you just have to plug that in.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,261
>> For me at least, I always had trouble
with math in the sense that,

27
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:46,137
it never quite reached me, I always found
there was a disconnect in the classroom,

28
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:51,740
for example Why would someone go to the
store and buy 300 apples?

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,700
I would never do that.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,740
So I would always think of math as like,
this fairy tale land.

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,611
Which I would never use.

32
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:00,290
So I think that there's a pretty big
disconnect for me.

33
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,470
At least in that sense.

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,010
I was kind of, discouraged as a kid,
growing up.

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,999
>> Now when I think about math, I kind of
cringe and

36
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,030
feel anxiety just thinking about.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,802
Those feelings I felt when trying to do
that math this quarter.

38
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,018
So.

39
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,245
>> I hate it a lot.

40
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:19,032
It's boring and dry, and it's a lot of
work.

41
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:22,068
>> The first thing that comes to mind when
I

42
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:28,416
think of math is just a series of formulas
and equations.

43
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,425
>> I feel very stupid, like I don't
belong.

44
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:35,090
>> And that academic world, when I think
about math,

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,705
it basically drives me away from pursuing
higher education.

46
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,929
>> So the class I taught to the Stanford
freshman was a kind of intervention to

47
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,780
change their relationship with math.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,085
So that class gave me the idea for putting
a similar class online.

49
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,741
So, what are the reasons for

50
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:55,210
the big problems we have in maths
education and beyond?

51
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,744
Because, I say beyond, the problems don't
stay in classrooms poor math

52
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:02,791
performance really predicts desperate
shortages for the future for the numbers

53
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:08,327
who can work in science, innovation
technology, [UNKNOWN], and so on.

54
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:12,881
And we'll be going through some of these
reasons in the class generally, but

55
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,155
today I want to focus on these.

56
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,467
One, very big reason is the myths and
stereotypes that are in and

57
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,838
around mathematics education.

58
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,949
And in the [INAUDIBLE] version of this
course, this very first session is

59
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:31,570
going to be knocking down some of the
damaging myths that students suffer from.

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,060
So I think the most pervasive myth, and
damaging, is that.

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,440
Only some people can be good at maths.

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,601
That idea is absent in the more successful
countries in the world, such as Japan, and

63
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm going to show you how wrong that idea
is in sessions two and three.

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Another idea, girls have less potential to
do well in maths.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,220
I cannot count of the number of women who
tell me.

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,200
About somebody telling them, to be nice
and

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,030
to help them, maybe math isn't your thing.

68
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,592
You're good at other things.

69
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:09,072
Here's a couple of my standard students,
just relating, and talking about that,

70
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:13,128
the particular kind of messages that hurt
them.

71
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,820
>> I Think a lot of people said to me
>> Like we know math isn't your thing, but

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,696
that's okay because something else is your
thing.

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,934
And while that's true, I think personally,
it was pretty detrimental for

74
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:33,185
my experiences in math, especially in high
school.

75
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:38,690
>> Growing up it was always me in a class
full of a lot of males.

76
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,080
And so the teacher tended to favor these
students who were good.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,650
And so they didn't talk to me at all.

78
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,250
And when I looked at that.

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,240
When I looked at my sophomore, year, my
junior year.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,380
Just, being excluded.

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,560
Like, I wasn't worth talking to.

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
That felt the worst.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,770
And it just.

84
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,306
Totally was different from, like say,

85
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:59,430
an English course, where they would talk
to every student.

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,960
In like, my math courses, completely
ignored, and I just felt not important.

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,625
So, when I think about math, I generally
tend to think about my past experiences.

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,910
>> Especially my sophomore year in high
school, where I felt the lowest.

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,420
And it just totally drove me away from
pursuing anything in math.

90
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,480
I feel very dumb and like, inadequate when
I think about that topic.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,132
And I don't feel good enough.

92
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:27,190
>> So now I want to introduce you to one
of the first math users we have on video.

93
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,130
Sophie Constantino is a filmmaker.

94
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,390
And I met her when she came to film my
freshman class.

95
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,560
And she's the co founder of Citizen Film.

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,150
She's a documentary film director and
cinematographer.

97
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,958
And Sophie told me that she uses maths all
the time in her work, but

98
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,310
she used to hate it in school.

99
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,002
So we'll listen to Sophie now.

100
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:55,395
>> Probably my early math days I was.

101
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:59,491
You know, just slogging along trying to
figure it out and I got that sort of

102
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:03,459
message, well it's okay, girls aren't
really as good at math as boys are, so

103
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,310
you know, maybe you're just going to
struggle with that one.

104
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,874
>> And, and as a kid who thought I was
good at everything,

105
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:20,360
I think that was hard I wasn't You know I,
I'm not good at memorizing.

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,663
So once I had to do times tables you know,
I was, I was sort of,

107
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:25,160
doing the math backwards in my head.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,656
Cheating.
It's like, it's like,

109
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,210
memorizing Shakespeare.

110
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,190
It's like, why?

111
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,740
>> Mm hm.
>> I don't get it.

112
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,784
Is there a reason I'm doing this?

113
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:33,704
>> Yeah.

114
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,908
>> So I, you know, I sort of had a.

115
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:41,578
Resistance and frustration with that and I
think by the time I was yeah, fourth grade

116
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:50,200
I was you know good at English, not so
good at math and I sort of accepted that.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,147
I kind of want to blame it on my mother
but

118
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:56,960
I think that it was her way of sort of
empathizing with my struggles.

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,006
Like you know Don't worry it's, it's an,

120
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:02,940
you know, sometimes girls just aren't as
good at that.

121
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,330
>> Students experience racial stereotyping
too.

122
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,182
If you'll ask an American or a Latina or
Latino in today's schools it's very

123
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:12,650
likely that you're made to feel that you
can't perform well in math.

124
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,010
Those are negative and very harmful
stereotypes.

125
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,410
What are called positive stereotypes also
occur.

126
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,330
And put pressure on kids.

127
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,610
And have a negative impact.

128
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,280
As we'll hear about in a minute.

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,440
If you're Asian you may experience the
pressure to achieve highly in math.

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,020
Because you're expected to be naturally
good at it.

131
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,770
And those messages are also damaging.

132
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,088
So this is one of my students, KK.

133
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:37,215
An Asian-American student talking about
the negative effects of that stereotype.

134
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,554
>> When I was growing up, I was always
like, I'm Asian-American and

135
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:44,838
I suppose people would think that I'm good
at math in the terms of the classroom and

136
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:48,492
also the teachers, but I guess when I was
younger I was more hesitant to

137
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:55,553
fulfill the stereotype, so I wanted to be
the anti-stereotype.

138
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:58,780
>> So we've now heard four people talk
about messages they've received.

139
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,984
Three students and Sophie talked about it.

140
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,856
Messages in general about low achievement
and

141
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:07,160
messages that were related to gender and
race.

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,352
And I want to ask you the question now,
what do you think are similar or

143
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:13,544
different other negative messages that you
think students hear, or

144
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:16,918
maybe you heard as a learner?

145
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,840
It doesn't matter if the message is
similar to those you just heard.

146
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,050
I'd just like to hear about what damaging
messages are out there.

147
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,430
So I want you to write briefly about that,
couple of sentences at most.

148
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,716
And, you're going to be asked to look at
six other people's submissions and

149
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:34,678
your submission will be sent out too.

150
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:38,044
I'm not asking you to comment on other
people's submissions, just to seen them,

151
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:42,250
to get some sense of what's out there in
terms of these messages.
