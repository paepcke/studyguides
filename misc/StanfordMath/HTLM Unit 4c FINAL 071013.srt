1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,539
So, the big point is that tasks need to
give students the space to learn and

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:07,000
to see that maths means learning, not just
performing.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,270
So, what does that mean?

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,680
Even a small change can make that
difference.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,044
For example a really classic math problem
you'll see in textbooks is,

6
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:17,710
find the perimeter of this shape.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,094
Now, if we changed that question to can
you construct two

8
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,440
rectangles with a perimeter of 26?

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,416
We change completely what the students do
and

10
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,350
the first one, they're coming up with an
answer.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,747
And the second one, we're asking them to
make choices and

12
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,140
this invokes the thought process for
students.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,156
They also change from thinking, I'm
finding the answer, to I'm think,

14
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:39,930
learning and growing.

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,685
Even though this is assessing the exactly
same mathematics..

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,936
Now, I wouldn't say that finding two
rectangles with a certain area is

17
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,132
a great task by any means but

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:54,270
it illustrates the process of moving, from
performing to growing and thinking.

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,410
So here is a great task that can be very
different depending on how it's presented.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,748
And this illustrates my point as well I
think.

21
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:05,586
So first I'm going to present the task in
a way that is

22
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,100
oriented towards a growth mindset.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,014
So in this task I'm going to ask you to do
you're going to,

24
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:16,280
you'll see case one, two and three of a
shape growing.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,718
And my question for you that I want you to
think about and

26
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:22,100
write about is how do you see this shape
growing.

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
How would you describe the growth.
