00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,750
Welcome to class six.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,026
I'm excited to be continuing the theme of
the last session of what it means to

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:17,100
think and learn conceptually.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,486
And just as importantly,

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,770
what it means to develop a positive
relationship with maths.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,526
So, first of all, I'm going to give you
three problems to solve,

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,000
very typical math classroom problems.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,410
This is not any sort of test.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,752
It's, we don't need to know what you can
do on these.

11
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:35,392
But the reason for doing them is because
we're going to explore what's in

12
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,540
these problems, and how to think
conceptually about them.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,510
And if you haven't tried them, it's hard
to do that.

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,300
So, don't feel intimidated if you don't
know how to solve them.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,512
Just have a go,

16
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:56,585
remembering that mistakes

17
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:02,201
and struggle makes

18
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:11,748
your brains grow.
