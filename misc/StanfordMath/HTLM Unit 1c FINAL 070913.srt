1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,922
So last year I taught a freshmen seminar
at Stanford.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,720
It was called How Do People Learn Math.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,528
So in the description I said why we're
going to look at why maths is so

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,380
dramatic for people.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,700
Why it's so inequitable.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,219
I had 15slots but I got about 70
applications from students.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,931
And Reading those, applications all from
Stanford students was amazing because

8
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,251
they all wrote pretty much the same thing,
that,

9
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:27,580
I used to be great at maths, I used to
love maths, until dot dot dot.

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,799
And you can see some of their words here.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,495
And there is dot, dot, dots what I want to
talk to you about in this class I am

12
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:46,125
now going to play you some brief very
brief video reflection on maths just from,

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,205
from around six time professment so
they're very short, but

14
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:55,900
you're going to get some different ideas
from these clips from the students.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,530
And at the end I want you to make a kind
of concept map of the ideas.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,420
What were the big ideas you heard?

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,560
Maybe you put big ideas in one space and
smaller ideas coming off those.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,923
If you are going to draw a concept map,
you need to take a photo of it and

19
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:13,420
upload it to send it in.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,130
If you can't or don't want to do that, you
can just write the ideas in the text box.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,280
And if you don't know what a concept map
is, here's one on a totally unrelated

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,097
topic, just to show you how different
ideas are related in one of those.

23
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:31,725
>> For high school it was mostly just like
algorithmically like, basically for

24
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:39,265
the most part, they gave you the formulas
and you just had to plug that in.

25
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,063
>> For me, at least,

26
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:44,640
I always had trouble with math in the
sense that it never quite reached me.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,110
I always found there was a disconnect in
the classroom.

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,422
For example, why would someone go the
storm by 300 apples,

29
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,700
I would never do that.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,904
So I would always think of math as,

31
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:57,611
kind of like this fairy tale land which I
would never use.

32
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,726
so I think that there's a pretty big
disconnect for me,

33
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,470
at least, in that sense.

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,035
I was kind of discouraged as a kid growing
up.

35
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,159
>> Now when I think of math, I kind of
cringe and

36
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,050
just feel anxiety just thinking about

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,018
>> Those feelings I felt when trying to do
that math this quarter, so.

38
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,245
>> I hate it a lot.

39
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:19,045
It's boring and dry, and it's a lot of
work.

40
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:21,925
>> First thing that comes to mind when I

41
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:28,416
think of math is just a series of formulas
and equations.

42
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,425
>> I feel very stupid, like I don't
belong.

43
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,999
>> In that academic world when I think
about math,

44
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:39,705
it basically drives me away from pursuing
higher education.

45
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,855
>> So, the class I taught to the Stanford
freshman was a kind of intervention to

46
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,855
change their relationship with math, and
that class gave me the idea for

47
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,085
putting a similar class online.

48
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:53,045
So what are the reasons for the big
problems we have in math education and

49
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:58,580
beyond, because I say beyond, the problems
don't stay in classrooms.

50
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,140
Poor math performance predicts desperate
shortages for the future for the numbers

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,327
who can work in science, innovation,
technology, medicine and so on.

52
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:12,881
And we'll be going through some of those
reasons in the class generally, but

53
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,155
today I want to focus on these.

54
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,445
One very big reason is the myths and
stereotypes that are in and

55
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:24,470
around mathematics education.

56
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,572
And in the student version of this course,
this very first session is going to be

57
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:31,570
knocking down some of the damaging myths
that students suffer from.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,060
So, I think the most pervasive myth and
damaging, is that.

59
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,440
Only some people can be good at maths.

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,674
That idea is absent in the more successful
countries in the world, such as Japan, and

61
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm going to show you how wrong that idea
is, in sessions two and three.

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Another idea, girls have less potential to
do well in maths.

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,173
I cannot keep count of the number of women
who tell me About somebody telling them to

64
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,620
be nice and to help them.

65
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,030
Maybe math isn't your thing.

66
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,605
You're good at other things.

67
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,920
Here's a couple of my Stanford students
just relating and

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,128
talking about that the particular kind of
messages that hurt them.

69
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:19,220
>> So, I have, I had a really negative
math experience.

70
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,144
Mostly it started for me in fifth grade
when we were taking a standardized test

71
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,982
and the teacher accidentally gave me the
eighth grade version of the test and so

72
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:27,519
for three days I tested with the eighth
grade version of the test and

73
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,422
sort of that set me off and

74
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:34,095
I never really came back from it I think a
lot of people have said to me.

75
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,514
Look, we know math isn't your thing, but

76
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,987
that's okay because something else is your
thing.

77
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,769
Look, we know math isn't your thing, but

78
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,897
that's okay because something else is your
thing.

79
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:45,141
Look, we know math isn't your thing, but

80
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:49,120
that's okay because something else is your
thing.

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,240
>> And, while that's true, I think
personally it was pretty detrimental for

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,540
my Experiences in math, especially in high
school.

83
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,570
>> Growing up it was always me in a class
full of a lot of males and so the teacher

84
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,020
tended to favor the students who were good
and so they didn't talk to me at all.

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,776
And when I looked at that, when I looked
at my sophomore year and

86
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,793
my junior year I just.

87
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,224
>> Being excluded, like,
>> Hm.

88
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,492
>> I wasn't worth talking to, that felt
the worst, and

89
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,382
it just totally was different from, like,

90
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:25,820
say an English course where they would
talk to every student.

91
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,340
In, like, my math courses, completely
ignored, and I just felt not important.

92
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,300
So when I think about math, I generally
tend to think about my past experiences.

93
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,132
Especially my sophomore year in high
school where I felt the lowest and

94
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:42,780
it just totally drove me away from
pursuing anything in math.

95
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,143
I feel very dumb and like inadequate when
I think about that topic and

96
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,505
I don't feel good enough.

97
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:53,550
>> So, now I want to introduce you to one
of the first math users we have on video.

98
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,895
Sophie Constantano is a filmmaker and

99
00:05:55,895 --> 00:06:00,026
I met her when she came to film my
freshman class.

100
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,930
And she's the co-founder of Citizen Film.

101
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,500
She's a documentary film director and
cinematographer.

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,362
And Sophie told me that she uses math all
the time in her work, but

103
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:12,670
she used to hate in school.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,505
So we'll listen to Sophie now.

105
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,270
>> Probably my early math days I was You
know,

106
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,721
just slogging a long trying to figure it
out and I got that sort of message, well,

107
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:30,558
it's okay girls are really as good in, at
math as boys are.

108
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:34,320
So, you know, maybe you're just going to
struggle with that one and, and

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,233
as a kid who thought I was good at
everything, I, I think that was hard.

110
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,357
I wasn't You know, I'm, I'm not good at
memorizing, so

111
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,984
once I had to do times tables, you know, I
was,

112
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:52,010
I was sort of doing the math backwards in
my head, cheating.

113
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,160
It was like, like memorizing Shakespeare,
it's like why?

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,110
I don't get it?

115
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,049
Is there a reason I'm doing this?

116
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:03,429
So I, you know, I sort of had a resistance
and a frustration with that, and

117
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,495
I think by the time I was, yeah, fourth
grade, I was,

118
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:14,272
you know, good at English, not so good at
math, and I kind of accepted that.

119
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:18,248
>> Like I don't want to blame it on my
mother, but I think it was her way of

120
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:23,005
sort of empathizing with my struggle, is
like, you know, Don't worry it's, it's,

121
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:29,310
you know, sometimes girls just aren't as
good at that.

122
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,710
>> Students experience racial stereotyping
too.

123
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,608
If you're African American or Latina or
Latino in today's schools it's very

124
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:39,020
likely that you're made to feel that you
can't perform well in math.

125
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,370
Those are negative and very harmful
stereotypes.

126
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,653
What are called positive stereotypes also
occur and put pressure on kids and

127
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:49,630
have a negative impact, as we'll here
about in a minute.

128
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,544
If you're Asian you may experience the
pressure to achieve highly in math,

129
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,706
because you're expected to be naturally
good at it, and

130
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:58,130
those messages are also damaging.

131
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,570
So, this is one of my students, Kaykay,

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,530
an Asian american student talking about
the negative effects of that stereotype.

133
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,008
When I was growing up, I was, I'm always
like I'm Asian America and

134
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,884
I suppose people would think that I'm good
at math in the terms of the classroom and

135
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,734
which and also the teachers, but I guess
when I was younger, I

136
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:21,914
was more hesitant to fill the stereotype,
so I wanted to be the anti-stereotype.

137
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,046
>> So we've now heard four people talk
about messages they've received,

138
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,096
three students and Sophie talked about it
Messages in general about low achievement,

139
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:33,520
and messages related to gender and race.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,541
And I want to ask you the question now,
what do you think are similar or

141
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:41,380
different other negative messages that you
think students here?

142
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,256
Or maybe you heard as a learner?

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,428
It doesn't matter if the messages are
similar to those you've just heard,

144
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:51,410
I just like to hear about what damaging
messages are out there.

145
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,190
So I want you to write briefly about that.

146
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,790
A couple of sentences at most.

147
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,035
And you're going to be asked to look at
six other people's submissions and

148
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:01,023
your submission will be sent out too.

149
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,860
I'm not asking you to comment on other
people's submissions.

150
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,658
Just to see them,

151
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:08,610
to get some sense of what's out there in
terms of these messages.
