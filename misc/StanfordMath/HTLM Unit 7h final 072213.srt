1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:05,331
Now we're going to watch Cathy Humphries
teach this with her class of students.

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:06,734
Ans as you watch this video,

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:10,455
I'm going to ask you to reflect afterwards
when in this clip do you hear and

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:16,254
see mathematical wonder and curiosity and
appreciation from the students.

5
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:19,974
Where does it happen in the teaching?

6
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,710
>> Also, what teaching decisions did you
see Cathy make that

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,816
generated the student's interest and
engagement in this work?

8
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:36,816
[BLANK_AUDIO].

9
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:44,320
>> So, what I've got right here is a, is a
10 by 10 grid.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,264
And, what I'd like you to do mentally is
figure out without

11
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:57,553
counting one by one, how many squares are
in the colored in portion.

12
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,463
>> In what portion?

13
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:00,967
>> How many unit squares?

14
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:04,776
>> In where?

15
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:13,950
And without talking, without counting

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,325
one by one, stop writing.

17
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:22,874
Wow.

18
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,392
Lots of people have an idea.

19
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:27,042
Would you talk to each other just about
what you got?

20
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:29,957
[CROSSTALK]

21
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:38,977
Can I please have your attention?

22
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:44,269
>> [CROSSTALK]
By the way, what do,

23
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:51,577
do we all want to say the answer?

24
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,524
>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah!

25
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,183
>> Well how /g, what is it?

26
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,159
>> [CROSSTALK] 36!

27
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,197
>> 36 squares, but did anybody pick what
was maybe 40 first?

28
00:01:58,197 --> 00:01:59,422
>> [CROSSTALK] First?

29
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:04,307
'Kay, did anyone pick what was maybe 38
first?

30
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,506
A few people, okay.

31
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,552
And we.

32
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:10,371
So, when you talked it over in your group,
those of you who thought 40,

33
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,978
what were you thinking?

34
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,418
>> All right, Stephanie, what were you
thinking?

35
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,893
>> I was thinking that one side is tied,
and

36
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:21,247
there's 4 sides even, 5 times [INAUDIBLE]
is 40.

37
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,973
>> OK, how many were thinking just like
Stephanie?

38
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:27,171
>> All right, what about the 38 people,
what were you thinking?

39
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,015
>> Mindy.

40
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,599
>> I was thinking that the top 2 10 equals
10 which equals 20 out of the other two to

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,457
get where 9 is the [UNKNOWN] 18.

42
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,479
>> Aah.

43
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,748
Okay.

44
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:37,852
Alright.

45
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:40,063
So now let's just see some different
methods.

46
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,552
You know how we like to gather different
methods.

47
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:45,075
Let's see some different methods for
getting the 36.

48
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,237
So let's see.

49
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,412
Let's have Charmaine.

50
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:49,561
Charmaine what's your method?

51
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,090
Well [UNKNOWN] started out with 40
[UNKNOWN] 18 times 4.

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,508
And then I subtracted 4 from that because
there would be 4 squares overlapping.

53
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,878
And so that got 26.

54
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:07,696
>> Raise your hand if you understand how
and show me how you did it.

55
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,520
[NOISE] And the 4 was for.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,345
>> The four squares that overlap.

57
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:15,000
>> Okay, and this 4 was for?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,961
>> 4 sides.

59
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,769
>> And this 10 was for?

60
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,029
>> 10 squares on each side.

61
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,289
>> Okay.
Another way to do it?

62
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,127
Owen.
>> All right, how I got it was,

63
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:28,096
I just put one side was Obviously going to
be ten towards ten, and then, I did,

64
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:34,427
like the bottom one, and that was
[CROSSTALK] Could you go up and show us?

65
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,128
I think that might help us.

66
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,903
>> So I'll use a pointer finger as the
pen.

67
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:42,365
>> The pointer's in the top drawer if you
want to use it.

68
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,823
Top, cent, right center.

69
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,633
>> [NOISE] Oh, here it is.

70
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,362
>> There it is.

71
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,658
>> All right, I found it.

72
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:50,242
Anyway, so [NOISE] I like I know this has
10, so I just did like 10,

73
00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:56,212
and then this one, this one's the
overlapping one, so then this would be 9.

74
00:03:56,212 --> 00:04:00,502
Then this one would be nine too because
this one's overlapping but, and then for

75
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:04,727
this one it would be eight because these
two, this one is being used by this one,

76
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:09,359
and this one is being used by that one.

77
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,558
>> Colin, I really like.

78
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,750
>> What you showed visually what you did.

79
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,462
How many understood Colin's method?

80
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:19,222
Wow, great, okay, thank you.

81
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:22,534
How about a different method?

82
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,604
Wow, there's a lot.

83
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:29,848
Alright, let's see it's hard to choose,
Joe.

84
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,871
>> I I did.

85
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,229
The top.

86
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,587
The top.

87
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:38,793
>> When you go up like Colin did?

88
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:43,675
>> I added, I know that this one, this is
10 and so is that.

89
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,950
So I added those two.

90
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,882
And at first I thought this was like 9
right there so

91
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:49,920
I thought about it for a while.

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,685
And that's 8 and so I added those two and
that's.

93
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:58,438
16 and add it to 20.

94
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,091
>> [NOISE] So, Joseph look at this and

95
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,440
tell me if you think that represents what
you did.

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,096
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

97
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,392
And the 10 and the 10 stand for.

98
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,524
>> This one and this row right here.

99
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,984
How many boxes are in that row and
[INAUDIBLE] 10.

100
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,560
>> Okay.
How many unit squares are in the top and

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,229
here at the bottom, and then where'd you
get the eight?

102
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,832
>> like, this row, except it didn't have
listed.

103
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,040
>> How many understand Joseph's method?

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,404
All right.
Are there any other methods?

105
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,132
Oh, lots of people, but how many had Joe's
method that they wanted to explain?

106
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:22,820
A lot of people.

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,747
>> Can anybody think of

108
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:34,859
another way to [SOUND] Melissa.

109
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,709
>> Okay.

110
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:42,566
[INAUDIBLE]
square is 100 units.

111
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:51,221
Because 10 times 10 there's.

112
00:05:51,221 --> 00:06:00,811
Okay, that, and then there's [INAUDIBLE]
[SOUND] there's 8 by 8 that aren't shaded,

113
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:08,451
so that's 64, and you subtract 64 from
100.

114
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,727
>> What do you think of that method?

115
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:16,040
[CROSSTALK] Okay, so that would be, so
Melissa though, help me now.

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,365
You've got 10 times 10 first?

117
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:20,686
>> Yeah.

118
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:26,138
>> And then you subtracted 8 times 8.

119
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,834
>> Oh...

120
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,963
Okay and

121
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:38,129
other methods.

122
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,293
Tina.

123
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:46,765
[CROSSTALK] Alright any other methods that
you think you could do it?

124
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,654
Because there was one more in period one.

125
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:50,013
Exactly [COUGH] [CROSSTALK] Zach Morris?

126
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:51,213
Yeah I know Zach.

127
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,887
Alright here's what I'm going to do.

128
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,547
This is the backwards.

129
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,123
Rather than having you guess what
Zachary's method is,

130
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:02,730
which doesn't make any sense at all, I'm
going to show you Zachary's method.

131
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,230
You see if you can see why it makes sense
with the picture, okay?

132
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,255
Here's what Zachary did, and Dana I'll
call on you.

133
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:18,380
[NOISE]
4 times 8 plus 4.

134
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,730
Why does that make

135
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:30,584
sense with the picture?

136
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,729
>> [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK] [CROSSTALK] ,
[INAUDIBLE]. >> Kayla, why does that make

137
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:38,565
sense with the picture.

138
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:43,724
>> Because there, there are 4 sides.

139
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,654
>> You want the what?

140
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:49,750
>> No, [INAUDIBLE] ,um, there are 4 sides.

141
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,442
[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] Okay.

142
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:57,708
There's like four sides, and, there's --
wait.

143
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay.

144
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,330
And there's, there's 8 right here,

145
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,472
8 right here and 8 right here.

146
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,164
Yeah.

147
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:16,578
And that times 4 And it'd be plus 4
becuase 1, 2, 3, 4.

148
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:17,661
Yeah.

149
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,972
>> Anybody want to comment to her?

150
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:27,142
>> [UNKNOWN] [CROSSTALK] Okay, for the one
side if you said

151
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:34,940
that there were eight there so you have
two left over in the.

152
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,645
Corner, and then if you put eight on each
other side there would be one in each of

153
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:43,006
the three corners, or the two corners, two
other corners.

154
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,466
So, we'll basically do like eight times
four, and

155
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,778
then you're going to have laps until you
add one.

156
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,036
Is that same you said?

157
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,256
>> Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

158
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,106
>> I thought you said it very well.

159
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,291
Just show us again with the eights.

160
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,322
>> It's coming from the filling.

161
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:01,897
>> Well, like, these, this, this comes
from eight right here.

162
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:08,455
>> So this whole side length, but what's,
what's the part that you're making out?

163
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:13,699
>> The filled in [INAUDIBLE] All the
corners, okay.

164
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,194
[CROSSTALK] Okay, okay, thank you very
much.

165
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:19,770
All right.

166
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,380
Okay so Kay wanted to come in on Zach's
method.

167
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,480
>> On Zach's method I think it's because
[INAUDIBLE] only that

168
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,840
it's [INAUDIBLE] times 4 and not 9 times
4.

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,850
>> What's the difference?

170
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,620
I really like that fact that Kay is
connecting two methods to each other.

171
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,500
How is Tina and Zach's method alike and
how are they.

172
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,670
>> They different.

173
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,804
Say it again, okay, and then I'll call on
somebody else.

174
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:46,782
>> well, I think it's pretty much the same
[INAUDIBLE] 4 times 8

175
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:51,370
[SOUND] [INAUDIBLE] plus 4, pretty much
the same thing as 9 times 4.

176
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,600
>> Alright, and, and any other comments
about the two methods?

177
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,822
Sarah?
>> Well, the only thing Tina did,

178
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:07,643
was she well because 4 times 8 plus 4, is
the exact same thing as 9 times 4.

179
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:11,923
Only you're saying, instead of having said
9 for

180
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:17,432
the, instead of having the, instead of.

181
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:22,450
I'm distracted, Mindy, by your hand being
up right now.

182
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,562
Please listen to Sarah.

183
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:24,302
>> Okay.

184
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:29,411
Instead of having the 9 4 being multiplied
with

185
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:36,295
the other 8 4's times 4, he added it
after.

186
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:41,150
[INAUDIBLE] So Sarah's thinking about this
numerically.

187
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,603
She's really, she knows that these two are
equal, and, she's saying what, like what,

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,834
what the person did first or second.

189
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,745
>> So an, another way I'd like you to
think about it is

190
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:56,070
what's Zack doing that Tina's not doing.

191
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,970
What's Tina doing that Zack's not doing?

192
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,844
How would those look in the picture?

193
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,164
so, Christa go ahead.

194
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,164
>> Well I think, kind of /g,

195
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:06,416
like it's what I was saying before, he
just took the corners away.

196
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,482
And he took the corners away and added
what was left.

197
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:10,103
And [CROSSTALK].

198
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,307
>> Okay stop for just a second.

199
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:13,690
So Zack took both of the corners off.

200
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,442
>> 1.1 is [UNKNOWN].

201
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:17,920
And Tina just took, she didn't take
anything.

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,124
She just kind of put it there and she kind
of decides minus 1 corner for each side.

203
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,132
>> Now we have Tina here to defend
herself.

204
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,710
Is that right Tina?

205
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,140
>> yeah.
>> Kind of right.

206
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,625
Alright, I'm going to, oh boy.

207
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,409
>> Charmagne.

208
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,036
>> I think my method is also kind like
Tina's and

209
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:40,864
Zachary's because, well, I was counting
the sides and then I subtracted four, but

210
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:46,025
he didn't count the sides and he added
four.

211
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,957
>> okay.
Other comments about how

212
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,372
those methods are alike and different?

213
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:52,305
Let's see.

214
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:54,670
[NOISE] going to ask you to do and turn
that off.

215
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,870
I want you to visualize a square in your
mind, and

216
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,761
use whatever method you want, do I want
you to use whatever method you want?

217
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:05,630
Yeah, I want you to use whatever method
you want, but I want you to

218
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:13,022
shrink the square in your mind, down to a
6 by 6, and then use one of those methods.

219
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:18,730
But instead of there being ten unit
squares on one side, now there are six.

220
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,010
Use one of those methods, and

221
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:28,690
see what you think the total number of
squares, let's keep our hands down.

222
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,690
It's kind of intimidating to have people
that think so fast.

223
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,247
>> Six by six.

224
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:45,327
[SOUND]
'Kay.

225
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:51,145
Now, lets just say that I don't care about
how many there are.

226
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,122
Lets say that what I care about is how
people would do it.

227
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:59,830
>> So, what I want to know is, and not
Charmaine, but someone else.

228
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,758
If the square, if the big square was a six
by six,

229
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:10,470
what would Charmaine have done to get

230
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:20,424
the total number of unit square in the
border?

231
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:20,924
[NOISE]
