1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,527
As you probably know, there's a new
curriculum coming into place for

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:05,108
most states in the United States, and

3
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:09,820
the most important part of that new
curriculum called the Common Call.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,706
In my view, is a section called
Mathematical Practices, and the first

5
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:20,170
standard of the mathematical practices you
will see in their big conceptual is this.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,238
It says mathematical practice one, make
sense of problems and

7
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:26,300
persevere in solving them.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,040
And that practice is being assessed even
in the tests that are being released.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,232
And they're causing students and teachers
to be pretty shocked,

10
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:37,210
because students have to really think
deeply and persevere.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,632
And they're very different from the
previous multiple choice fill in

12
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:45,490
the bubble tests that we used across most
states in the United States.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,511
So students will not develop assistance
unless they're given more open and

14
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:51,120
challenging problems.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,088
And teachers and students can really break
out of that didactic contract and

16
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,062
that's really important.

17
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:01,659
But the students have to develop comfort
with mistakes.

18
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,441
If making a mistake shakes their
confidence they're likely to give up, so

19
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:12,023
in a minute we'll think about way to do
that, ways to help them in those ways.

20
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,766
But we still think about why mistakes are
important.

21
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,730
We thought about learning, we thought
about persistence, and

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,720
the third important reason that I want to
talk about is life.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,910

Peter Sims,

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,180
the New York Times columnist again, and
these are his closing comments on

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,320
his article on how to create entrepreneurs
and design thinkers.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,643
And he said invention and

27
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:39,439
discovery emanate from the ability to try
seemingly wild possibilities.

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,211
To feel comfortable being wrong before
being right,

29
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:46,117
to live in the world as a careful
observer, open to different experiences,

30
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:49,645
to play with ideas without prematurely
judging oneself or others,

31
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:53,740
to persist through difficulties and have a
willingness to be misunderstood,

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,130
sometimes for long periods despite the
conventional wisdom.
