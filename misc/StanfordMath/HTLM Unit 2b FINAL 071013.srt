1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,207
So the research conducted by Carol Dweck
and

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:06,510
her colleagues on student mindset has been
really interesting and important.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,352
And there's going to be an interview with
Carol later, especially for

4
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:11,280
math teachers and parents.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,305
But first let's look at some of

6
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:15,700
the recent things that have been learned
about the brain.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,323
And the key finding that everyone is
talking about,

8
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,505
is what is referred to as brain
plasticity.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,843
So, people used to think that some people
had the brain for math or other subjects

10
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:31,550
and some didn't, but recently there have
been stunning examples of brain growth.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,114
Now, the brain isn't actually made of
plastic, but the idea of neuroplasticity

12
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:39,878
refers to the life long capacity of the
brain to change and rewire itself.

13
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,070
In fact there have been stunning examples
of the brain's ability to

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,680
create new neurons and connections in
recent years.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,010
So when learning happens, the synapse
fires.

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,838
Electric currents fire and create new
neurons and connections between neurons,

17
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:01,300
and the paths of a synapse are like
footprints in the sand.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,073
They can become firm paths if they're
traveled a lot, but

19
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,380
without use, they wash away.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,770
And the brain is so flexible, its changing
by the minute.

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,800
It's losing and gaining connections.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,249
You may even be gaining or

23
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:18,985
losing, hopefully, the former synaptic
connections right now.

24
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:24,620
So, let me introduce you now to the life
of a London cab driver.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,022
All London drivers have to learn 320
routes that help them remember and

26
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,004
learn the 25,000 streets and 20,000
landmarks and

27
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:38,955
places of interest within a six mile
radius of Charing Crossing in London.

28
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,359
So it's extremely complex, and

29
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,640
they have to pass a test which is called
The Knowledge.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,200
All Black Cab drivers have to have passed
The Knowledge.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,510
It takes between two and four years to
pass the All London Knowledge.

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,130
And once you're licensed, you can work
anywhere in the greater London area.

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,400
Here's a photo of London's streets.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,023
As you can see, there's no grid structure
in London.

35
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:05,293
So what the researchers found is that the
taxi drivers go through a training period,

36
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:11,140
and by the end of their training period,
the hippocampus had grown.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,640
When they retire from being a black cab
driver later in life,

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,260
the hippocampus shrinks back down again.

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,140
They also found that compared to the
brains of London taxi

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,000
drivers with London bus drivers, and

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,720
the London bus drivers don't have to learn
such a complex set of routes, and

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,240
found the hippocampus of the taxi drivers
was bigger than the bus drivers.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,863
So the region of the hippocampus that had
grown is the, is specialized in acquiring

44
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:41,750
and using complex spatial information in
order to navigate efficiently.

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,830
So a second example of brain growth was a
nine year old girl who had half of

46
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,970
her brain move, removed.

47
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,100
She was having fits and they literally
took out one hemisphere.

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,556
And at first her left side, her whole left
side was paralyzed, but

49
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,640
she amazed doctors.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,936
As within weeks she'd grown connections
back and

51
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:04,290
eventually in a very short time developed
all of her functions back.

52
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,648
And that was because of the incredible and
fast growth of her brain.

53
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:11,330
And then the third example, that was
interesting.

54
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,984
Researchers at the National Institute of
Mental Health found that after a 3

55
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:17,536
week intervention, 3 weeks of working
differently,

56
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:22,720
participants in the experiment changed the
structure of their brains.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,320
So, we now know that all students, maybe
except, you know, those with a very

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,060
specific learning disability, but all
other students can achieve at the highest

59
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:38,070
levels in maths, in all levels of school,
okay, right up to the end of high school.

60
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,165
And other countries that believe this
about students do a lot better than we do

61
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:46,200
in the US or the UK, so countries such as
Japan.

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,020
So here's the irony, children can develop
half a brain or

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,000
change their brain significantly yet,

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,060
we think kids can't develop a few neurons
they need to learn algebra.

65
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,659
Many people think that some kids are
capable or smart or high ability or

66
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,110
what you want to call it and some are not.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,176
Now we all know that students come into
math classes with some of them

68
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:10,672
finding work easier, some finding it
really challenging, but

69
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:14,330
that doesn't reflect their potential for
future work.

70
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,082
What it tells you is that students have
been having different experiences since

71
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:21,722
childhood and some of those experience
have been causing synapses to fire and

72
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,980
some haven't.

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,697
So as teachers our job is really to
disrupt the trajectories of students who

74
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:31,414
haven't had challenging experiences, and
it's to provide all students for

75
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:36,100
the richest and most challenging
environment possible.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,732
If our brain can change in three weeks,

77
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:42,850
think what students can do over the course
of a year with the right materials.

78
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,320
So to recap, brain research tells us a
number of things.

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,904
It tells us every child can excel in
mathematics in school from elementary to

80
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,080
high school.

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,531
It tells us about the potential of the
brain to grow,

82
00:04:55,531 --> 00:05:00,770
no matter where students start from, and
that potential is huge.

83
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,790
It tells us that every new learning
experience is, changes your ability.

84
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,156
Even though we think of students of having
a certain ability or not being high or

85
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:11,990
low, every experience can change that
ability.

86
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,518
So we use fixed ability language all the
time, high and low kids, and

87
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:17,940
we need to rethink that.

88
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,759
So scientists know that kids can develop
the wiring to learn any maths in school,

89
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,240
but many teacher and parents still believe
in a kind of natural ability.

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
And a number of schools, probably most
schools,

91
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,690
are still set up on outdated models of
fixed ability thinking.

92
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,602
So if you wanted to take on this new
evidence on brain growth and

93
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,750
ability, how would it change what you do?

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,690
In your classroom, if you're a teacher, or

95
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,554
in your interactions as a parent, or
another helper, or

96
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:55,499
in your school if you're an administrator,
or leader who's planning schools.
