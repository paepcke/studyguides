1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,004
So, we're going to listen now to three of
the boys in Nick's class that I

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,590
caught up with after the number talk.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,696
So, the first question they, that I asked
them,

4
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:11,418
that you'll see them respond to is what
they think of math?

5
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:14,388
So, if you can get past their cuteness, I
want you to think about and

6
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:16,332
discuss afterwards, what surprised you or

7
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,970
interested, interested you in what they
said?

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,675
So, do you guys like math?

9
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:22,685
>> Yes.
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:23,700
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,921
So, you like doing them?

12
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,990
How about you, Dylan?

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,330
>> Well, it's, like, it's free.

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,618
It's like, you can do whatever you want.

15
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:30,452
>> huh, you like that?

16
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:31,540
>> Yeah.
It's, like, it's, like,

17
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,077
multiplication, division, you can, like,
break it down to different,

18
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,406
different parts, and then do the
multiplication and division.

19
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:37,987
>> Uh-huh.
So,

20
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,579
how many of you thought this about math,
that it's free and

21
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,962
you can do what you want?

22
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:46,009
>> Probably just now and today.

23
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,825
>> Not like since we're, like, since
second grade.

24
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:50,517
>> Mm-hmm.
So, it's second grade?

25
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,190
Because sometimes math isn't taught like
that, people don't think that about math.

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,355
What has helped you think like that?

27
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,976
>> [NOISE] Well, actually, like all the
ideas help you can do it.

28
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:04,468
>> Probably the way that Nick taught us to
do it.

29
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:07,037
>> Yeah, it's like, it's like there's
different ways.

30
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,194
>> Uh-huh.
[CROSSTALK], so

31
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,900
it's like, it's like really cool.

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,915
>> It is really cool then.

33
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:15,230
That's really important thing about math.

34
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,660
You can solve math problems in different
ways, but most people don't think that.

35
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,530
They think there's just one way to do it.

36
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,260
>> Yeah.
>> So it's an important thing.

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,281
>> There's like three or four ways to do
it, but nobody even thinks about it.

38
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,737
>> Mm-hm.
What about you?

39
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:30,541
What's your favorite math thing to do?

40
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,106
>> I like decomposing and adding.

41
00:01:34,106 --> 00:01:35,498
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:36,884
Mm-hm.

43
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:40,169
What is, what's a friendly number?

44
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:42,012
>> It's like ten and five.

45
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,022
>> Friendly numbers is like when you add
five, like for

46
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,998
example five times five plus four plus
seven.

47
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,013
>> Uh-huh.

48
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,861
>> Ten is a really friendly number so.

49
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,610
>> Uh-huh.

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,301
>> What do you think about the talking
about math part?

51
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:00,126
Do you think that helps you understand or?

52
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:03,342
>> It does.

53
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:06,346
>> It does and doesn't.

54
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,020
>> Uh-huh.

55
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,664
Tell me about why it does first.

56
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:13,458
Or you tell me, anyone.

57
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:17,940
>> It actually does, because you can see
what other people did compared to yours.

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,318
>> Mm-hm.
>> You see how other people will do it.

59
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,674
>> Well, you can see what other people
think, and

60
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,730
then you can like tell what you think.

61
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,429
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

62
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,622
also sometimes we make mistakes, everybody
makes mistakes.

63
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:36,870
>> [CROSSTALK], actually, you made a
mistake too, if you made one.

64
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,440
>> Uh-huh, and mistakes are great because
you can learn from mistakes.

65
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,008
We all make mistakes.

66
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:46,749
Do you feel okay if you're doing kind of
math talk and you make a mistake?

67
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,399
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

68
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,259
>> Yeah, pretty much.

69
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,811
>> Cause it's like they, and just like
help us out and tell us like, and

70
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,791
help us with the answers.

71
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,923
>> Mm-hm, that's right.

72
00:02:54,923 --> 00:03:00,314
>> They tell us when to do it so we don't
have to more math work.

73
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:00,842
>> [LAUGH], so,

74
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,626
do you think math is a subject where
you're always following rules, or

75
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,930
is it a subject where you get to think
about ideas?

76
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,740
Which do you think it is?

77
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,370
>> I think it's like,

78
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,974
where you can think about different things
at one time to make one thing work.

79
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,294
>> It's like you're free.

80
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,812
You can do whatever you want.

81
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:16,792
It's like breaking down, decompose.

82
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,574
>> You can do what you want to get an
answer.

83
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,224
>> You can make friendly numbers.

84
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,732
You can like breaking down to
multiplication.

85
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:23,360
>> Uh-huh.

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,108
So, those math talks let you do all those
things, didn't they.

87
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,398
>> Yeah.
>> Did you use math in

88
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:31,438
those ways before this class?

89
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:33,866
Did you break it down and do all those
different things?

90
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:34,369
>> No.
>> No.

91
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:34,898
>> Not at all.

92
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,634
>> So what did you, what did you,

93
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:42,733
how is it different?
>> Well, it's like Nick teachers us

94
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:46,453
like kind of, how to break it down, like,
use multiplication problems, so

95
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,800
it's like easier.

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,392
>> Mm-hm.
>> To make friendly numbers,

97
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,501
like decomposing and all that stuff.

98
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:53,165
>> Mm-hm.
So,

99
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,125
does that help you solve math problems,
being able to break down the numbers and

100
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,463
make friendly numbers?

101
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:00,904
>> A lot.
>> Also it's different to at

102
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,100
the same time because you don't normally
do

103
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,628
that until third grade so.

104
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,291
>> Mm-hm.
So,

105
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,280
do you think now you've learned to do
that, you can do that in

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,294
other math problems that you get?

107
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,184
>> Yeah.
>> Even when you're not in

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,672
the math course?
>> Yeah, if Nick didn't teach us this,

109
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,125
we would be like.

110
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,995
What is in like fourth grade?
>> Uh-huh.

111
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:26,317
>> We'd be really bad at fourth grade,

112
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:35,691
and really in other years of class.
