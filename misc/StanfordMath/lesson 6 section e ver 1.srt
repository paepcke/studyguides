1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,298
So in this first part of the class, we've
explored what it means to think and

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:06,170
problem-solve conceptually.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,730
For the second part, I want to work on
something just as important.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,890
And that is, I want to think about what it
means to

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,410
build an inquiry relationship with maths.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,334
[MUSIC]
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:23,964
So I'd like now to show you some
interviews with five people who use

8
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:29,410
mathematics, including some very high
level math users.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,216
And in my view, they are suing something
really important that I want us to

10
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:35,030
think hard about and focus on in this
session.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,590
So, I'm going to ask you to listen to five
people.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,890
Each person is a little over four minutes
long, so that's 20 minutes of your time.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,804
Please give them your full attention,
maybe take a break between each one,

14
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,732
they're really interesting.

15
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:52,890
And after each one you're going to be
prompted to write down the main ideas that

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,010
they're saying, just in a few different
words.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,140
You can make it into a concept map or you
can just list it.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,051
>> But what were the big ideas that they
Gave your,

19
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:06,145
what were the big ideas they talked about,
and the smaller ideas too?

20
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:10,369
>> Given how you use math in your work and
how lots of us use math, if you were to

21
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,725
help teachers design courses that would be
really useful for people going into

22
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:21,455
the workplace, what, what do you think
would be important to them?

23
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,255
>> Be the emphasis?

24
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:27,303
>> I mean I believe that kids need to
master the basics, but

25
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:30,647
after that, I think, for me, project based
or,

26
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:39,003
practical examples are the best way to
learn, and reinforce material.

27
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:43,212
Because that again, that's how I learn the
math that I use, is by seeing patients and

28
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:46,440
going through
>> Real life examples.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,058
For me, that's what I remember better than
if I'm sitting down and

30
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:55,840
trying to memorize something from, from a
page that I'm reading.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,375
So I would be trying to incorporate that
more.

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:03,154
>> Did you hear that much in your math
teaching?

33
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:08,600
>> I mean it was It, you know, it was
abysmal.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,330
[LAUGH] Where I went to school.

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,347
There was nothing progressive about it and

36
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:19,522
it was very traditional [UNKNOWN] and
dull.

37
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,635
>> You didn't enjoy it?

38
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:24,000
>> Calculus was the first time I enjoyed
math.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,575
>> Interesting.

40
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,528
>> Well calculus is more conceptual.

41
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,621
>> Mhm.

42
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:34,020
It was the first time I didn't feel
terrible about my mathematical abilities.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,840
I always felt like I was bad at math.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,808
>> When I was thinking about answering
questions about how I use math,

45
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:42,935
at first I was having trouble thinking of
examples outside of work, but

46
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:46,115
When I probed deeper, I, I realized the
reason I was having trouble using

47
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:52,138
examples is because I'm using it, but not,
I don't consider it math.

48
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,052
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And it's so interesting to me so

49
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:59,008
an example is a couple of days ago I
ordered a desk for for the study.

50
00:02:59,008 --> 00:02:59,554
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And

51
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,036
I realized you know I was measuring the
space,

52
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,672
you know the height
>> Uh-huh.

53
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,952
>> and length and width and then I went
online and

54
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:10,605
I want-, I had to see which of the desk
would fit or even loading the dishwasher.

55
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,680
You're using geometry.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,380
Once it clicked, I realized I use it
everywhere.

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,900
I was explaining this to my daughter
during dinner and

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,709
I think she really understood finally.

59
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,258
I said we're using math all the time
without realizing it.

60
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,230
It becomes intuitive.

61
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,110
We don't consider it math.

62
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,110
I think the reason we don't consider it
math is we view math as

63
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,500
something that's either hard or very
formal or structured.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,450
So it's just a problem in our perception.

65
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,270
If it's not hard or formal or structured,
we're not saying it's math, but

66
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,985
the truth is we're using it all the time.

67
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:51,823
Even estimating you know like make having
my kids share things,

68
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:58,560
dividing up portions all the time and
seeing you know is this equal.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,434
All kinds of ways you know even things
like driving.

70
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,072
>> Yeah exactly.

71
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:02,657
>> I think we all do

72
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,624
this we're estimating how long
>> Yeah.

73
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,872
>> Is it going to take us to get to the
school and I need to leave at this time.

74
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,960
>> Right.
>> Oh but I have to stop and

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,232
pick this kid up so.

76
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:11,757
My whole car pool schedule and

77
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:14,929
all the things I do outside of my job that
are just with my kids or

78
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:19,790
household, there's so much Matthew don't
even realize it.

79
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,122
>> I'm a software engineer at Udacity.

80
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,805
Udacity's a education start-up.

81
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,862
>> For online kind of learning platform.

82
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:27,552
>> Uh-huh, and

83
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:33,150
how about you just start by describing
what you're doing in your current job.

84
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,250
>> Sure.
So, I'm a software engineer.

85
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,890
I work with a team of people I, I mainly
focus at the moment on analytics.

86
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,850
So, we're analyzing the performance of our
course content and also the performance of

87
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,270
the students, and its a problem that has
never been solved before.

88
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,362
That's why I work, pretty, day to day on
something that I don't know how to solve,

89
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:58,268
and it's coming up with different ideas
and eating things and we have a lot to

90
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:02,794
learn about things like data science and a
lot to learn about handling huge data sets

91
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:09,550
so a lot of innovation that we're trying
to work through.

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,470
Actually I don't really know how it
happened and

93
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,590
I think it was kind of an anomaly, but I
managed to spend my seventh, eighth,

94
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,422
ninth and tenth grades of middle school
and first half of high school in

95
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,534
a math program called the Interactive Math
Program,

96
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:25,225
which was developed by a guy here I think
in the Bay area.

97
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,503
>> That and it was inquiry based math
which I didn't know anything about at

98
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,340
the time.

99
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,662
We talked back then a lot about deep
learning and

100
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:37,190
shallow learning, and it was pretty
controversial.

101
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,318
And a lot of you know parents,

102
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,960
yanked their kids out of the program
because it was so weird.

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,210
I loved it, and it was just based on
problems.

104
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,344
You know, problems of the day and

105
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,000
problems of the week that all, you know,
culminated into a problem of the unit.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,456
And they presented, you know, these
problems, you know, like that we have to,

107
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:56,074
you know, try and solve and we had no idea
how to solve them and two months later all

108
00:05:56,074 --> 00:06:01,731
of a sudden out of nowhere we had all the
tool we needed to solve them.

109
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:06,278
And that turns out to be exactly what I do
from day to day.

110
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,464
>> Mm-hm.
>> I would choose learning the skills and

111
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:13,650
having the courage to just sit down and
figure out how to solve something.

112
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,273
And then, after that, learning the
vernacular, that is incorporated you know,

113
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,487
into that you know.

114
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:24,295
That as, I was pretty lucky I think to
have that guidance early on and

115
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:27,287
that certainly set you know built a
framework for

116
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:32,136
which I pretty much accomplish things in
life.

117
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:32,834
>> Mm-hm.

118
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:37,074
>> Oh, a mechanical way I guess of going
about it just never sinks in.

119
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:41,480
And you know which because I never honed
in that aspect of my mind.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,031
You know at least in terms of math of just
remembering, you know,

121
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,649
these steps on how to, I can always get
back to where I need to go but

122
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:52,736
sometimes I have to spend a little bit of
time building that, and I wonder,

123
00:06:52,736 --> 00:07:01,495
I mean so the people I guess in my life
around me that have more traditional math.

124
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,620
They also don't remember the mechanics
unless they're familiar.

125
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,396
The difference is that they don't often
have the courage to sit there or

126
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:14,236
the self confidence of given enough time
and enough resources and maybe

127
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:20,995
a couple other people to help me, I'm
going to be able to solve this problem.

128
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,630
>> You know.

129
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,788
And, and it's, there's that sense of self
confidence and you know, you know,

130
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:31,740
there's, you know, the talk about you
know, fixed versus growth mindsets.

131
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,930
And, and sometimes you know, there's a
certain amount of courage I

132
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,240
think it takes to have a growth mindset,
you know, and it's just self confidence.

133
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,228
>> Mm-hm.
>> And so, and

134
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:45,388
it doesn't seem like, the traditional math
to me, seems like it

135
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:53,970
really doesn't offer students the ability
to develop their own sense of courage.

136
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,806
And so if they're lucky enough to have it
and

137
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:59,300
maintain it through that math experience,
awesome, great.

138
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,793
>> Mm-hm.
>> But there's a chance that if even if

139
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:03,880
they started to maintain it or if they
didn't come into math with it already,

140
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,575
there's a really good chance that they'll
either lose it or never,

141
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:12,570
never gain that aspect of, which then to
me that's really critical part of life.

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,262
>> Because I saw that for myself was
really that really what made,

143
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:22,790
made a big difference both when I was
younger And when I was out of school.

144
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,817
What, what could be the answer to that?

145
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,030
>> Yeah.
>> How could that be?

146
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,594
Why?
And the more that we ask those questions I

147
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:34,872
think and let children answer them, the
more interested they'll be in

148
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:40,059
that topic and I, I think That for me that
made a big difference that s,

149
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:49,030
there were people who were willing to help
me figure out why.

150
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,538
And that takes a long time.

151
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,299
>> Right.
>> So to, to figure out why there are two

152
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,744
different kinds of clouds in the sky
>> Mm-hm.

153
00:08:57,744 --> 00:09:02,154
>> To figure out you know, I don't know,
why one duck is floating faster down

154
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:06,564
the river than the other one and to do a
little experiment with it takes time,

155
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:12,102
which not a lot of us have, myself
included.

156
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:15,398
And to not be willing to answer it with,

157
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:23,290
good question, let's figure it out
sometime or let's do that later.

158
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,800
To be willing to catch yourself is tough
and

159
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,750
>> Especially for an educator or

160
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,636
who has a classroom of kids, but if you
have a,

161
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:35,068
I see some of my, my daughter, my
daughter's friends,

162
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:43,545
there might be very few circumstances
under which some of the kids will ask why.

163
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:44,158
>> Yeah.

164
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:45,868
>> And if you have a kid that asks why all
the time I

165
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:49,622
think you have a lot of chances, but if
you have a kid who doesn't...

166
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,120
>> The time that he does say.

167
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,056
Why is that?

168
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:53,884
>> Yeah.

169
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,910
>> Great!

170
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,660
[LAUGH] Let's answer that for you.

171
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,948
And you see it in the work place,

172
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:04,160
you see those people who have a creative
curiosity.

173
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,330
And, and I, and I have to believe that
it's been cultivated for them.

174
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,181
>> Yeah.
>> Some of us are more curious by nature,

175
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:15,308
sure but a, a lot of people have either
let themselves answer questions

176
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,359
for themselves.

177
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:17,884
>> Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

178
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,480
>> Or they've had people when they were
little help them answer.

179
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,956
>> Yeah.
>> And that, that curiosity is what,

180
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,792
what makes the difference, I'm an
engineer, makes the difference between

181
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:35,590
someone who's a perfectly fine engineer,
and someone who's is a great engineer.

182
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,530
I wonder how that works.

183
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,350
Could I make that better?

184
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,090
Why did that work that way?

185
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,190
And oh that's strange, I haven't seen that
before.

186
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,998
There are people who just don't ask those
questions, and the more we

187
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:52,865
can encourage it, they're going to be
better at their jobs later I'm sure.

188
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:53,990
>> Yeah, wouldn't it be great for

189
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,930
all sorts of people with a thousand
questions over time.

190
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,760
You know, so math was sort of a slog.

191
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,780
There was nothing fun about it.

192
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,100
There was nothing like, yay math.

193
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,000
This is something I can, you know, whereas
I was reading books,

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,425
gobbling them up as much as possible, so
it was part of my school life and

195
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:14,650
my pleasure life But by the time, and I
actually,

196
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:23,760
I started the calculus when we started to
doing past, like, the algebra, calculus.

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,522
And I was like oh, this is actually
kind of fun like, I like the, kind of,

198
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:30,954
conceptual, conceptualizing of, of math
ideas, not numbers,

199
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:37,148
because the numbers were like, can you do
the times tables in your head?

200
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:39,064
No.
But then we did geometry and

201
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:43,750
you think geometry that's of course that's
easy right that's squares and circles and

202
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,340
you know spheres.

203
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,596
But that, that was so hard for me and I
think I,

204
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm such a practical person I'm sort of a
problem solver so.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,430
Here I was where I understand the circle
but's a perfect thing.

206
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,192
Circles are perfect suddenly the it took
it to this meta level and

207
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:08,841
I couldn't, I couldn't put it in the real
world at all.

208
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:13,228
It was just
>> So how does that make you feel?

209
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,850
>> Well you feel terrible, right?

210
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,213
You feel sort of hopeless an and

211
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:19,730
especially when some people are getting it
and some people aren't.

212
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,195
So there's no There's no barometer to say
you know,

213
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:26,850
oh well that means I'm not so smart.

214
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,970
Cause I don't understand geometry.

215
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,771
Because that other person seems to be
doing fine.

216
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:36,235
And I think, I think that, that sort of
breaking up of what you're good at and

217
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:42,515
not good at suddenly makes the world into
sort of sequestered parts.

218
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:46,187
And I think that plays with your
self-esteem and you know, you

219
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:53,080
walk down the street and you don't say,
well I'm not good at walking so I'll skip.

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,860
You know, the world is holistic.

221
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,262
Everything you do is connected, so when
there's one thing you don't do well,

222
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:05,990
it makes you question whether, you know
you will do well with everything.

223
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,370
Well you know what I think is really
interesting in your class,

224
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,530
when the math students, they approached,
they were approaching math like we

225
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,690
approach humanities, not as a right or
wrong answer, not as a there, you know,

226
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,200
if you don't, if you don't follow these
steps you won't get to the,

227
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,806
you know, pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow.

228
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,262
But that it, it's adaptable and changeable
and fluid, and

229
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:37,296
that, that your emotions can get involved,
and you can, you can feel it.

230
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,932
>> Mm-hm.

231
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,164
>> And I think, you know that,

232
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,860
I think there's something that we're
taught about numbers, that they're cold,

233
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,280
you know they're, they're, it's either
right or it's wrong.

234
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,540
You either get it or you don't.

235
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,576
And I think that, the difference of
feeling you know,

236
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:58,100
we have, we all have an intuitive sense of
numbers too.

237
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,446
I mean we all have an intuitive sense of
what time it is or

238
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:03,608
how long something takes or you know and,
and you can, you can develop those

239
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:09,110
muscles to be really good, but to the
minute or you know to the number.

240
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,290
Or you can let that be very loose and
dizzy, and time will just disappear.

241
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,004
So I, I really thought I appreciated the
you know in,

242
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:21,164
sort, we talk about the sort of sciences
and the hard sciences and the soft.

243
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:25,294
>> You know, the soft subjects and soft
subjects, they're always given in

244
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:30,124
such a bad rap for being, you know Touchy
feely and not being about accuracy or or

245
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:37,507
true knowledge
>> Mm-hm.

246
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,594
>> And seeing, seeing your class made me
think of you know,

247
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,295
numbers don't have to be hard and

248
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:48,790
impenetrable, they're a part of they're,
they're an organic part of our lives.

249
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,890
>> So if you can have that sort of To have
feelings about math and

250
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,665
you could actually enjoy it.

251
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:58,202
>> Yeah, but
>> Most of my,

252
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,257
my math is extremely intuitive.

253
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:04,473
I remember writing a paper actually
[UNKNOWN] from Coursera on

254
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:08,627
a robotic formula which was very
complicated.

255
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:09,278
>> Mm-hmm.

256
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:09,870
>> And I intuitively.

257
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,190
Guess the formula correctly, and implement
it, and they work beautifully.

258
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,290
And I spend the next four or five weeks
trying to derive it mathematically because

259
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,390
I knew it was intuitively correct, but I
couldn't understand why.

260
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,930
Eventually I got the math together.

261
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,874
I had to make certain assumptions that
weren't implicit in the derivation to

262
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,640
make the formula correct.

263
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,730
I always felt math is just about the most
intuitive thing on the planet.

264
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,348
Is just explained very poorly, like we all
know, I don't know, how long an hour is,

265
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:39,750
how long two hours are, we don't know if
you run into something that takes two

266
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,740
hours and we wake for 16 hours a day and
how many of those things we can do.

267
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,332
And at that level of math math is, I
think, really easy, and

268
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:51,950
almost everything, from really complex
measure theory to integration, to like

269
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,770
the most abstract approximation theory and
asymptote I think are similar in nature.

270
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,600
They are very intuitive.

271
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,075
These little observations are the key
observations, I think, and

272
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,640
everybody is proficient in those.

273
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,450
Everybody knows how to play Sudoku.

274
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,230
The sad part is when, when the abstraction
comes along putting these into formulas,

275
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,540
people often lose intuition.

276
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,592
They think but these are like abstract
little things they have to

277
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,050
manipulate according to fixed rules.

278
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,734
And those fixed rule manipulations are
devoid of an,

279
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,248
of an intuitive interpretation.

280
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,060
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And that's when we should say, stop.

281
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,970
We should just not do it.

282
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,963
We should refuse to do it.

283
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:28,766
>> Mm-hmm.
>> We should just say,

284
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:31,345
okay I only am willing to manipulate
equations I understand.

285
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,970
I understand intuitively and if it takes
us longer that's fine.

286
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,058
I remember in my early scientific career
I,

287
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:40,306
I stared at papers that, from today's
perspective, look measly and

288
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:45,278
I would spend two weeks on one math
formula to internalizde it.

289
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,270
And after two weeks I would get it,
eventually, and understand it.

290
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,080
And then these two weeks made this piece
of complicated math really intuitive.

291
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,875
I've never been able to make any progress
in math without really understanding and

292
00:16:55,875 --> 00:17:00,350
having an emotional relationship to what's
happening.

293
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,884
Now you've watched all five of the
interviews, I'd like you to choose one of

294
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:07,019
them and write about a really cool either
a lesson idea perhaps, or

295
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,382
a discussion topic if you're a parent,
that the math person's words and

296
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:14,430
ideas make you think about.

297
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,780
One of them at least, I'm sure inspired
you to do something really interesting in

298
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,636
a class or in a conversation And I want to
give you space to write about that now.

299
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:25,950
So, write a paragraph, perhaps about that.

300
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:31,352
Its going to be sent to three other people
and

301
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:38,374
you'll get other people to comment on.
