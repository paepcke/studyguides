[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,178
So welcome to Session Three.

3
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:11,517
And this session is really around one idea
but it's such a big and

4
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:16,680
important one for math, that I thought it
deserved a whole session.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,520
But first a question for you.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,478
I'd like you to think back to some time
when you were learning maths and

7
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:24,539
you made a mistake and you got things
wrong.

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,905
It may be recent or it may be a long time
ago.

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:31,120
But I, what I want to you think about is,
how did that make you feel.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,480
And please be as honest as you can in
submitting this quiz.
