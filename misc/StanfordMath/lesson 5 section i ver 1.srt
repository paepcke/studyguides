1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,880
So I'm going to finish this session with
some thoughts.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,450
Math is a creative subject that can be
seen in different ways,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,900
it can be solved in different ways.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,119
People think of humanities subjects as the
ones that are more open.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,740
And can be solved in different ways.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,735
But math has something really important
and unique really in its contribution.

7
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:26,200
Often in math there is one answer, not
always, but sometimes there's one answer.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,680
But always people can see methods and
solutions in different ways.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,928
And what we find is when we have students
work together in groups and

10
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:38,046
they're coming together to find an answer,
but they are sharing their different ways

11
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:44,530
of thinking, that gives them a really
important opportunity to work together.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,092
And some think it's different in
humanities, they may be more different,

13
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:48,478
and coming up with different ideas, but

14
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:51,440
they're actually working to the same
conclusion.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,200
But they're doing that by thinking and

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,900
getting contributions from different
students with different types of thinking.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,869
And in my set, what I've found is that
process of getting different ideas and

18
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,444
different perspectives, and

19
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:08,413
finding one solution led to a particular
form of equity in classrooms that I

20
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:15,985
called relational equity, that was about
how students viewed each other's thoughts.

21
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:19,640
And those are, keep that in the references
if you want to read more about that.

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,056
So math is a subject that can and

23
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,555
should be represented visually at every
opportunity, and

24
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm going to show you some more visual
representations in the next session.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,363
It's a subject that's all about different
connections between ideas and

26
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:38,773
its those connections that mathematicians
and others regard as beautiful.

27
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,545
And if we want students to understand math
deeply and

28
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:45,451
to appreciate that beauty in maths and to
develop a strong foundation,

29
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,798
from which your mathematical thinking can
build, then we really need to encourage

30
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:57,292
a connected approach to the subject, and
it should all start with Number Sense.

31
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:59,722
So, I'm going to, introduce you to some
more ideas and

32
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:03,010
ways of thinking about this in the next
session.
