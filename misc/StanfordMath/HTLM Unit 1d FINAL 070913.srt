1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:02,728
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:04,771
So now we're going to learn about
stereotype threat.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,842
My dean Claude Steele, he's dean of the
Stanford Graduate School of Education,

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,697
is a world-renowned psychologist.

5
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:12,995
And he conceptualized and

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:17,880
started a whole field of work on what's
called stereotype threat.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,513
And over decades Claude and

8
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:24,674
his colleagues have found that many people
suffer from stereotypes.

9
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:28,804
Women in maths, African-American in
academic, students in academic settings,

10
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:32,040
white students around sporting ability.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,362
So they have many studies on stereotype
threat, and

12
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:37,872
they have many studies on girls and maths,
showing that if women take a test and

13
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:42,880
beforehand just mark off their gender in a
box, they underperform.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,240
If they don't mark off their gender
there's no underperformance.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,912
A group of psychologists at Princeton
conducted an experiment with white and

16
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:54,770
African-American students who were given a
golfing task.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,308
When the white students were given the
task and they were told that it,

18
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,053
the golfing task measured natural athletic
ability,

19
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:07,040
they golfed a lot worse than the white
students who were not told anything.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,938
When the same messages were given to black
students, it didn't affect their

21
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:14,030
performance, as poor athletic ability
isn't a stereotype they suffer from.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,638
In the early studies,

23
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:21,380
they reminded people of gender differences
by getting them to mark gender on a form.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,976
Later they found they didn't even need to
do that because stereotypes are,

25
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:27,820
as they say, always in the air.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,596
Which is why they call it stereotype
threat,

27
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:32,222
there's always the threat of that
stereotype.

28
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:33,902
And researchers have found the gender and

29
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:38,620
math stereotype to be established in girls
as young as five years old.

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,160
So they talk about the fact that young
girls are put off from engaging in

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,340
math before they even have a chance to
engage in maths because of

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,570
the stereotypes the air.

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,600
So Claude concludes in his book, the
stereotype threat affects all of us in

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,198
subtle and not so subtle ways, but they're
all damaging.

35
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:01,240
And I really recommend reading the entire
book.

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,943
This student that I'm going to play for
you now really showed for

37
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,525
me that, that subtle, in the air effect of
a stereotype.

38
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:12,064
>> I would say that I've felt
discrimination from classmates as

39
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,925
a female.

40
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:19,173
I think that not, not so much in high
school but here, I feel it.

41
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:24,763
It's like not directly, but subtle things,
like oh, like, they won't ask me for

42
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:32,610
my help, or they just will, like, kind of
bulldoze over what I'm saying.

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,945
So not anything direct, but subtle things.

44
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,805
>> I'm constantly amazed by how many
students are given

45
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:44,440
gender messages whether subtle or not so
subtle, math isn't for you.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,275
And here's another one of my students
talking about that.

47
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:51,899
>> In fourth grade, I remember being so
curious about why a square was a rectangle

48
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:58,620
but a rectangle wasn't a square and really
caring about those sorts of problems.

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,372
And then, as soon as people start telling
you math isn't your thing,

50
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:04,925
then it's all downhill.

51
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,877
>> So as students come to maths classrooms
and to any

52
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:14,450
math work with some serious stereotypes in
the air about gender and about race.

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,363
And these combined with general views that
only some kids can be good at maths.

54
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:21,805
And that maths is about a natural ability
that only some people have.

55
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:24,484
And we're going to look closely at that
one idea of natural ability in

56
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,010
the next sessions.

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,684
So we're beginning to see part of the
reason that mathematics education is in

58
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:33,090
a poor state.

59
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,217
Some messages can send students off the
rails even if they aren't about

60
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,536
gender or race.

61
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:41,968
People have told me recalling really in
very sharp detail how once in seventh or

62
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,788
eighth grade, they asked the question and

63
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,605
the teachers said to them, that's a baby
question.

64
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,410
And how they decided at that point that
maths was not a subject for them.

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,748
So, the first session in the student
version of this class will be

66
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,710
about countering these stereotypes.

67
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,730
and, and [UNKNOWN] students, negating
those messages that they may have heard,

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,276
and really helping them believe and know
that they can be really good at maths.

69
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:12,180
So a quick shortish question now for you.

70
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,362
What do you think you can do, as a teacher
or as a parent or whatever

71
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:28,602
role you have, to counter these damaging
stereotypes?
