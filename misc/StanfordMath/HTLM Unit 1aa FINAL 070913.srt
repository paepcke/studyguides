00:00:00,928 --> 00:00:05,572
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,196
Welcome to the first course of How to
Learn Maths.

3
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:11,598
This course is for teachers, parents,
administrators, anyone who teach or

4
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,580
helps people learn maths.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,556
But a similar class is going to be
released for

6
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:20,380
students in this school year, probably in
the fall or just after the winter break.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,120
The version you will take is nowhere near
as, polished or zappy.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,368
The student version is going to have some
different cool animations and

9
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:31,500
graphics and, different ways to engage the
students.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,640
Different questions and interviews and so
on, but the ideas are going to be similar.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,630
But I wanted to introduce you first to
those ideas.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,600
So who am I?

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
At this point we have 20,000 people
enrolled in the course.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,245
And I know some of you know me well, some
of you have read my book or

15
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:51,370
recent books or research work.

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,090
And many probably most of you have no idea
who I am.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,227
So, I am a professor of mathematics
education at Stafford University.

18
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:03,727
But before being a professor and during
that time taught mathematics or

19
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:11,278
maths as we say in the UK you will hear me
say both math and maths in this course.

20
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:13,590
And I have taught maths at many different
levels.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,486
So, in, in a city in London I taught the
age range of ages eleven to eighteen as we

22
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:21,001
do in England.

23
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,801
And I taught in Camden Town for

24
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:28,996
those of you who know the area in schools
with more than 250 languages spoken.

25
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:29,794
In the U.S.

26
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,930
I've taught maths to seventh and eighth
grade students and

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,570
also to undergraduates at Stanford so lots
of levels of math.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,170
So, I've said that this course is for
teachers and parents,

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,220
that's because its not a course on how to
teach with the detailed ideas for

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,700
teaching although there are some of those.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,189
But its really a course with short input
from me, most sessions are about 15 or

32
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,470
20 minutes long.

33
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,174
I think I said in the description they'd
be ten to 15 minutes but

34
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:59,990
I got a bit excited about the ideas that I
could show you.

35
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,403
And so, I'm going to show you some
research ideas that have

36
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:06,960
recently emerged that i think could be
really helpful for every body.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,180
So, this course is some what experimental.

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,660
Your my first time in trying this and were
in it together.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,260
I would welcome input on what is or isn't
useful to you.

40
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,010
Which of the ideas would be most useful
for

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,220
the student of course which is the one
I'll work on next.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,488
I'd really like us to be a community of
learners and

43
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:30,470
the intro video that you can see on how
the course works.

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,602
Tells you about the forum and the other
places that we can connect, and

45
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:37,370
there's going to be some live chat
sessions to.

46
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,400
So, it's hard to design a class for such a
broad range of people.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,406
But my hope is that even if I give you one
or

48
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:48,050
two key ideas, they can change something
you do in the classroom.

49
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,804
Or in interaction you can have with your
own children that may

50
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,314
actually make a huge difference for them
in their mathematical trajectory as

51
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:59,080
you'll find out from the ideas I'll show
you.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,942
I'm going to be helped in teaching this
course by

53
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:05,150
some really interesting individuals who I
interviewed for the course.

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,456
And they're going to be sharing their
experiences of using maths out in

55
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,160
the world, and of, learning maths.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,770
So, we have Michelle Sandburg who's a
pediatrician.

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,588
Sebastian Thrun, he designed the self
driving cars for Google.

58
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:26,030
He's also a Stanford professor, and the
CEO of Udacity, an online company.

59
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,510
Chris, who's a software engineer, at
Udacity.

60
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,970
Emily is a team leader at Apple, she leads
a team of engineers.

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,490
And Sophie is a film maker and they are
going to come in and

62
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,060
out of the course as you will see.

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,138
I have also introduced Carol Dweck who is
the guru on mind sets and

64
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:46,750
you will be seeing some of her.

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,834
So, it would really help me in moving
forward if I can collect some data from

66
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,530
you about who you are, your motives for
taking the course.

67
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,142
I am going to ask you now to stop and

68
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,795
complete the survey that I'll will direct
you to.

69
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,555
And this survey's really important so

70
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,810
I'd really appreciate if you would
complete this.
