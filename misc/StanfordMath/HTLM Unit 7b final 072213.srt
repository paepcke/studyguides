1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,750
So, I can think of a few reasons.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's see if they match yours.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,500
Or maybe you have better ones.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,685
I would say that algebra is a language for
expressing the world, and we need it,

5
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,830
particularly in the new world we're living
in.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,638
Also, algebra is a tool for solving
problems, although many don't think of

7
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:18,800
it that way, because of the way it's
introduced to them.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
And then, the, my third reason is that
Algebra helps us think abstractly.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,060
And that learning to think outside of
numbers with abstract ideas is

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,800
really critical.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,352
It is going to be at the center of many
careers in this new age.

12
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:34,947
And jobs that don't even exist now,

13
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:39,790
that we can't even think about, are going
to be based on this abstract thinking.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,950
But the failure rates in algebra,

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,015
failure that sets a student on a low-level
pathway, is completely changeable.

16
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,808
And in this session, I'm going to set out
important core principles for

17
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:53,111
teaching algebra that come from research
evidence, and

18
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:57,950
that apply to all levels of algebra from
elementary to college.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,480
I'll set out those principles first, and

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,300
then we'll look at some examples of those
principles in action in classrooms.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,818
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,446
So, one of the clearest and

23
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:10,108
most repeated research results is that
students have great difficulties,

24
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:16,890
moving from what's described as procedural
algebra to structural algebra.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,670
And here's the difference between those
two.

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,384
Procedural algebra involves representing a
letter as

27
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:25,950
a single unknown number that students
find.

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,458
Most algebra textbooks bombard students at
the beginning of their learning,

29
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,860
with questions like, find x when 7x plus 4
equals 32.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,144
A structural approach to algebra involves
using symbols, such as letters,

31
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:44,473
to express generality in a situation.

32
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:48,426
So, the big idea of algebra and the
concept that will help students more

33
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:53,350
than any in work and life, is this idea of
generalization.

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,575
So, when students work with growing
patterns, as we have looked at before, and

35
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,280
they're asked to describe grows, they can
be introduced to the use of

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,580
algebra as a really useful tool that helps
them solve that problem.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,710
So, a question for you now is, how do you
see this shape growing?

38
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,030
Can you find the number of square in case
100, or in case n?
