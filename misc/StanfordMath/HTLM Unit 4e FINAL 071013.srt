1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,947
So, we found that those differences in the
task lead to different forms of

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:07,481
engagement and different learning
opportunities with a visual version,

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:11,072
helping students see the meaning of
variables, and understand functional

4
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:17,310
growth as a function, instead of just
looking down the columns of the table.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,550
They also differ on this learning
performing dimension with one

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,580
really encouraging growth and learning.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,630
The other appearing to have one
performance answer that can

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,350
quickly be found.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,484
So you can make that change from a
performance task to

10
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:37,590
a growth mindset task or a learning task
with any math task.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,342
And in fact my student Dan Meyer has been
compiling some great versions on his site,

12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,165
and that's a link to that site here.

13
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,621
So, I'm going to give you a peer
assignment now which is

14
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:53,005
something you'll do and you'll see a
peer's work and, and

15
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:59,270
give a comment on that and you'll get a
comment back to yours.

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,431
And my assignment is, I want you to come
up with an example of your own,

17
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:08,130
a task that starts off as closed and
short.

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,810
And encouraging fixed mindset thinking,

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,570
I'm sure you can just think of one of
those easily.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,140
And then, a way of adapting that to make
it more of a growth mindset task.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,730
So I'd like you to write those down, write
about that process.
