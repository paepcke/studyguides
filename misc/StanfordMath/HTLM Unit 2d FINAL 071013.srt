1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,762
As well as the huge implications we've
seen for all students achievement,

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:08,680
there are serious implications of mindset
work for equity.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,279
So we know that after mindset
interventions, African American students

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,410
show the sharpest increase in grades and
in valuing school.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,340
We also know that a growth mindset
eliminates any gender gaps in performance.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,952
Even in the highest SAT levels,

7
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:26,672
the very top level where there still
gender differences, we know that if

8
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:32,771
we only look at growth mindset students,
those gender differences disappear.

9
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,652
We know too at the end of eighth grade, or

10
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:38,642
the research showed us that at the end of
eighth grade when they follow students,

11
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:44,248
there was only a gender gap in maths
amongst fixed mindset students.

12
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:46,192
Interestingly, Carol Dreck and

13
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:51,948
the other researchers, studied, as well,
calculus at Columbia.

14
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:53,240
So at the University level.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,715
And they found that in calculus classes,
first of all,

16
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:58,247
stereotyping was alive and well.

17
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,383
Women have been through university math
departments can probably identify

18
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:03,020
with that.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,436
But they found that the stereotype
messages that the women received only

20
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:10,188
effected those with a fixed mindset and
when they received those messages their

21
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:13,436
confidence eroded and they abandoned plans
to pursue STEM subjects,

22
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:17,020
whereas those with a growth mindset were
able to deal with those messages and

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,138
continue pursuing the STEM subjects.

24
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:25,792
So seeing maths as a gift not only makes
students vulnerable to lack of

25
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:30,310
confidence but vulnerable to stereotypes,
too.

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:36,940
And having a growth mindset is what we
want all students and teachers to have.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,995
So, the big message, intelligence is
malleable.

28
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,185
But, students, teachers, schools,

29
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:47,510
parents tend to treat math learners As
though it's relatively fixed.

30
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,550
So some questions for you now.
