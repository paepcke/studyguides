1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,510
Okay, so this is Cathy writing about the
dot card number talks.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,706
Okay.
Now we're going to look at

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,420
a number number talk.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,092
And as you watch this video, you're going
to see Cathy enact a number of practices,

5
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:17,230
or what we might call teacher moves that
are really important in number talks.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,944
So keep a note or a mental note of what
you think they are,

7
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:23,366
because after the video I'm going to ask
you to write them down, and

8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:27,590
also comment on someone else's submission.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,536
So this is going to be like a pair
assessment type of writing.

10
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:34,500
>> We're going to try a different number
talk this time.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,140
And this time it's with numbers, and it's
going to be multiplication.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,459
Okay?

13
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:44,959
So get ready to think and

14
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:51,009
the problem is [NOISE] and

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:59,259
if your thumb is already up you might

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:08,334
try to see if you could see it a different

17
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:17,463
way.

18
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:26,359
Okay, so I'm seeing

19
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:33,031
most people's

20
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:40,553
thumbs.

21
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:45,570
Is anybody willing to share what they
think the answer might be?

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,520
Okay, Joe.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,032
What do you think?

24
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,878
>> 720.

25
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:57,116
>> Does anybody have another idea

26
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:03,395
about what the answer might be.

27
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,412
>> Okay, Shay?

28
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:06,847
>> 725.

29
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,030
>> I changed my answer.

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,918
[LAUGH]
>> Hold on.

31
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:19,270
Does anyone have an idea, a different idea
about what the answer might be?

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,848
Okay, so Joe, what's the matter?

33
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:25,280
>> What I, I realized what I did.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,724
I I think Shannon probably both got to
750, but

35
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:33,890
she accurately subtracted 25, and I
subtracted 30.

36
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,154
Cause I was confused by the rounding I was
doing from 29 to 30.

37
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:37,800
>> That's good.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,375
That's good.
You were, so I want I'll have you,

39
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,986
actually, so you're saying that you
want to disagree with this answer?

40
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,440
>> yeah, I want to disagree with my
answer, yes.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,568
>> Okay.
And so you're agreeing at the answer, 725?

42
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,216
>> Yes.
>> Okay, so

43
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,555
let's go through your method then, Joe and
you could show us what you did wrong.

44
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:54,806
>> What I did was I rounded 29 to 30, to
make it a friendly number.

45
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:58,382
>> Okay, so we're doing 25 times 29.

46
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:03,136
But you decided to do 25 times 30 to
>> Mm-hm.

47
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:04,064
>> Because?

48
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,278
>> Because 30's a friendly number and
>> Okay.

49
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:08,938
>> And it's easier to multiply with.

50
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,594
>> Alright.
>> And

51
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:15,732
then what I did, was I broke 25 up into 10
plus 10, plus 5.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,464
So, what that does is you can multiply 30
by each of those numbers, so

53
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:32,935
that turns into 300 plus 300 plus 150.

54
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,797
So you multiplied 30 times each one of
those numbers.

55
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:39,439
>> Yes.

56
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,830
>> 10 plus 10 plus 5, okay, and then.

57
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,332
So, 30 times 10 is 300, plus 30 times 10
which is 300,

58
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:54,112
plus 30 times 5, which is 150.

59
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,404
>> Okay.

60
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:59,732
>> So I added those up and that equals
750.

61
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,708
>> Okay.

62
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:10,135
>> And then I knew, because I rounded 29
up to 30 I had to subtract a number, and.

63
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,280
>> I think I just got a little confused.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,305
Instead of subtracting the 25 which is
what I'm really doing here,

65
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:20,245
multiplying by an extra, you know, adding
an extra 25 in the multiplication.

66
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:23,023
>> How do you know you're adding an extra
25 in the multiplication?

67
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:32,536
>> Because I'm doing 25 times 30, which is
25 times 29 plus 25.

68
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,406
>> okay.

69
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,202
>> Yeah.

70
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,220
>> So, you added too many 25s.

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,095
>> Yes, exactly.

72
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,340
>> And you want to take away one.

73
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,180
>> And I want to take away 25,

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,280
which would yield

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,281
>> So, you got
>> Yeah.

76
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,195
>> And then you got?

77
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:46,120
>> That would be 725.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,296
But, I accidentally did minus 30.

79
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,634
>> Than mine.

80
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,480
>> But you almost didn't.

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,618
>> Confusion and then that would've.

82
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:52,295
>> That's an interesting.

83
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:52,970
>> That's why I thought it was.

84
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,510
>> Mistake though.

85
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,268
Minus 30.

86
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,170
>> Yes it is and.

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,960
>> Where do you think the 30.

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,351
What were you thinking?

89
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:57,909
Were you thinking.

90
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,545
>> The thing I just.
>> This?

91
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,825
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, I got confused, I think about,

92
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:06,460
about which number in the original
equation I was adding an extra of.

93
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,185
>> Yeah, that's really complicated.

94
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:09,910
>> Did anybody have the same experience?

95
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,120
Did anybody else round up to 30?

96
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,381
Oh really?
Do you want to talk about what you did?

97
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,885
You don't, Geraldine,, who does want to
talk about what they did?

98
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,329
Okay, Joe and then.

99
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,909
>> Yes, similar to Joe,

100
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:26,749
25 times 30 was my first initial exaction
to create two friendly numbers.

101
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:29,611
but, you know, knowing there's, there's
ways in math that we cut,

102
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,026
we take quick shortcuts,
>> Yeah.

103
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:36,058
>> So knowing that 30 may sit, where, to,
or for me, to actually do it sometimes in

104
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:40,818
my head, so I just cut the zero off and
made 25 times 3.

105
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,966
So I made it into quarters almost.

106
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,407
>> So three quarters.

107
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:47,315
>> So you were thinking three quarters.

108
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,853
>> Yeah, so that way, because I know in
the future I will then add the zero,

109
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:56,805
knowing that that rule applies to all
equations multiplied by a zero at the end.

110
00:05:56,805 --> 00:06:03,665
>> So when you did 25 times 29, you, you
did...

111
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,532
>> I did same thing at 25 times 30.

112
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,380
>> Times 30.

113
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,025
But then you were thinking of quarters.

114
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,147
>> Yeah, 25 times 3.

115
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:12,880
>> So were you thinking of 3 times 25.

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,340
So you're thinking of three quarters?

117
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,038
>> Yeah.
That means 25 is yeah, rings, you know,

118
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,300
quarters in my head.

119
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,030
>> Okay, so three quarters.

120
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,150
And you knew that was 75.

121
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,766
>> 75.
It's like I said it's almost yeah.

122
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,849
>> And then.

123
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,749
>> So now, I mean now I cut it to half the
equation already because knowing

124
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,545
the No-Zero Rule.

125
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,244
>> When you multiply something by a 0 you
just add on the 0.

126
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:33,210
>> When you multiply.

127
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,050
>> So you know, I just kind of did Jones'
method, but

128
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,246
instead of breaking it down and

129
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:40,948
decomposing it I just tried to simplify
the equation and then apply the rule of 0.

130
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:41,990
>> Okay let me rewind you.

131
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,937
I, did you, I think I heard you say when
I,

132
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,276
when you multiply something by 0 you add a
0?

133
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:50,634
>> Yeah, well anything, anything you
multiply, well I just know in...

134
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:53,541
Anything by 10, 20, or 30 you can, you
know, cut the zero off and

135
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,132
just multiply it by the three or two or
one, depending on the number it is, and

136
00:06:57,132 --> 00:07:03,044
then once you get that number you can just
add on the zero at the end.

137
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,020
>> Oh, so you weren't multiplying by zero.

138
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,502
You were multiplying by a.

139
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:07,194
>> Two, yes.

140
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,634
>> A multiple of ten.

141
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,438
>> Multiple of ten.

142
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:10,747
>> okay.
>> What I guess I'm trying to say is

143
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:14,106
that I definitely broke it down so that I
was probably by, at the tens.

144
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:14,828
>> Okay.

145
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:15,948
So the 25 times, times 3,

146
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:20,020
the three quarters helped you know, help
you think about the 750.

147
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,610
>> Yeah.

148
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,635
Just to make it more friendly of an
equation.

149
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:24,010
>> Okay.
Then that's what we're after.

150
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,170
And so, what Did you do then?

151
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,362
>> Yeah, well you know, same resident,
realizing that Joe had,

152
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:32,946
is that you know because I round up, I'm
rounding, I am multiplying one more 25

153
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:38,494
than necessary, and so I have to track
that 25 away from seven, 750.

154
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,394
So 750 minus 25, just so

155
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:47,237
that similar to Joe, it's similar to 75,
25 times 30 minus 25.

156
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:51,270
>> Okay.
>> There's very similar, Okay.

157
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,125
Who did it a completely different way.

158
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,894
Okay, Vivian, want to go?

159
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:02,790
>> I took 25 times 20.

160
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,516
So I guess basically I took apart 20, 29
and made it 20 and

161
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:10,398
9 first
>> And so I did 25 times 20.

162
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:14,293
>> Okay, so you took, you multiplied 25.

163
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:20,429
>> Yes, and I did it kind of similar to
Julio in that I just took the 0 off with

164
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:29,912
the rule of 10s, so like I took it off and
did 24 times 2 and I got 50.

165
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,816
Okay.

166
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,930
>> And then I added the zero back that I'd
taken away.

167
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,632
So I got 500.

168
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:37,231
>> So if 25 times two is 50, then 25 times
20 is 500.

169
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:38,812
Okay.
>> And then from there,

170
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:42,510
I applied the quarter, the quarter rule.

171
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:51,105
So I knew that four would make 100.

172
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,390
>> So I knew that

173
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,082
>> You knew that four
>> Four 25 would make 100, okay.

174
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,950
>> So four groups of 25, if you add them
together will make a hundred.

175
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,290
So I saw that there were two groups of
four so that was 200.

176
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,564
So I had 700.

177
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:08,011
500 plus 200 is 700.

178
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,300
>> Okay rewind for a second.

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,626
Where did you see the two groups of four
quarters?

180
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,649
>> In the 9.

181
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,666
>> And the nine.

182
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,714
>> Yup.
>> So when you broke up the 29,

183
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:20,612
you broke it into you were thinking about
29 as

184
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:21,362
>> 20 and

185
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,574
nine

186
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:25,428
>> 20 plus nine
>> hm.

187
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:26,142
>> Okay.

188
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,242
>> And then I broke the nine up

189
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,298
into four four
>> Okay so

190
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:32,342
then you broke the nine up into fours?

191
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:32,878
>> 4?

192
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:35,475
>> 4 4 and 1
>> Plus 4 plus 1.

193
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,189
>> Mmhm.

194
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,620
>> Okay now I'm up with you.

195
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,125
Then what?

196
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,865
>> Yeah.
And so I knew that each of the 4s

197
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:44,763
would represent 100 because I was
multiplying it by 25.

198
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:50,422
>> So I knew 4 times 25 is 100, 4 times 25
is 100, that would make 200.

199
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,254
>> So I addd that 200 to the 500.

200
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:58,384
>> Okay, so this really represents for you
4 times 25, and

201
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:04,566
this represents 4 times 25, and then the
1?

202
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:05,216
>> 25.

203
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,105
I just [CROSSTALK] 1 and the 2.

204
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,020
>> 25 times 25.

205
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,008
Okay, and so going back here then this 9
actually means 9 times 25...

206
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:15,136
>> Yeah, okay.

207
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:15,860
Whew.

208
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,544
Okay, now what?

209
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:20,990
>> Well, as I said before I took the 200
from 4 times 25 plus 4 times 25,

210
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,830
add it to the 500.

211
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,680
>> Okay so you knew that this was 100 and
100 and that was 200, and

212
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,587
you added that to.

213
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,317
>> To the 500.

214
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:34,215
>> The 500 you had here, okay, 500,
okay...

215
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,424
>> And that gave me 700.

216
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,884
>> Okay.

217
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,765
>> And then there was that one 25 left.

218
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,411
>> Okay.
>> And that I added onto it, and

219
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,406
I got 725.

220
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:43,958
>> Okay.

221
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,580
>> How are we doing on time?

222
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,846
Have us think about some of the properties
we talked about.

223
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:56,060
And so I You've broken up numbers in a lot
of different ways.

224
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,820
And so I, what I'd like, I'm going to do
is I'm going to draw a picture for

225
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,320
what I think Joe saw first up here.

226
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,030
A diagram.

227
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,495
>> And if this is 25 Joe, Joe as you, s-,
you saw the 29, but

228
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:20,386
then you added one more on there?

229
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:22,150
>> Oh, Yeah.

230
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,476
>> So, you multiplied 25 times 30 and then
you subtracted the 25.

231
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:28,092
>> Yeah.

232
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:33,996
>> So, this part went out and this was 25
plus 1.

233
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,618
Does anybody know what property that is?

234
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,520
What Joe did?

235
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,190
How you would write it alegebraically?

236
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,070
Talk to each other real quick.

237
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,865
See how you would write

238
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:56,573
this alegebraically.

239
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,976
[CROSSTALK]

240
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:03,143
[INAUDIBLE]
Too bad we

241
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:11,740
don't have the mics on every table.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,385
Is anybody willing to say what property is
and how it works?

243
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:20,648
>> We thought it was a distributive
property, because.

244
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,627
>> You want to say why, Kellan?

245
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,350
>> Yeah.

246
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,920
He, since Joe added 1.

247
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,034
>> Hang on, let me just write it up here.

248
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:34,945
>> He's now taking his 25 and multiplying
it by both 29 and 1.

249
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:38,090
>> Okay, so how would you write that?

250
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,947
Do you.

251
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:44,954
>> 25 times, and then with parenthesis, 29
plus 1.

252
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:49,170
>> 19, which is the original problem, plus
1 that he added.

253
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,745
Okay.

254
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,411
>> And then he's distributing the 25
across the [CROSSTALK] multiplied with

255
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,663
the 21-
>> 25 times 29?

256
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:54,700
[CROSSTALK] 120.

257
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,070
Okay, good.

258
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,880
What about one more.

259
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,270
Let's see, I just.

260
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,210
Oh, let's, let's see, Julio uses three
quarters, Joe.

261
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,730
Vivian, how, how would you write Vivian's
on using the distributive property?

262
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,500
Talk that one over.

263
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,820
And pre-, draw on the desk,

264
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,021
pretend with your finger how you would
draw a picture for this.

265
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:18,834
[CROSSTALK]
>> Wait, say that again.

266
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:22,095
>> Wait, I didn't say that.

267
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:27,652
>> 20 and 9, so it would be 25 times 20,
plus.

268
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:28,606
>> 20.

269
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:33,646
>> 25 times nine, although [INAUDIBLE]
[CROSSTALK] [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE]

270
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,135
>> It would really be 21.

271
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:48,416
[CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE]
>> Yeah, it's just.

272
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,397
[CROSSTALK]
>> Yeah.

273
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,117
>> Is anybody willing, that we haven't
heard from yet,

274
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:54,815
to talk, explain this for us?

275
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,364
>> Stephanie, great.

276
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:58,840
Thank you.

277
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,640
So, explaining what would be the equation
or the picture.

278
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,350
>> Yeah, well, you could do the picture or
the equation, either one.

279
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,160
We can do both separately if you'd like.

280
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,810
Okay, so first it would, so

281
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:14,550
it'd be 25 and then, the 29 would be
broken up into 20 plus 4 plus 4 plus 1.

282
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,190
So twenty from oh this is badly out of
whack.

283
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,990
[LAUGH] It'd more like that.

284
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,096
That's four plus one but you're saying
this is oh well.

285
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:31,982
Is that what you are saying Stephanie?

286
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,100
>> Okay.

287
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,320
So, this whole thing is still 29, but
those are the separate pieces.

288
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,190
Okay, then how would we write
algebraically?

289
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,668
Somebody else?

290
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:52,567
>> Okay Erin try.

291
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,793
>> I guess it would be 25 times.

292
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,710
>> I feel like I need a different colored
pen somewhere.

293
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,935
Okay I'm going to write it over here then.

294
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:00,508
>> Okay.

295
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,283
>> So 25 times.

296
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:08,372
>> Times the quantity of 20 plus 4 plus 4
plus 1.

297
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,658
>> What do you think?

298
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,501
Okay.
Good.

299
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:18,172
We are done with our number talk.

300
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:22,332
Thank you

301
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:28,582
very much.
