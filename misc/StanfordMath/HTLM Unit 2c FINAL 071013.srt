1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,823
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:10,915
When Carol Dweck published this book in
2007, it quickly became a New York Times

3
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:15,636
best seller, and it really started a
revolution in education.

4
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:19,038
I don't know of any research volume that's
had such an impact, and

5
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:22,188
in there she reported that there are two
ways of thinking and

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,100
people fall into one of two groups.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,450
There are those people who have a fixed
mindset and those people believe that you

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,400
have a certain amount of intelligence that
you really can't change, so

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,740
math's ability is a gift.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,008
And then there are those who have a growth
mindset,

11
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:42,290
who believe that math's ability and
smartness grows with experience.

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,645
So it turns out that these two beliefs
have huge implications for learning and

13
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,230
for students.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,632
Those people with a growth mindset, it
turns out are persistent,

15
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:58,720
they learn from mistakes, and they're
encouraged by other people's success.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,420
But those were the fixed mindset hate to
fail thus it tells on

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,850
that they are not smart and they will
avoid challenging work at all costs.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,059
Now these mindset beliefs effects students
from across the achievement spectrum.

19
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:14,595
In fact high achieving goals all are from
the worst hit by fixed mindset, thinking

20
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:20,300
and that's affects them really badly when
they come to choose courses and careers.

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,756
Students can have these mindsets from the
time they are about 3 years old, and

22
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:29,210
one of the reasons is that many parents
praise their children for being smart.

23
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,905
Now they do that with the best intentions,
but when they do that and

24
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:35,909
they say oh, you're so smart, children
think, oh, good I'm smart.

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,080
But when they later fail, and they will,
they think oh, I'm not so smart.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,600
So it's important always to praise what
students have done, not them.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
Say wow, that's great that you've learned
that, or

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,390
it's great that you've learned to do that.

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,045
And Carol's book has many more ideas on
that.

30
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,717
And as she mentions in her interview, they
found that the praise given to babies in

31
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:59,173
the first three years of their life
predicts their mind set five years later,

32
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:02,292
so it's really important.

33
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:07,020
And it turns out that praise can impact
students immediately.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,115
In one of Carol's studies they did
experiments with 400 fifth graders, and

35
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:13,572
they were asked to take an easy, short
test, and

36
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:17,610
almost all of them performed well.

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,580
And half the children were praised for
being really smart.

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,130
The other half were complimented on having
worked really hard.

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,478
Then, they were asked to take a second
test and they were told they

40
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:31,384
could choose one that was pretty simple
and that they would do well on or they

41
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:38,080
could choose one that was more challenging
but they might make mistakes on it.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,296
90% of those praised for effort chose the
harder test, but

43
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:45,345
of those smart, the majority chose the
easy test.

44
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:50,750
So, let's look at some of the really
interesting data on mindset in students.

45
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,580
So this graph shows what happens when
students received an intervention.

46
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,609
It turns out students for

47
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,640
four months declined through seventh grade
but the intervention stopped that.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,210
And those that graph shows only what
happened from a mindset intervention.

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,730
The students have the same math teachers
and the same curriculum.

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,095
So that intervention and

51
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:14,530
all sorts of other useful advice, is on
the Brainology website.

52
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,743
So, a question I want you to answer now,

53
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,430
which is slightly different to the last
one,.

54
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,626
Some of, many of you may have seen the
data I've just shown you on mindset before

55
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:27,430
as Carol's book is so popular, but maybe
not all of it before.

56
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,410
And I want us to stop and think now, and
think about if student.

57
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,460
If schools took on this mindset evidence
seriously, what would they need to change?

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,940
So write about schools now, even if you
wrote about schools before.

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,460
And make your answer local to your own
situation or

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,020
the schools you know in your districts and
country.
