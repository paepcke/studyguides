00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,510
George Polya, a world leading
mathematician, wrote a short book called

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:10,140
How to Solve It, in which he goes through
a very important problem solving process.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,250
And it has many similarities with my
thinking process.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,825
And his headings are these, now of course
the important details from him,

5
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,520
inside those headings.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,550
And you can easily find his processes by
doing a quick web search.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,920
In mathematics, people have found Polya's
strategies are enormously helpful, but

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,810
they've generally being seen as useful for
solving big problems.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,860
Whereas I'm arguing that theirs a thinking
in every mathematical question.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,819
[MUSIC]

11
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:53,720
So I want to spend the moment now on the
collaboration piece.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,996
Because collaboration gives students
conceptual insight in

13
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:59,700
an amazingly powerful way.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,747
Have you ever been stuck about something,
anything, not necessarily mathematical,

15
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:09,540
and told someone about it, and suddenly
you have the insight that you needed?

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,548
Or maybe you've asked a student in a
classroom to repeat a question to you, and

17
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:16,700
as they repeat that question they suddenly
realize what they need to do.

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,887
As people have an idea in mathematics or

19
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:24,820
a solution path and then they hear another
person's idea or solution path.

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,844
They are invited in those moments to make
connections and

21
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:32,110
to think conceptually about mathematical
processes.

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,070
These are a critical part of mathematical
thinking.

23
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,674
Mary, one of my students, is talking here
about the conceptual insights she got in

24
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,900
college from hearing other people's
thoughts and

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,936
the way that considering others, other
people's methods, helped her.

26
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:52,215
>> I found in college it's very helpful to
work in groups on problems.

27
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,910
It's easier when you can talk it over with
other people, and

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,863
understand their methods of doing it.

29
00:01:57,863 --> 00:02:02,133
In high school, I felt like the problems
we were doing were all very structured in

30
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:06,760
the sense that there was only one layer to
do it, maybe.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,975
I mean, there were obviously more than
one, but there was.

32
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:13,526
>> A pretty obvious method to solve it but
in college these problems, there are many

33
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:18,729
ways that are valid to solve them, so it
was cool to see the different ones, and.

34
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,044
>> So the research study that shows the
power of collaboration, more than any for

35
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:25,563
me was conducted by Uri Treisman, although
there have been many important studies

36
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:29,170
showing the importance of collaboration.

37
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,690
At the time Uri was a mathematics
professor at Berkeley.

38
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,550
He's now at the University of Texas,
Austin.

39
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,278
And zuti realized, when he was at
Berkeley,

40
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,582
that large numbers of students were
failing calculus and

41
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:45,340
dropping out of the university, and mostly
those students were African-American.

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,680
Rather than just accepting that, as some
have,

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,269
he questioned why there was such a
difference, and he particularly looked.

44
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,813
The differences between African-American
students and

45
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:59,480
Chinese students, who are much more
successful.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,031
So we set about to study those two groups
of students and we found that there was no

47
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:06,423
difference in the schools they came in
with, in the background knowledge and

48
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:13,290
their motivation at college and their
income, but there was one big difference.

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,260
The Chinese students did maths together.

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,505
They would meet after classes, and they
would have meals together, and

51
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:23,880
in those social situations they would work
on their maths problems.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,890
So having found that, we instigated a
series of workshops where students work

53
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,640
collaboratively and they particularly
brought in minority students.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,062
So in these workshops white students were
in the minority, and

55
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:39,420
the results were dramatic.

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,502
The black and Latino students in these
workshops started outperforming those

57
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:50,440
with similar and even those who had higher
SAT scores.

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,063
So, black students with SAT scores in the
low 600s started outperforming white and

59
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:58,692
Asian students who were in the mid 700s.

60
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:03,224
Soon, 200 students a year took the
workshops.

61
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:07,046
Uri moved to UT Austin and set up the
workshops again and

62
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:13,340
at that university minorities now have an
average GPA of 3.53.

63
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,390
Compared to an average of 1.66, and they
now have a 100 Latino, and

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,630
Black math majors each year.

65
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,170
In fact most of our minority
mathematicians in the United States now

66
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,010
come from Austin.

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,350
So that's a really important study for
equity reasons.

68
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,626
I also shows clearly that when the
students discuss mathematics problems,

69
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:39,100
Talking about why they chose their
methods, thinking about why they work.

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,229
It promotes reasoning, sense making, and
conceptual growth.

71
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,114
There should be considerable time in every
single mathematics class for

72
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:51,500
students to discuss the mathematical
ideas.

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,704
Otherwise they're missing out on

74
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:55,589
one of the most important learning
experiences they can have.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,720
So I'd like you to write down your top 3
reasons why you think it helps students to

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,760
discuss mathematics with others.
