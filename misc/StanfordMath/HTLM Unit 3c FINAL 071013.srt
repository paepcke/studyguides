1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,997
So in a moment we're going to think about
ways of making maths environments great

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:06,570
spaces for learning from mistakes.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,910
But first I want you to think about, about
why mistakes are so helpful.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,911
So, first, the first reason, pure and

5
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:18,520
simple is that the students learn most in
those moments, as I've said.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,058
Now that means that it's really important
that they are given difficult,

7
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:25,886
challenging work, work that they can
access, that's going to be a challenge for

8
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:30,430
them, not work that they can get all
correct.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,868
They may fe-, they may feel good about
getting work correct, but

10
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:36,020
as Carol Duex says, it's really cheating
them.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,476
Of the important learning experiences, so
in a study I conducted in England I

12
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:42,230
followed students through two schools over
three years, and

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,848
in one of the schools students are taught
traditionally with demonstration and

14
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:49,034
practice and exercises and in the other
school students were given big

15
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:54,650
open problems to work on and solve, so
that's...

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,290
Approaches also known as PBL, or Problem
Based Learning.

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,740
They didn't really know how to solve them,
and sometimes they were given choices of

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,140
problems, they were encouraged always to
choose the ones that were difficult for

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,128
them, and then they just came up with
ideas.

20
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:12,088
So they were learning math to solve
problems, and if they needed some new

21
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:18,320
math methods The teacher would teach it to
them in the context of the problem.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,966
So the typical method in classrooms is
students taught methods,

23
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,760
then they solve problems.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,592
But in this classroom students got big
open problems, and

25
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:29,420
then they learned the methods to help them
solve them.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,732
The students started at these two schools
at the same levels in maths achievement,

27
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,748
but the students at the problem based
schools,

28
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:39,410
ended up scoring at significantly higher
levels on the national exam.

29
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,368
And I was able to follow up and find the
students eight years later, and

30
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,310
they also ended up in more professional
jobs.

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,976
Now I wanted to know why.

32
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,450
That was really interesting to me.

33
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,130
And I interviewed many of the adults.

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,595
And when I interviewed them they talked
about how they'd really taken their

35
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,720
problem solving approach into their jobs
and lives.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,408
And there's a paper in the reference
section that gives you more detail on all

37
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,790
of that.

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,008
But this is one of the young adults I

39
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,290
caught up with from the problem-based
school.

40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,770
Talking about seeing a maths problem at
work.

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,160
So I asked him.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,664
What happens if you don't know how to do
something with maths when you're in

43
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:17,400
your work?

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,530
And actually this was a young woman.

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,780
And she said, I, I keep on going until I
do.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,440
Because I wouldn't.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,300
If something is.

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,170
If I can't do it, then it annoys me.

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,190
I need to see something through, really,
until the end.

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,400
So I need to understand how I've done it.

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,220
And if I don't immediately understand it,

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,935
then I will just keep on going at it until
I do understand it.

53
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,063
So this student I'm going to quote from
now is actually,

54
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:45,480
this interview came from during their time
in school.

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,574
And for this boy, I asked them to reflect
on the exams and

56
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:53,560
how they got on with the exams.

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,990
Because they never did exam-like
questions.

58
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,205
They only did these big projects.

59
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:00,397
They exam like questions a few weeks
before the national exam ad, so

60
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:04,220
I asked them what happens when you go into
the exams.

61
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,150
And he said, I tend to go into them
anyways just thinking that I can do them.

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,808
Yeah, I there wasn't any time I thought,
well this is this, this is this,

63
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:17,003
I just worked it out from the knowledge
that I had.

64
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:21,157
So the students at Phoenix Park as I call
the school never as I said, they didn't on

65
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:27,243
exam [UNKNOWN] questions and they didn't
do tests either in the school.

66
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:30,730
So they only saw those kinds of questions
in the run up to the end of school at 16.

67
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,183
So both of these quotes I think you'll
probably agree show an attitude and

68
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,906
an approach to math That came about from a
learning culture in

69
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:46,120
which students were rewarded for
experimentation and for trying things.

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,503
Not for correct answers, but for having
ideas and trying things out.

71
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,040
And that meant that they did better.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,200
They did better in the National Exams, and
they did better in life.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,734
So, what did it take to get them to have
that wonderful confidence and

74
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:02,345
that persistence that helped them in life?

75
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:06,050
What it took was an approach to maths
learning that was about problem solving,

76
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,615
trying things out, uncertainty, making
mistakes and

77
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,990
feeling good about them, because teachers
valued them.

78
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:19,040
And as I said, the references on that
study are in the reference section.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,311
So, this seems a good point to stop and

80
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,935
listen to some of the interview I
conducted with Carol Dweck, especially for

81
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,862
maths teachers and parents.

82
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:28,986
And after entry I'm going to get you to
write down some of

83
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:34,382
the key ideas that you heard and would
like to take further.

84
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:38,855
>> My first piece of advice is to present
math as somehting that is learned it is

85
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,908
a learned set of skills And that when kids
strugle or

86
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:46,381
get confused they should understand that
with more effort and practice and

87
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:53,907
help from teachers, they will continue to
learn from these skills.

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,612
math is typically seen by students as
something you have or

89
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,078
you don't, your good at it or your not.

90
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:05,990
That's not true.

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,030
Everyone can get better at math when they
work on it.

92
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,860
And we don't know how good you're going to
be in the future if you work on it now.

93
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,838
It's really important for teachers to show
students the progress they've made.

94
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:26,982
I think psychologically when a student is
confused or struggling,

95
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:34,110
it feels as if there's no progress being
made, as if they're back at square one.

96
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,403
So, a great thing for teachers to do is to
keep track of the progress that students

97
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:47,450
have made Over the whole year or over that
unit and to show it to them all the time.

98
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,990
You've learned these things before and you
will learn them again.

99
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,818
Also, I think it's important that when
teachers give

100
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:05,283
specific feedback to students, they show
the student how to use that feedback.

101
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:11,230
To become better at this kind of problem
and to be become better t math.

102
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,505
The basic idea is that you can learn to be
better and better at math and

103
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:22,210
the teacher's feedback should always be
conveying that message.

104
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,740
One thing that we're studying now is the
word Yet...

105
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,412
So if teachers say, no,

106
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:36,380
not quite yet, you're still learning,
you're on that learning curve.

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,100
You're just not there yet.

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,348
And I think it's a very hopeful message
that keeps that time dimension,

109
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:45,869
that learning curve in the picture.

110
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:53,660
I think we've made a huge mistake in our
child-rearing practices.

111
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,580
In our education system.

112
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,798
We tell kids they should feel good when
things were easy for them, and

113
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:03,850
they got everything right.

114
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,240
That's a cause for celebration.

115
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,340
Not in my book.

116
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,990
In my book it means, you're not learning
as much as you could.

117
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,880
If it was easy, well, you probably already
knew how to do it.

118
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,920
If you didn't put in effort, you weren't
growing those math neurons.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,815
We should make kids feel cheated.

120
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,775
If the work is too easy for them, or

121
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:33,630
if the teachers gloss over their errors
and don't give them good feedback.

122
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,440
We should have kids asking for harder
work, wanting the challenging problems.

123
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,410
I want challenge to become the new comfort
zone, not easy.

124
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,440
Being the comfort zone.

125
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,124
I'll never forget at the beginning of my
research career when a little boy

126
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,170
said- should I start that again.

127
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,602
I'll never forget at the beginning of my

128
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:06,130
research career when a little boy said,
mistakes are our friend.

129
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,694
I was really struck by the beauty of that
message and all children should feel

130
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:18,202
that mistakes don't condemn them, mistakes
are not things they should flee from,

131
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:23,305
mistakes are a natural part of learning
And often give us clues about what we

132
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:32,348
have done wrong, what we need to learn,
and what we should do next.

133
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:38,224
There's a wonderful relatively new brain
imaging study where

134
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:45,845
they looked, it's actually an EEG study,
they looked at...

135
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:52,310
Fixed mind set brains solving problems and
making mistakes.

136
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,388
And when the student was in a fixed mind
set and

137
00:08:55,388 --> 00:09:01,540
made an error, they fled from that error
as quickly as possible.

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,688
But when they looked at growth mind set
students making errors, they Focused in

139
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:13,000
on the error, they processed it deeply,
and they corrected it.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,310
So they got it right on the next trial.

141
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,600
That's what we want.

142
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,970
We want an error to be something that you
glom on to, and learn from.

143
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,739
We have Found that teaching a growth
mindset is really, important for

144
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:32,740
math achievement.

145
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,476
Math is a,

146
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:41,070
a subject where a lot of kids have a fixed
mindset, and a lot of kids struggle.

147
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,276
Teaching a growth mindset,

148
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:49,226
makes them understand, it's not a fixed
trade it's a learned set of skills.

149
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:53,006
It particularly helps kids who are
laboring under

150
00:09:53,006 --> 00:10:01,060
a negative stereotype to keep telling
themselves, I can grow my math brain.

151
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,200
Maybe my group didn't do as well
historically.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,500
We weren't encouraged.

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,980
There were stereotypes, but I can grow my
math brain.

154
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,740
Through hard work, practice and good
mentoring.

155
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,870
In a fixed mindset, students hate effort.

156
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,080
Now for me, effort is the secret of life,
but for them effort means you're dumb.

157
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,290
They think if you're good at something you
shouldn't have to work hard.

158
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,790
Well one thing we know is that math makes
you work hard.

159
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,766
So teachers and parents should keep in
mind that in a fixed mind set,

160
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,754
those students are feeling dumb,

161
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:44,540
every time they struggle, every time you
tell them they got something wrong.

162
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,844
We need to change that whole framework,
that whole mind set because when you teach

163
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:55,070
a growth mind set They begin to understand
that effort is making them smarter and

164
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,812
mistakes are important parts of learning.

165
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:06,884
So, that effort needs to be experienced as
worthwhile,

166
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:11,960
enjoyable, productive.

167
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,194
I would say to a child who's getting a lot
wrong, and

168
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:21,920
getting discouraged, stop, let's see what
is it that you don't understand?

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,292
Let's analyze it, let's see what you need
to understand.

170
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:32,810
And also many students will go, I know, I
know, I know it, when they don't.

171
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,600
And how do you break through that?

172
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,310
So you could say well I think we're having
two different conversations.

173
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,390
You think we're having a conversation
about whether you're good at this or not.

174
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,534
But we're really having a conversation
about how some kids have had

175
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:57,234
experiences and opportunities in the past
to learn this and

176
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:01,910
some kids haven't had that opportunity.

177
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,599
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.

178
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,220
So take it away from evaluating ability.

179
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:17,279
And get it into opertunities to learn.
