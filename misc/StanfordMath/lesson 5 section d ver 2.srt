1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,750
So there are many different ways of
solving that problem and

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,690
I'm gong to show you some here.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,881
Maybe you used one of them, maybe you used
a whole different one.

4
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:12,669
But as you can see form these different
problems, different solutions,

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,302
when we show these to students.

6
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:17,590
And it's very important for

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,248
the teacher to do the representing in a
number talk to make.

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,942
The Mathematics that's a very, very clear
for students.

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:31,100
But what you can do is use number talks to
help with algebraic thinking.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,524
And you can see how these properties such
as the Associative and

11
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:42,990
Distributive properties illustrated and we
can help students with those.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,952
So here are five of the different methods.

13
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:51,381
And the first one that you can see, broken
up into 15 times 10, 15 times two,

14
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:59,909
makes use of the distributive property,
and I've made a drawing for that one.

15
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,872
And then we have two methods that make use
of a doubling and halving strategy.

16
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,860
Slightly different methods with very
similar visuals.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,830
So it can be important to separate
different methods,

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,350
even if they look the same.

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,810
Because we want to capture different ways
of thinking.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,040
And then a couple more that, again, use
the distributive property.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,759
I didn't draw this one where we break up
the 15 into ten and five.

22
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,616
And this one, we break up the 12 into, 15
into 12 and 3, sorry.

23
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:35,832
Again uses the distributive property and
this is where number talks can be

24
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:41,506
really helpful, in the beginnings stages
of algebra, in having kids.

25
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:46,056
Break up the numbers, see a visual and
understand both how that's represented

26
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:53,580
correctly In mathematical notation and to
think about the distributive property.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,348
So I'm going to show you three,

28
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,270
couple more now that use the associative
property.

29
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,620
So these two methods use the associative
property.

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,609
And again it's really useful to see the
numbers written out

31
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,340
with the correct representations.

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,240
Also really nice to see these officially,
and I was going to draw those for you.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,413
I found it interesting thinking about
those, and

34
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,352
then I thought I would leave them undrawn.

35
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:21,463
So that you can think about how those
would be drawn as a kind of

36
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:25,160
interesting problem to work on I promise.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,280
So see if you can think about how those
might be drawn visually.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,690
It can also be nice with these kind of
mathematical thinking to

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,465
represent the solutions with multi link
cubes.

40
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:39,920
But those, another two solutions there are
many more.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,670
But these nicely illustrate the assosiatve
property.

42
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,464
So number talks can be done by teachers in
the whole class, as we're going to see.

43
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:52,272
Or parents can also do mini number talks
with their children just by

44
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,373
asking them the number problems.

45
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:58,334
And then challenging them to find a
different solution,

46
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,905
to work with the problem in a different
method.

47
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:05,433
Having kids solve problems in different
ways, teaches them a very,

48
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:10,710
very important building block in number
sense and mathematics.

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,132
They, it is teaching them a an ability and
willingness to break numbers apart, or

50
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:18,330
decompose them and regroup them.

51
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,009
This turns out to be a very important
foundational base,

52
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,190
from which all other mathematics builds.

53
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,500
As Sebastian talked about.

54
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,860
They also teach students something, very
important, which is math is a creative and

55
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,332
flexible subject, and this is, so
important.

56
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,919
An English mathematician,

57
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,850
Walter Sawyer ,who wrote the book A
Mathematician's Delight Once wrote, this.

58
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,918
He said, the depressing thing about
arithmetic badly taught,

59
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:51,980
is that it destroys a child's intellect,
and to some extent, his integrity.

60
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,750
Before they're taught arithmetic,

61
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,430
children will not give their assent to
utter nonsense, afterwards, they will.

62
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,260
And we certainly have a lot of evidence of
that.

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,571
We need children to understand numbers not
to blindly remember methods that they use.

64
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:14,650
But to really understand why they work and
how the methods may be used.

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,240
And number talks work really well at
different levels.

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,310
I think they're great to use in mixed
groups of students.

67
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,555
I've given that problem, eight times 15,
that exact same problem,

68
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:28,360
to elementary students, to Stanford
undergrads, to CEOs of companies.

69
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,720
And people have engaged with it with equal
interest and excitement, and

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,130
really loved seeing the different methods
and thinking about them.

71
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,980
Luke Bartlett, is the executive director
of Wolfram Alpha,

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,960
a site you probably know and love if you
are a math teacher.

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,238
And he read my book and wrote to me
saying,

74
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:52,284
you have no idea how many times I have now
asked people to calculate 18 times 5.

75
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,584
So it turns out people are really
interested in seeing all the different

76
00:04:55,584 --> 00:05:00,746
ways in which people are able to think
about these number problems.

77
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,636
And as I said, I've used them in different
settings and

78
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,606
found people to be super engaged.

79
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:08,830
And really, you just see their eyes light
up when a problem is solved in lots of

80
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,120
different ways as, as people come to
understand the creativity in numbers and

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,802
in maths.

82
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:19,401
I taught algebra to a group of pretty,
disaffected, seventh and

83
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:23,214
eight graders in the U.S., a short while
ago.

84
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,503
And I'm going to talk about it more in the
algebra session.

85
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:28,888
But we started every session with the
Numbers Talk and

86
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:31,390
they absolutely blew students' minds.

87
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,095
They had never before seen problems,

88
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:37,486
particularly bare number problems solved
in all of these different ways.

89
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:41,760
And it really changed their view of maths
and what's possible.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,112
And when we interviewed students at the
end of the program,

91
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:47,585
it was really the number talks that had
amazed them the most.

92
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:50,040
And it led to the students saying things
like this.

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,490
One of the students we interviewed said,
it's like the way,

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,450
the way our schools did it.

95
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,720
It's like very black and white.

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,240
And the way people do it here, it's like
very colorful, very bright.

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
You have very different varieties you're
looking at.

98
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,545
You can look at it one way, turn your
head, and

99
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:08,350
all of a sudden you see a whole different
picture.

100
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,160
So it really helps give them a much more
authentic view of mathematics.

101
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,414
And they're great to use in heterogeneous
groups which,

102
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:19,340
of course, all groups of students are
heterogeneous.

103
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,196
Because what we'll find is that some
people are helped just by

104
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:25,590
seeing the method and how to solve the
problem.

105
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,558
Where students who are at a higher level
are really benefit from

106
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:31,190
seeing the different solution parts.

107
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,597
Sometimes students are,

108
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:37,627
who work at a high level, only have one
way of thinking about maths.

109
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:41,332
Number talks are also the only very quick
pedagocial practice that I

110
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:45,768
know of,that teaches number fluency, and
ultimaticity.

111
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:49,510
At the same time as a conceptual
understanding of number.

112
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,644
And you may think that they're not needed
with more advanced classes,

113
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,087
such as high school classes.

114
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:00,040
clu, students taking geometry and algebra,
but at Stanford, what we've found is

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,190
that the high school students who are
given number talks are the worst.

116
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,598
The same exact problems given to younger
children,

117
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,737
they are the least able to use number
sense.

118
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:14,060
And they really struggle with even the
most basic number problems.

119
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,895
Cathy Humphrey has conducted a study in
the past year with geometry classes in

120
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:22,510
high school,regular, on track students,
not behind in any way.

121
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,890
When the students were given number
problems, they really struggled.

122
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,940
They could, they tried to use procedures
that they'd learned.

123
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,525
They were saying things like, oh I have to
carry the one or

124
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:36,730
cross out the three writing with their
fingers in the air.

125
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,710
But they were really unable to use
numbers,

126
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,995
since they were unable at first to use
numbers flexibily.

127
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,345
To break them apart and recombine them to
make them easier.

128
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:51,090
Gradually, over weeks, they began to make
sense of multipli, multiplication.

129
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,740
They began to use number sense.

130
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,340
But when their teachers gave them percent
problems to work on,

131
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,002
they fell straight back into procedural
thinking and abandoned their sense making.

132
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:06,500
So when they were asked to work out 25% of
200 They gave a range of answers.

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,985
And I want you to think about now,

134
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:11,810
what answers do you think students would
give to 25% of 200?

135
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,224
That'll help us think about this problem.

136
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:13,724
[MUSIC].
