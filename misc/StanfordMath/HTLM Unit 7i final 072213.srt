1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,706
My graduate students at Stanford and I
taught algebra to a much more

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:09,360
diverse group of kids than you just saw,
racially, socially, academically.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,956
I have great videos, I'm not able to put
them up yet,

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,580
I'm going to get new permissions.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,840
But I will take you through the teaching
approach.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,880
And our design principles.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,870
And show you how it impacted the kids.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,672
[MUSIC]
So, we taught a course which we called

9
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:28,906
Exploring Algebra and it was offered as a
five week summer school to seventh and

10
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:33,440
eighth grade kids, who were what I would
describe as disaffected.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,256
They were typically diverse Bay Area group
of kids.

12
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:43,310
This is a chart of their ethnicities.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,440
So summer school math is taught in the
long summers that they have in the US.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,832
Usually most of the kids have been made to
come by parents or by schools who may

15
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:55,645
require a summer school class to go on
with the curriculum at the school.

16
00:00:55,645 --> 00:01:00,265
So our kids came from 33 different classes
in their middle schools.

17
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:03,505
90% of them had been made to go to the
class and

18
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:09,590
their prior achievement in the last math
class was very mixed.

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,150
So 40% of them had got an A or a B, 20% a
C and 40% a D or an F.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,155
So that was a pretty heterogeneous group
which we were happy about as we wanted

21
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,288
that to be part of our teaching.

22
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:26,310
So with 40% of them getting As and Bs, you
may wonder why I call them disaffected.

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,824
That's because in the survey that we gave
out on the first day of class where, where

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:37,180
students told us that they've been made to
come, there were typical descriptions.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:44,427
We asked them how they felt about math and
these were pretty typical.

26
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:45,623
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:51,419
So we taught four classes of about 30 kids
in each and my co-teachers were

28
00:01:51,419 --> 00:02:00,340
Emily Sheehan, Tesha [UNKNOWN] Irving,
Nick Fiori and Jennifer DiBrienza.

29
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,500
And we had four teaching principles.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,340
To engage students as active inquirers and
capable learners.

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,838
To teach algebra through mathematical
practices, generalizing, reasoning,

32
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,610
organizing, representing.

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,697
To develop a collaborate mathematical
community and to give opportunities for

34
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:17,260
student voice.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,100
There were four 90 minute sessions a week
over five weeks.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,458
So our main task that we gave were algebra
generalization tasks, and

37
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm going to give you links and places in
the resources where you can lots of those.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,860
They both engaged students actively on the
first point, and

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,125
they got straight to the core of algebra,
relationships and generalization.

40
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,910
And they encourage mathematical practices.

41
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,340
The students were really excited to learn
algebra in this way and

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,550
to see it as a tool that helped them.

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,931
So this statement about teaching students
as capable learners we had no ability to

44
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:54,406
repeat and we wanted them all to work on
hard problems.

45
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,965
And to give them messages that we believed
in them.

46
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:01,176
So we typically gave problems that had a,
had a low entry bar.

47
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:05,760
Everybody could start on it but extend it
to high places.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,180
A good example of this is the pattern
growth task, where we saw the work of

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,940
the three boys in the fourth class when we
talked about tasks.

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,040
Anyone can describe a pattern in engaging
the task.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,630
But that one extended to quadratic
functions.

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,660
The border problem that you've just seen
also has a low entry and a high ceiling.

53
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,100
So does the painted q problem we're
going to look at in a minute.

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,068
So the students all told us that their
previous math experience had

55
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:34,463
meant working silently through workshop
worksheets.

56
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:38,280
And we encourage them to discuss
everything, to work in pairs or groups.

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,256
Sometimes we strategically group students,

58
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:43,019
sometimes we let them choose where they
worked.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,600
So we wanted to have whole class
discussions and

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,584
that meant students need to become
comfortable presenting from the front.

61
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:55,720
W hich is pretty scary for middle school
kids if they haven't done it before.

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,798
So we set out to nurture that by giving
them very easy ways to come up to

63
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,815
the front at first.

64
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:04,295
For example earlier on we gave them the
four fours activity which is one I

65
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:07,330
like a lot so I'll give you this now.

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,990
Can you make every number between one and
twenty using only four fours?

67
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,635
And you can use any operation.

68
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,090
For example we might say this.
