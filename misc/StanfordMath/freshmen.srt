1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,241
Like subconsciously sort of thought of
being good at math like either you were or

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:05,689
you weren't and then coming to this class
I've recognized oh,

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,137
okay, that's kind of the mindset I've been
in my whole life and

4
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:10,921
I feel like that's the environment that
I've been in for like 18 years,

5
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:17,585
this class really allowed me to see that
that's really not how it is, and that.

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm like working now to try ove towards a
growth mindset, so

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,565
that is sort of the big thing that I took
away.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,853
>> My take away was mostly, because at the
beginning of the course I talked about and

9
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,605
like wrote a lot about how I hated math
and had, like,

10
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:34,957
absolutely terrible experiences and like I
don't take that back now, I like still

11
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:43,600
did, but I sort of have reframed them in
the sense of like that wasn't me, uh...

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,077
Being bad at math.

13
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:49,389
It was more in maybe the practices that I
encountered or

14
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,735
sort of getting stuck in a rut early on
and

15
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:59,411
having that dictate the rest of the course
of my mathematics education unfortunately.

16
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,839
But it's a new leaf so.

17
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:01,339
>> Great.

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,190
And said, now math.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,760
And I can in with this fixed mindset just
like math itself,

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,440
you know, made me scared, confused.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,150
And I was kind of in denial.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,270
And even during our first few classes,
when we had to do math equations as

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,540
a class, the first time we did that I was
really, really, really scared.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,243
And then these are my footprints through
the, this class, and

25
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:27,476
I feel like this is me after, and so
whenever someone mentions math now I'm

26
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:30,921
actually interested in what they're
talking about and what they have to say or

27
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,419
what they're going to say about math and I
feel like this class has made me want to

28
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:40,590
give math definitely a second chance, and
so...

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,071
I'm not dreading the math class that I
have to take at Stanford as much as

30
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,180
I I was before.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,906
And I feel like I'm definitely leaving
this classroom with a growth mindset not

32
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:53,585
only towards math, but towards all other
subjects.

33
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,721
>> So when now when I meet difficulties I
don't feel like it's just the fact that I

34
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:59,465
don't have the talent, it's just that I
really have to persevere and

35
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:02,256
give it another shot.

36
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:06,460
>> Just reading about it maybe I wanted to
have a rough mindset.

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,367
That like seems like something I should
have, like I should work for,

38
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,815
so like learning that it was stronger in
like women and

39
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:16,075
minorities, which is like I'm both of
those, so like...

40
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:19,096
I realize like, I have to like, really
like, work at it to give it like,

41
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:21,420
to have the girls mindset.

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,748
And Just like, telling myself things like,
like not to blame myself that,

43
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:27,816
you know like, it's not like, It's not
something that's internal like,

44
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:31,800
something about me that like, makes me
struggle.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,186
It's helps me to cope with
>> Difficulties a lot better.

46
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:40,055
>> So I guess I kind of did like a graph
of the different concepts and

47
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:43,105
how they related with me.

48
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:47,263
So like the bottom was my interest in
these different topics, and

49
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:51,550
I struggled with coming up with this
title.

50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,825
I settled with mind blown [LAUGH] ...

51
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:57,710
Because I guess coming in like, for

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,261
me really realizing that I had like, a
really strongly fixed mindset.

53
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:06,113
And like, through this course like, being
able to like,

54
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:11,320
evaluate my past experiences and stuff,
that I'm still doing now.

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,010
It like, did a tremendous amount for me.

56
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,528
Especially like, this quarter
particularly.

57
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:20,859
>> And other things like which I race and
gender and stuff that I was like very

58
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:27,126
interested in and it like offered me a
whole new way to think about it.

59
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:30,090
>> Even if we're stuck, the opportunity to
see where you're stuck at and

60
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,522
what's preventing you from moving on is,
is better than just being stuck and not

61
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:39,205
knowing because then you can take a step
back and go okay, what's preventing...

62
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:42,065
And to me like, I'm taking a Math 19
course at Stanford and when I

63
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:45,640
first went in, I was like okay, well, I
was scared like Jackie from calculus and

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,070
I was like, I'm not sure if I'm ready for
this.

65
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,175
But taking a step back, even when I don't
understand what the professor is trying to

66
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:54,885
give, like teach us, I'm taking a step
back and

67
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:58,710
realizing that maybe it's not me who
doesn't Understand.

68
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,455
>> Maybe it's the way she's presenting
information and I

69
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:05,542
just need to take a step back and realize
that even if I'm stuck in this spider web,

70
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:09,263
because I know that I'm stuck and because
I know it's making me stuck I have

71
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:17,048
the ability to go and make myself unstuck
by say, by going to like TA session.

72
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,403
>> Alright guys, so this our, kind of
like, concept map in a way, so

73
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:23,610
we kind of
>> want to switch places with me?

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,519
>> Sure.
[LAUGH] So

75
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,667
we basically grouped it around that
there's a bunch of spider webs amongst our

76
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,937
midst and our mind and that's keeping us
from reaching our true potential and

77
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:36,902
with this class, it was kind of like Raid
in that It melted away these kind of

78
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,562
thoughts that we had to show that we can
really achieve not anything,

79
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:47,710
well probably anything, but a lot of
things.

80
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,448
[LAUGH] So it's kind of like fixed risk
growth.

81
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:54,051
How standardized testing effects your
learning.

82
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,990
Traditional learning and whether we have
bad teachers and mathematicians.

83
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,799
So, these are the spiders who are spinning
the webs around us
