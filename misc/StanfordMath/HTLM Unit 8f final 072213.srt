1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,670
Some people argue that open inquiry
approaches are only for

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,140
high achieving students or students from
more wealthy homes.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,896
The most of the Phoenix Park students
lived on a housing estate,

4
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:16,230
I think like a project in the US, that the
police wouldn't go onto at night.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,380
And they came to the school mathematically
weak and

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,710
significantly below the national average
in their maths achievement.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,490
They left the school significantly above
the national average.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,592
The students at Phoenix Park, even though
they learned through open problems,

9
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:31,788
still learned standard mathematical
methods, but they may/g, they learned them

10
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:36,620
through an inquiring relationship, which
meant they learned how to use them.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,680
And this stayed with them into their work
lives.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,648
When I caught up with both sets of
students as young adults about 24,

13
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:46,040
I found that the [UNKNOWN] students were
in more professional jobs that were

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,524
higher on the social class scale,

15
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:53,700
even though they were living in a much
poorer area of the country.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,454
Their inquiry relationship had clearly
stayed with them and

17
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,282
insured their success.

18
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:01,055
The interviews of both sets of the
[UNKNOWN] were very interesting and

19
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,120
they were in the paper.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,050
Called psychological prisons, in the
reference section.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,550
But here's one of the young adults
speaking in a way that's pretty typical.

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,787
I ask, what happens if you don't know how
to do something with maths in work?

23
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:17,780
And she said, keep on going until I do.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,270
Because I wouldn't, if something is, if I
can't do it, then it annoys me.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,360
I need to see something through really
until the end.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,365
So I need to understand how I've done it.

27
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,997
If I don't immediately understand it,

28
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:32,210
then I will keep on going at it until I do
understand it.

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,505
The other school students I've seen
develop this sort of relationship were in

30
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:41,160
the INP program IMP is a high school
curriculum and

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,250
the only one that I would describe as
inquiry based in the US.

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,652
It's won awards, and was sponsored by the
National Science Foundation, but

33
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,352
has largely been eliminated because people
campaigned for

34
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:56,540
it to be replaced by procedural
approaches.

35
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,063
Some schools and some states still use it.

36
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,950
And lots of them use it with great results
and

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,020
the graduates from that program are very
interesting.

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,660
Like and like you know, there similar to
the Phoenix [INAUDIBLE] students.

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,380
Chris software engineer at Udacity, who
you've already heard from.

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,565
Told me, one of my very first meetings
with him, that the only reason he could do

41
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,700
his job now, was because of the way he'd
learned maths through IMP.

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,185
And this is Chris talking about that.

43
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,411
>> I managed to spend my seventh eighth,
ninth and

44
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,379
tenth grades through middle school and
first half of high school in

45
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,764
a math program called, The Interactive
Math Program,

46
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:36,410
which was developed by a guy here I think
in the Bay area.

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,280
That, and it was inquiry based math which
I didn't know anything about at the time.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,360
We talked back then a lot about deep
learning and

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,324
shallow learning and it's pretty
controversial you know a lot of

50
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:52,570
parents you know yanked their kids out of
the program because it was so weird.

51
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,050
I loved it and it was just based on
problems.

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,330
You know we had problems of the day, and

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,570
problems of the week that all you know
culmanated into the problem of the unit.

54
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,690
And they presented, you know, these
problems, you know, like, that we have to,

55
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,540
you know, try and solve, and we'd have no
idea how to solve them.

56
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,530
And two months later,

57
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,068
all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we had
all the tools we needed to solve them.

58
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,806
And that turns out to be exactly what I do
from day to day.

59
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,238
Which is and learning the skills, and
having the courage to just sit down and

60
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:24,586
try to figure out how to solve something.

61
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:29,752
And then after that learn the vernacular
that is incorporated you know,

62
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,560
into that, you know.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,950
Though, I was pretty lucky I think to have
that guidance early on.

64
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,200
And that certainly set you know, built the
framework for

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,045
which I pretty much, accomplish things in
life.

66
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:43,890
>> Mm-hm.

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,962
>> When I follow students through IMP
classes,

68
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,550
I saw the inquiry relationship develop.

69
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,350
They also did well on standard tests.

70
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,822
One of the boys I asked in an interview
what he thought about math said this,

71
00:03:54,822 --> 00:04:00,149
"Math is really beautiful, and it has
these patterns in it that are amazing".

72
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,445
Most art is just made of up patterns
anyway, and so

73
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:06,305
I've written a lot of poems about it and a
lot of songs.

74
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,451
You can tell it's Californian.

75
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:09,415
Involving it.

76
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,431
Polyrhythms is one thing that kind of
interspersed music and math for

77
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,135
me, because it's like patterns that take
multiple measures to

78
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:19,620
repeat because they don't fit evenly over
four bars.

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,770
And it's exactly like a fraction because
if you take a fraction high enough,

80
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,530
there's going to be common denominators.

81
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,400
And so seeing how patterns can be
interesting and artistic.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,030
And math intersperses a lot for me that
way.

83
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,430
When I've shared that quote with people
and

84
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,645
they said, wow, that is such an unusual
view of maths.

85
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:43,810
But actually, it sounds very similar to
mathematicians talking about maths.

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,700
And there's a very simple reason for that.

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,576
It's because Toby had a school approach
where he was working like a mathematician

88
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:53,281
rather than the usual approach which is
unlike the maths of mathematicians or

89
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:56,180
the maths of the world.

90
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,290
So, teachers can build that relationship
with their students.

91
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,090
So can parents as we'll hear in a minute
and they'll be sure to

92
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,898
build that relationship from kindergarten
up, by asking students to be curious,

93
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:11,858
to take risks, to turn, to learn math
through problem solving.

94
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:17,380
So the maths we want in classrooms is
really multi dimensional.

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,864
Uni dimensional mass is mass that has 1
dimension often its

96
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:25,610
reproducing matter that the teacher's
shown here.

97
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,460
Multi dimensional math is about teaching
the maths the mathematician work with and

98
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,330
all of its dimensions.

99
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,790
So it might include asking questions.

100
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,026
A really important part of a
mathematician's work is coming up

101
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,040
with a good question.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,310
Connecting methods and ideas using logic
and reasoning.

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,140
Using, adapting and applying procedures.

104
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,225
Using intuition, making sense of
situtations.

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,861
I've written something for

106
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:54,670
people in this course, that I've been
meaning to write for a long time.

107
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,670
Which is really a summary of what I've
told you explained about maths teaching.

108
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,184
As a one page document that you can
download and keep it, it's helpful.

109
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:06,205
It's sort of what I think needs to be
happening with students in maths

110
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:09,968
classrooms, and it comes from research and
experience, and I thought something very

111
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:15,700
brief might be helpful for you to use with
parents, administrators, and others.

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,298
Parents have a very important role in
building this relationship too, and

113
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,748
I want to introduce you now to another
high level math tutor,

114
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:28,392
that we haven't met before, and she is
super interesting.

115
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,080
For parents, teachers, anyone.

116
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,029
So, her name is Sarah Flannery.

117
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:36,439
And at the age of 16, she won the Young
Scientist of the Year Award in Ireland,

118
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,980
for a new idea she developed in
mathematics and cryptography.

119
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,730
She has a great autobiography in which she
talks about how she came to develop.

120
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,630
What I see is a perfect mathematical
inquiry relationship.

121
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,910
And she got that from her parents.

122
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,468
Her book's called "In Code".

123
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,418
In it, she says that working on math
puzzles with her family did more for

124
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:00,360
her than all the years of math classes in
school put together.

125
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,090
So here's Sarah talking about math.

126
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,990
>> My parents definitely let me see that
mathematics was this beautiful subject.

127
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,929
I think a lot of people never even hear
those two words in the same sentence.

128
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:14,436
>> Mm-hm.
>> So

129
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,955
they gave that to me, and they gave me,

130
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:20,580
through these different puzzles where even
I thought I couldn't start out on them.

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,880
They showed me, no, you have lots of tools
and techniques and

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,340
ways to visualize and get started.

133
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,192
And you can do it and, and then they
talked a lot about

134
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:32,190
the mathematicians themselves and their
lives,.

135
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,540
We did a lot puzzles at home.

136
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,364
We had a blackboard in the kitchen and,

137
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:40,069
you know, when I talked to my dad about
those times he said, that we hound him for

138
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:47,110
puzzles and my dad says that he collects
puzzles like someone might collect jokes.

139
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,014
You know, and when I read your book and

140
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,926
I see you talking about the benefits of
doing long problems, or

141
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:55,454
of working in groups, or of understanding
when it's important to, you know,

142
00:07:55,454 --> 00:08:01,868
to estimate, to visualize, understand the
problem that you're working on.

143
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:05,516
You get all of that from puzzles, or the
absolute range and

144
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:12,040
variety of the puzzles that my dad managed
to dig up and find for us.

145
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,659
>> What sort of puzzles did you work on as
a child?

146
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:19,060
>> Well, I mean we worked on all sorts of
things.

147
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,920
Some that you could just work out in your
head by thinking.

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,393
And there's the two jar puzzle where you
have you know, two jars of

149
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:30,582
different sizes and then you try to get an
amount of water that is a size,

150
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:36,300
that is not one of the jars you've been
given.

151
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,540
You know, and there's typical examples
where you've a jar of size 3,

152
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,212
and a jar of size 5, and you have to get a
size 4.

153
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:44,446
But that's the kind of puzzle that can be
extended, and once you've solved it for

154
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,250
one and you like it.

155
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,276
And anybody can do it.

156
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,420
>> Mm-hm.
>> And you can do it in different ways.

157
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,605
You can think of it in your head, you can
really, actually, physically do it, or

158
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:56,033
you can you know, write out cases, and so
on.

159
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,796
And you know, my dad would give us these
puzzles, and

160
00:08:57,796 --> 00:09:01,080
pick a number that, you know, pick one
that wasn't easy, you know.

161
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,090
So if you have a 3 gallon and a 5 gallon,
it's easy to get 2.

162
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,442
But you know, what you do to make, to make
it all the way to 4,

163
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:11,850
and then he might ask us, well, what other
measurements can you make out of that.

164
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,402
And then he would know that, you know, if
you picked relative primes or

165
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,866
something, you took 5 and 8, then you
could have the puzzle again and

166
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,125
you could do the same exploration over
again.

167
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,245
You know, other puzzles are like, I won't,
I won't go into them all, but

168
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:27,165
say, say there's a rabbit, there's a
puzzle about a rabbit.

169
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,921
Where you have to figure out how long it
takes them to fall out of

170
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:35,300
a hole given a certain you know, it crawls
up 3 steps everyday but falls back 2.

171
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,244
And so you have to figure out how many
days does it take to get out of

172
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,598
a 30 foot well.

173
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:39,430
For example and

174
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,398
that's a puzzle where I don't want to ruin
it but if you think about it you, it

175
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:49,910
teaches you to not rush ahead too quickly
once you think you've got something.

176
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,772
So make sure, it [UNKNOWN] you to remember
the real world even if

177
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,742
you think you've got a procedure or and
it's funny like that one is,

178
00:09:55,742 --> 00:10:00,952
you know, 3 minus 2 is not always equal to
1 or whatever you, it's.

179
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,006
>> Yeah.

180
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,516
>> Then other ones were things about magic
squares and so

181
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:10,600
on, where again, my dad would just give a
puzzle.

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,268
And it was about numbers and manipulating
numbers, so you could get a,

183
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,250
you know, get a grasp on it.

184
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,800
>> Mm-hm.

185
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,277
But then, he could extend it into
something where it was teaching you

186
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:24,040
about rotations, and transformations, and
generalize the problem.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,176
And just make you feel like you were
starting to understand what it might be to

188
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,577
do a proof, what it might be to, you know,
to just see more and

189
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:33,160
more of the subject that is mathematics.

190
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,792
And then he would, you know, put in an
interesting fact about, well,

191
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:40,400
there's magic squares, and such and such a
square in Germany, or it's in this.

192
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,020
You know painting by Brecht is it, or I'm
forgetting that stuff.

193
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,412
[LAUGH] But I'm struck by it even when I
talk to my dad's you know,

194
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:53,380
back on those lovely memories I do have of
doing puzzles as a child you know.

195
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,796
Another thing my parents also did which is
not related directly to mathematics but

196
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,652
that you also get through puzzles,

197
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:05,097
is they tried to make sure that we could
express ourselves well.

198
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:05,630
>> Mm-hm.

199
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,090
>> [LAUGH] It's a service now by saying
that but,

200
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,460
you know, if you can express yourself
well.

201
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,832
>> huh.
>> Then that's part of

202
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:15,442
not only learning how to ask good
questions but in,

203
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,862
in figuring out a way of, you know,
organizing your thoughts.

204
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:20,721
>> Right, right.

205
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,425
>> Being systematic, but then.

206
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,081
>> You know, it's in a really important
thing,

207
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:27,071
which is not just about mathematics, but
that you can get through puzzles, and

208
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:29,371
something that will, see, you know, see
you in good stead for

209
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,525
the rest of your life, you know.

210
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,739
>> So I'd like you to write briefly, what
surprised you about Sarah's reflections.
