1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,460
In the reference section, I've included a
list of some great puzzle books.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,410
There's something slightly separate as we
talk about parent help.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,910
I've developed uh,a written article about
how to help with Maths homework.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,810
I wrote it for UK parents, but the
messages and advice apply to all parents.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,240
And there's a link to that in the
reference section.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,347
I've played you lots of videos of

7
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:25,980
Sebastian [INAUDIBLE] talking about Maths
already as I think is very insightful.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,967
And now I have one last one to play you.

9
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,809
At then end of the interview with
Sebastian I asked him, what advice he

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,960
would give K12 teachers preparing
students, and this is what he said.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,062
Someone told me once that, if you are K
through 12 teacher and

12
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,964
you're teacking kids in Maths.

13
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:46,804
Something like 65% of the jobs that your
kids will take haven't even been

14
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,860
invented yet.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,710
So it's really hard to prepare kids.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,650
And obviously we live within an utterly
outdated curriculum.

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,560
The curriculum goes back to any number of
years.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,078
And for various bureaucratic reasons,

19
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:02,620
we are just unable to change even the most
basic things.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,670
And we also try to force every student
into the same schemes if they're all

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,866
like robots and have to learn at the same
speed.

22
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,039
Which is, specifically for

23
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,600
Maths, is really a problem because Maths
is such beautiful thing.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,436
If you give people the time that they
need, some are very fast,

25
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:16,660
some are very slow.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,522
You can get pretty much every kid there.

27
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:19,472
>> Mm-hm.
>> For me the,

28
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,008
the critical thing in Maths [INAUDIBLE]
not applying formulas, like the most, or

29
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,870
least interesting component.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,222
The most interesting thing is, think like
a mathematician.

31
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,164
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:32,440
>> And think like a mathematician is a
very intuitive thing.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,920
It's the skill that you can look at a
problem, and

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,105
make assessment when a number's involved,
when a quantity's involved.

35
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,140
It's the skill of making a baking recipe,

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,560
understand how to scale it up to more
people.

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,410
It's the skill, how to pack a truck.

38
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,850
When you want to move somewhere, and how
the moving distance affects the,

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,360
the size of truck you're going to rent and
the way you pack it, turns out.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,750
If you move short distance, you pack it
different if you move long distances.

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,462
And these skills in daily life, really,
really good mathematicians to me

42
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:05,016
have really insightful answers for those
skills.

43
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:08,041
It's the skill of thinking first
principles.

44
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,660
Most of us think by analogy as Elon Musk
tends to say.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,339
But if you say, okay, the problem is
solved this way over here has to be

46
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,957
solved exactly the same way over here.

47
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,630
With a understanding that there's
assumptions behind it.

48
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,780
It's a skill of being able to say, well,
does it have to be this way?

49
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,280
What are the assumptions?

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,318
In my own work right now in education we
make this assumption that we

51
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,280
teach all of the students at the same
speed.

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,650
And it has a huge impact on, on, on, on
learning.

53
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,100
What if you just let that go instead and
you can teach students at their own speed.

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,395
What if, what would be the outcome, and
how could we,

55
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,800
structure the material differently.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,396
It's the skill of logical thinking of
saying,

57
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,820
okay if that's the case,maybe the
following assumptions are also wrong.

58
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,290
Maybe the teacher doesn't have to be in
the entertaining the kids.

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,710
Maybe the teacher can be interacting with
the kids on their own turf, and

60
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,375
then really be relentless about digging in
and seeing if he can find a better mode.

61
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,819
Again, I think what we teach in Maths is
pretty irrelevant.

62
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,310
It's the skills that kids pick up, how to
look at life, and

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,230
the ability to apply those things to real
life situations.

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,610
I think any particular formula is probably
uninteresting but

65
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,312
the ability to think abstractly.

66
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:15,852
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

67
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:20,110
Matha to me is just a training course to
be a citizen, how to think in the world.

68
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,765
And were the numbers of people, of
relationships, of time, of space and

69
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,498
so on.

70
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:27,487
So we can get people that kids that
feeling of how to deal with these things

71
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,900
and empower them and take away the fear
everywhere.

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,695
And that's irrespective of the job
description, again no job has,

73
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:40,105
most jobs have not been invented yet that
teachers teach kids on.

74
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:42,789
>> You also asked Sarah Flannery a similar
question and

75
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,885
this is some of Sarah's reflections.

76
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,669
>> Some of the things that I use in my
work all the time and

77
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,195
I don't know how to answer this question
well but,

78
00:03:53,195 --> 00:04:01,860
it's to prepare people for the basic tasks
of making sense of data.

79
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,530
Understanding how to visualize data in
different ways.

80
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,804
Being able to estimate I think people
don't don't understand how to do

81
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:15,349
that enough and being confident about
looking at things in different ways.

82
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,113
And cross checking their work and

83
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:22,708
you know not being afraid to use intuition
to move forward and get something done.

84
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,921
But then, you know, taking a step back and
being realistic and

85
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,568
checking your work [LAUGH].

86
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,466
And as I said, I think another way to
prepare people, is,

87
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:37,490
communication speak skills and the ability
to express themselves and their ideas.

88
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,936
Because if you look at employers, every
job in any field is asking for

89
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:47,630
good communication skills and good
problem-solving skills.

90
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,382
And so, to that end, you know, do puzzles,
because you get all of that out of it, and

91
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,594
you get confidence.

92
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,672
>> So thinking about what both Sebastian
and Sarah said, what do you

93
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:02,087
think are the implications of their ideas
for teaching if we were to take them on?
