00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,560
And welcome to our Fireside chat.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,130
As you'll see, we have a lovely warm,
toasty fire here, and Holly and

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,550
I are going to sit and get nice and cozy.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,410
And, first of all I want to introduce you
to Holly.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,840
This is Holly Pope, she's a graduate
student at Stanford doing a PhD with me.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,780
And Holly was match coach in Pittsburgh
before she came to Stanford.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,560
So just a few words about the course
before we start going through

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,880
some questions.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,980
I wanted to say first of all

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,900
that this course has really been an
amazing experience for me.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,990
So many people have told me of ways it's
helped them, it's been really great.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,050
The questions you sent in for this
fireside chat just showed me

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,520
How much we're together in our mission and
knowledge and values.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,340
Those are really the questions I would
expect to be asked.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,310
Probably, the ones I would have written if
I were you.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,270
So as well as people telling me how
helpful the course has been,

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,050
I've been super impressed with the act,
the submissions people have sent in for

19
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,870
the tasks and activities in the course.

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,420
So really big congratulations to you guys,

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,260
we've achieved the first nuke in math's
teaching and learning.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,900
So that's great.

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,200
So, a couple of things just for info for
you,

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,580
we have about 40,000 people registered for
the course, which is long-going and

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,670
about 300 questions were sent in for this
fireside chat so

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,460
we're not going to answer all of those,
you'll be pleased to know.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,400
We've looked at the ones that were most
voted on that seemed to be most,

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,600
wanting to be asked.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,605
So I'm going to hand over to Holly now and
we're going to

30
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:36,885
>> Chat through some of the questions.

31
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,845
>> So thanks for having me here, Jill.

32
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,405
>> It's a pleasure.

33
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:45,840
>> The first question that I want to ask
you comes, is what comes next?

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,150
A lot of people wanted to know what comes
next after this,

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,880
how do I bring this home with, what are
some things that I could do?

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,376
To get materials and so on.

37
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,200
>> Yeah, sure.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,380
So I think the first thing to talk about
is the student course which

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,268
is the course I have been talking about
through this course.

40
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:05,150
>> Uh-huh.

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,830
>> And, what I've been thinking about that
was this.

42
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,900
This course, the course for teachers and
parents was a huge amount of work,

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,630
preparing it, teaching it, managing it
much more than I thought it would be.

44
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,320
I think I worked through about twelve
weekends straight in

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,270
the run-up to the course.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,430
My kids were complaining, but anyway.

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,950
So one thing I want to do, and

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,870
think about the student course is plan, is
not move at quite such a fast pace.

49
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,430
So it's very carefully planned, and it's
really a good experience for the student.

50
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,270
So I want it to be very good and I manner
the time it takes for that.

51
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,140
So the co, the student course will be
sometime next year next academic year.

52
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,540
So the other thing I've been thinking
about the student course is ideally,

53
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,638
if I were the teacher giving the students
intervention to help them change in

54
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,657
the views about themselves and about
maths.

55
00:02:56,657 --> 00:03:01,050
Then I think this summer or right at the
beginning of the school year is probably

56
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,742
the best time for that ideally, or maybe
the end of the previous school year.

57
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,500
>> Yeah.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,460
>> So I'm thinking what I would like to do
with the course is have it available for

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,220
this school year but late in the school
year maybe spring and

60
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,170
then keep it going through the summer and
into the fall.

61
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,390
So that people can choose to have students
take it this summer or

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,240
the fall of maybe spring of this year.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,647
So people also asked how the, how,

64
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:30,320
how they can register students, when
they'll, when they'll know it's ready.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,160
So we'll send an email out to everybody in
this course when the student course is

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,538
getting ready and is ready.

67
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,910
>> Yeah.

68
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,710
>> So the other thing I'd like to mention
is, I would

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,080
really like to do research around the
course and find out if it's helpful for

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,885
the students who do this course which
would be a short intervention for them.

71
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:51,630
>> Yeah.

72
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,980
>> And so, what I wanted to ask is, if
there are any teachers or

73
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,768
districts that would work with me on that
research it would be really good to know.

74
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,288
>> Mm-hm.

75
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:04,040
>> So maybe I could work with whole
districts where some of

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,170
the kids take the course.

77
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,560
And there's an e-mail which I also sent
out for people to write reflections on

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:18,712
the course, which is jo, jomathscourse
sorry, jomathscourse@gmail.com.

79
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:23,970
>> That's jomathscourse@gmail.com.

80
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,200
So maybe if you could send an email to
that, if you are somebody that

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,065
would like to help with the research, with
a student course, that'd be great.

82
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,130
>> That's a good idea.

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,860
Very good idea.

84
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,280
>> So resources for problems in inquiry
based activities.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,480
A lot of people wanted.

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,220
>> Yeah the, the resources.

87
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,370
So I've, there are a number of things.

88
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,715
I guess a number of people asked, can you
send us more inquiry based activities.

89
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,160
>> Mm-hm.
>> Project based work.

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,010
Are there good curriculum out there?

91
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,450
Are there more examples of number talks?

92
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,990
Some people asked whether I could send the
lesson plans that we used in our summer

93
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,430
school teaching that I talked about in the
course and the materials and the syllabus.

94
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,040
So loads of things.

95
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,730
And other people ask whether we could give
more a confirmative assessment,

96
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,940
which is very important.

97
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,850
And so many many things that would be
helpful for teachers.

98
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,974
And so what I'm doing now is I'm working
on a new website which is called Youcubed.

99
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:30,580
>> That's exciting.

100
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,640
>> Yeah youcubed.org and it's not up right
now but it will be by the end of September

101
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,356
and on that website we're going to put
lots of helpful things for teachers.

102
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:39,940
>> Oh, that's good.
>> So

103
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,742
lots of activities and some of the videos
from the course I think too.

104
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:49,610
>> So people asked whether there was going
to be a how to do this course and

105
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,080
I did say this in, in the course we just
had that.

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,610
It was really just about sparking ideas,
and

107
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,220
it left open the whole question of how do
you teach in these ways,

108
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,350
what are the detailed things you have to
do in classrooms.

109
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,880
So, I think that would be a great follow
on course, and I'm thinking about that.

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,850
So, and I think as well this course will
run again.

111
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,040
>> but I'm not sure at this point whether
it's going to be free again or

112
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,486
whether there will be a small cost, stand
for discussions.

113
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:21,320
But the other thing I wanted to mention
was a number of schools and

114
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,810
teachers have told me that they've
downloaded some of the videos and

115
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,703
they've used them either with kids or with
parents.

116
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,630
So some schools in the US have been using
them at back to school nights.

117
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,660
>> Oh, that's a good idea.

118
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,200
>> Yeah.

119
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,500
>> Yeah.

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,400
And you can do that.

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,820
All the videos are downloadable.

122
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,120
So, people have asked me if it's okay to
download them and

123
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,280
what I've said is, it's okay with me to
use them in schools and

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,130
with parents and other but not to put on
websites.

125
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,072
I don't really want them to be posted up
on websites.

126
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:54,400
>> Right, right.
>> Really so those are the you know,

127
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,556
the students course, the follow up course.

128
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:58,307
>> Mm-hm.

129
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:03,130
>> And the youcubed site which is going to
be a site where we can put up a lot

130
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,489
resources to, for people to keep working
these ways.

131
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:13,290
>> And there is also the Wiki from the
class Wiki that has some resources on it

132
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,448
that people can refer to.

133
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,020
>>That's right, you reminded me of that.

134
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,830
So we have got a lot, this, under,

135
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,080
under the Wiki there is a tab called Great
Tasks or something like that, Good Tasks.

136
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,460
So under that is a lot of references to
tasks,

137
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,696
to books full of tasks, So other good
websites and apps and

138
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,820
all sorts of things so yeah, I'm glad you
mentioned that.

139
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,754
That, that's already on the site and under
the Wiki.

140
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,790
>> Yeah, yeah.

141
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,970
>> So, the next burning question [LAUGH]

142
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,201
no pun intended was about teaching
untracked groups.

143
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,370
>> Huh
>> Or sets.

144
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,238
And, and set groups

145
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,845
>> Huh
>> As people refer to.

146
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,610
>> them in England.

147
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,324
Do you have any, suggestions on
implementing those ideas?

148
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:03,080
>> Yeah, so, I mean I think a lot of
people asked kind of how to questions.

149
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,440
Partly to ask if they could be in the
follow up class,

150
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,700
like "How do you teach un-tracked groups"
and we can't in this session just

151
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,990
explain all these complex Things that
teachers need to be doing.

152
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,604
But I wanted to say a couple of things
about the question of un-tracked groups.

153
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,530
And, so I gave,

154
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,080
I showed the evidence in the class about
the success of heterogeneous classes and

155
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,532
groups, and I've worked with a lot of
schools that have un-tracked.

156
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:33,630
And What, what I know from that is it,

157
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,890
the work of teaching in [UNKNOWN] groups
is not, it's not eas,

158
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,836
it's not an easy shift you can't just
untrack and teach in the same way.

159
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:40,754
>> Right, right.

160
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,260
>> So teachers do need time and

161
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,770
training to Know the methods for teaching
an on-track classes.

162
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,930
And that training takes time, I mean I
work closely at the moment with the school

163
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,930
district Vista, school district Vista
Unified, school district in San Diego.

164
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,930
And there's a director of mathematics
there, and she and

165
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,040
I have been working with the teachers over
quite a few sessions every year to

166
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,520
help them learn to teach in un-track
groups.

167
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,490
They wanted to un-track, which is great.

168
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,770
And, we've been teaching them.

169
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,280
So, one of the very useful strategies, and
something people can look at is,

170
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,270
complex instruction, that's a pedagogical
strategy for having group work be equal.

171
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,340
Some of the schools I've worked with that
have been very successful have

172
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,520
used complex instruction.

173
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,830
There are complex instruction books that
can be bought, and some of

174
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,488
my articles have a lot more detail about
how to teach through complex instruction.

175
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,794
>>That's good.

176
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,310
>>Another thing I was going to say is

177
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,860
There's different ways of teaching
un-tracked groups.

178
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,780
And it's important that kids, can go to
different places, mathematically,

179
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,610
and be pushed in different ways, it's not
that you un-track and

180
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,700
then everybody gets the same experience,
really.

181
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,480
And I've seen schools work in different
ways,

182
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,074
the [INAUDIBLE] instruction school I
started, which I called Railside Mm hmm.

183
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:12,370
>> Have students working with a math task
and they all stay together in

184
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,240
fact nobody moved on to the next one and
so it finished but

185
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,620
they really push students pretty much
forward as they worked on activities.

186
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,500
They were kind of,

187
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,749
the tasks themselves were more open than
your sort of standard math questions.

188
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:27,303
>> Mm hmm.
>> And.

189
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,070
Kids who came in, sort of, at a higher
level and maybe being faster, whatever.

190
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,970
What they found was often those kids were
very narrow,

191
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,242
like they could be fast,

192
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:40,190
>> yeah,
>> but they were fast on procedures and

193
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,440
when they were pushed to maybe explain
some thing or

194
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,170
help others understand or represent in
different ways they found that hard so

195
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,350
They all stayed on the same task, but kids
were pushed in different ways.

196
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,250
So everybody was challenged all the time.

197
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,480
Without going up higher though.

198
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,310
Whereas the, school I started in England,
which used project based tasks,

199
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,840
the whole premise of that approach was
kids have these open ended projects.

200
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,220
And different kids could take it in
different places, so

201
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,720
what you saw is higher achieving kids
really took them up to high levels,

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,540
you know, you could go anywhere with them,
really.

203
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,720
So, I think the thing I wanted to just
stress is that,

204
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,070
you need to change the task that the kids
are given.

205
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,250
And I don't think un-tracked groups really
work really short

206
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,368
procedural math questions.

207
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:31,154
>> Right, right.

208
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:34,100
>> Those are focused on one way of
thinking.

209
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,250
They need to be more open and in the way
that I talked about task.

210
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,900
But I think you know that there's training
that needs to be done and

211
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,190
really support, teaches me support.

212
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,032
If I'm moving from tracks into groups
because they're different.

213
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,450
>> I agree, yeah.
>> I also have found though,

214
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,580
that I mean we worked with schools in
England that we didn't have more support

215
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,660
and they put kids into untracked groups
and

216
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,520
they gave them bigger problems
>> And

217
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,740
the teachers were so surprised at how well
it went.

218
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,930
So they were saying to us wow, when I gave
this different kind of problem, it was

219
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,100
that kid who would have been in the bottom
group, and he came up with the idea.

220
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,890
And they really could see how kids were
being much more engaged, and

221
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,520
certainly these schools are working within
Vista, the teachers were saying to

222
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,850
me last week that it's the first time
they've taught kids from all levels, and

223
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,663
it had just been wonderful is the way she
described it to me.

224
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,947
>> Oh, wow.

225
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,724
Wow!

226
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:34,980
>> So, it's definitely great if there's
training involved, but also I think you

227
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,570
can faith that when you un-track grouped
kids, if you give them problems that

228
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,074
are really more open, that they'll raise,
they'll rise up to the challenge.

229
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,210
>> Right.
So, so

230
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,191
basically, having multiple entry points
but a high expectation.

231
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,764
>> Mm-hm, yeah I think that's.

232
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,020
>> And so that will help them.

233
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,150
>> I mean I do, some people ask always
about the high kids,

234
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,058
are the high kids held back.

235
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,170
>> Yeah.
>> And I should note that you know,

236
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,330
that is not what's found in resesarch when
schools are untracked.

237
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,570
What we find is that the high achievers do
really well, actually.

238
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,160
Better than kids in high top tracks in
other schools and you know it's good,

239
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,890
it turns out,

240
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,640
one thing is the level of discussion kind
of rises to the higher kids.

241
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,600
It doesn't fall to the lower achieving
kids.

242
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,290
But the other thing is they get more kids
to explain.

243
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,770
We all know as teachers,

244
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,824
when you're explaining something, it's a
much deeper level of understanding.

245
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:33,554
>> Yeah, yeah.

246
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:37,890
>> So, you know can be really good for
the, all kids So the other thing I

247
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,552
guess my book has some more detail If
people are moving to one track groups.

248
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:43,067
>> Mm-hm.

249
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,680
>> So my book which is called What's Math
Got To Do With in, in the U.S. and

250
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,430
The Elephant in the Classroom in the U.K.
both give much more

251
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,732
detail descriptions of the schools that
are working in one tracks ways.

252
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,210
>> Okay.

253
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,670
So another question about procedural
knowledge.

254
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:08,850
How do you teach procedural knowledge
through an inquiry-based approach?

255
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,998
>> Yeah.
>> And for upper-level classes.

256
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,010
>> Mm-hm.

257
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,214
Yeah so I think there were a few questions
about that.

258
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,770
>> Yeah.
>> We saw how do you teach the more

259
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,990
procedural aspects of an algebra course
for example.

260
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,687
>> Mm-hmm, mm -hm.

261
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:26,190
>> From people who really liked more open
tasks but couldn't see all the ways that

262
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,493
those procedural bits of knowledge could
fit in.

263
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:32,274
>> Right.

264
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:35,960
>> So, I, I guess I have a couple of
responses to that.

265
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,150
One thing is there are more procedural
parts that need to

266
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,384
be learned in the current curriculum,.

267
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:42,251
>> Mm-hm.

268
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:46,280
>> This like collecting like terms and you
know,

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,285
all sorts of things with algebraic
expressions really but,.

270
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:54,488
>> All of procedural knowledge can be
taught conceptually.

271
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:55,290
>> Yeah

272
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,550
>> In fact, what researchers are finding
now is that you need to

273
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,606
hold all knowledge conceptually, even if
procedure,

274
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,062
>> Hmm
>> isn't held conceptually, it's.

275
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,666
>> Hm
>> Really hard to use it anywhere.

276
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,199
>> Right.

277
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,860
>> So I don't see this distinction between
procedure and, and

278
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,424
conceptual knowledge because you need to
hold those procedural ideas conceptually.

279
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,052
>> Mm hmm.

280
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:19,710
>> The other thing is though how well kids
do,

281
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,570
when they don't, when we don't focus on
procedures.

282
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,225
So.

283
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:26,660
>>at Phoenix Park, one of the schools I
worked in I talked a lot about in

284
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,000
the course, they worked on big projects
all the time.

285
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,300
For three years, projects that took their
interests,

286
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,070
the teachers would give them ideas and
they would take them all of these ways.

287
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:45,720
They didn't cover all of that procedural
>>knowledge that people see in the exams,

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,510
but they still did better on the national
exam than kids that practiced on those

289
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,120
procedures and better than average even
though they came in on much lower levels.

290
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,830
So what the teachers did in that school,
is they were hooked on projects for

291
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,090
three years and literally four or five
weeks before the exam they

292
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,250
gave them exam papers That learning of,
you know

293
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,110
thinking that because they'd been thinking
all the time in their maths approach.

294
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,630
When they were given, like, solve these
two sim,

295
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,380
solve these simultaneous equations.

296
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,396
Do you call differently in the U.S.?

297
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,668
>>Systems of equations.

298
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:24,214
>>[chuckles] Oh, yeah, that's beyond my
level.

299
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:24,844
[laughs]

300
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,230
>> Then--
>> I'm elementary.

301
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,060
[laughs]
>> I know.

302
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,540
I know [INAUDIBLE] elementary classrooms,
which is a good thing.

303
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,740
So they worked it out because they went
into all those procedural

304
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,080
questions thinking "I know how to do it so
I know nothing is going to stump me." So

305
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,690
So first of all I think when kids will
learn in much more depth and

306
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,530
they learn to think and they're always
reasoning,

307
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,940
problem solving, those procedural
questions are not difficult for them.

308
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,990
But the other thing is,

309
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,850
even when we want to teach those bits of
content that we just can't see a way.

310
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,040
In the bigger activities, there are ways
to do that conceptually too.

311
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,870
Collecting like terms, algebraic
equivelants, those things seem very,

312
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,720
you know, hard to develop through big
activities, but whatever the Mathematics.

313
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,590
There are ways to make them more engaging
for kids.

314
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,670
The Shell center which the reference is
on,

315
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:31,270
the Wiki, for Shell center, has great
activites and

316
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,340
one of them for example is called
interpreting algebraic expressions.

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,700
And they give to kids.

318
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,020
There are four expressions that are shown
in four different ways, table --

319
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,786
through a table, through a picture,
through words and through symbols,

320
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:54,960
and there are cut-out sheets that teachers
can use with lots of them on And

321
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,560
kids get a set of them, and then they have
to go and find their partners, and,

322
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,850
you know, so I might have this picture,
and I'd think "What is the algebraic

323
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,130
equivelent of this?" And I'd have to go
and find somebody else who has that.

324
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,620
So you can get kids moving around,
thinking about equivelance, or

325
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,440
they can do it on the table, I mean,
however teachers want to do it.

326
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,260
But, there's really nothing that can't be
taught conceptually.

327
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,250
I think our biggest friends in

328
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,310
teaching conceptially even with more
procedural content representations.

329
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,100
I am always asking kids can you represent
this, can you show it in another way?

330
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,130
And then just always asking about sense
making.

331
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,380
Why does it make sense?

332
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,188
How can you, why can you do that?

333
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:39,705
>> Right.

334
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:43,798
>> Why does it make sense to do that, why
would we want to do that and why.

335
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,480
>> Yeah.
>> Asking those questions

336
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,465
changes something from being very
procedural to being much more conceptual.

337
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,550
>> I agree, I agree.

338
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,197
Good advice.

339
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:57,290
>> [LAUGH]
>> So another question that

340
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,840
comes up which is big in the United States
is how do these ideas fit in with

341
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,164
what's needed to score well on the SATs
>> Mm-hm.

342
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:06,552
>>And to get into competitive colleges?

343
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:07,294
>>Mm-hm.

344
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:09,926
>>Um, and is there room for competitivenes
in this.

345
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:10,766
>>Mm-hm.
>>View of math?

346
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,643
>> education.

347
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,530
>> Yeah, so you probably got from
watching my course that I'm not a big

348
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,726
fan of competitive math teaching.

349
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:18,578
>> Yes.

350
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:21,260
>> And my answer to that questions is
there room for

351
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,310
competitiveness in this view of math
education?

352
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,340
There's room sure but is there a need for
it?

353
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,045
no, I would say not and I think.

354
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:35,420
>> Some kids thrive on competition and if
you make things into a race or

355
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,200
a competition where we stack people up in
terms of who won,

356
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,640
it can engage kids for sure.

357
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,142
Particularly boys it seems.

358
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,670
>> Mm-hm.
>> Are more engaged by that approach but

359
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,820
There are a lot of kids who are put off by
that kind of competitive approach.

360
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,320
And I think with math in particular, where
people are already,

361
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,260
there's already a lot of opportunity for
people to get stressed.

362
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,750
You know, I'm not a fan of
competitiveness, and

363
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,790
I don't think competitiveness in the
classroom makes

364
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,115
people better prepared

365
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,856
>> Either to do well on things like SAT's
or to get into college.

366
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,208
>> Right.

367
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,730
>> Those kids who do well are kids who
feel comfortable with math and

368
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,950
with numbers and feel secure in their
understanding.

369
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,380
So I would say we teach for

370
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,400
understanding then that's the best
opportunity kids have to do well.

371
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,406
On tests and just thriving competitive
environments as well.

372
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,800
>> I think that's good advice.

373
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,720
Do you have any more concrete examples of
steps to

374
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,229
take with students of various ages to
shift their mindset?

375
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,440
Yeah, that's a really good question, and
lots of people I think, in the course,

376
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,600
really like the mindset ideas, and
understood their importance, and

377
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,340
asked "How can we really shift kids?" So,
there are good resources out there, and

378
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,000
websites, Brainknowledgy is the website
that has a student intervention course.

379
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,150
And that's one thing that can be done.

380
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,420
I think that course that schools pay for
and that students can go

381
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,479
through in intervention, it really teaches
kids the same as I taught in this course.

382
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,204
>> Mm hmm.

383
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:25,020
>> That the brain can grow, that it's you
know, muscle, that it grows and gets a.

384
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,490
People can get smarter the more work they
do.

385
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,180
I think as well as if you want to be more
math focused,

386
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,020
playing them some of the videos from the
course might be,

387
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,170
I mean they weren't designed for students
and classrooms, but

388
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,630
I think some of the mindset videos
>> Might be useful to show kids.

389
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,290
Particularly, I think the key messages for
kids to shift their mindset is the one of

390
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,240
the brain growing and how the brain grows.

391
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,915
And the new evidence we have on brain
growth.

392
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:54,814
>> Uh-huh.

393
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,360
>> Ability grows.

394
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,652
Very important to keep stressing the
message that math is about effort.

395
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,220
>> Yeah.
>> It's

396
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,195
not about some people being smart and some
people being not.

397
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,380
>> And I think the mistakes message is
really good for

398
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,006
kids too that, you know, when you make
mistakes, your brain grows.

399
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:11,452
>> I agree.

400
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,130
>> And we can keep reinforcing these
messages.

401
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,170
I had a conversation with my daughter,
I've been having a few lately [LAUGH] on

402
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,150
that very topic last night, when she was
on her math homework, and she got stuck.

403
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,720
And she was saying "Help me!

404
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,293
Help me!

405
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:27,150
I don't know what to do, I don't know what
to do!" And

406
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,550
I knew that she was able to, you know,
make progress.

407
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,300
It wasn't
>> Like I left it floundering, but

408
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,130
I said "Ay!

409
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,720
I can't help you, even if it's hard, and
you make mistakes!

410
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,900
That's so great for you!

411
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,130
Cause your brain will grow!

412
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,920
I don't want to deny that opportunity to
you, for

413
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,660
your brain to grow, as you make mistakes
and struggle."

414
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,615
>> Yeah, what kind of a mother would you
be?

415
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:45,340
>> Exactly!

416
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,120
[NOISE] [LAUGH] Anyway.

417
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,020
So there were lots of opportunities to

418
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,220
keep giving kids >>So these messages about
brain growth and about effort.

419
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,720
Yeah.
>>So what are your

420
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,175
thoughts on natural ability, I mean is
there such a thing or?

421
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:01,030
>>Yes.

422
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,830
So some people asked about that I think
because of most very strongly saying this

423
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,718
there's no such thing as math people and
non-math people.

424
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:08,412
>>Yeah.

425
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:12,240
>>Um, surely some peop, there are people
out there who can.

426
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Win the Fields medal or whatever.

427
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,970
So I guess what I think about that is,
scientists know that,

428
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,420
you know, there's some things that come
genetically, but

429
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,970
they're very small, and the amounts are
very small.

430
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,640
And it's massively outweighed by all the
things that happen in the environment and

431
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,300
in the home and in the school.

432
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:38,790
so, I w- -- the way I think about it is
that people think math

433
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:44,350
is somehow a gift or somewhat in a, a
massively out -- y'know,

434
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,890
in -- out of proportion to that amount
[INAUDIBLE] , which is very, very small.

435
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,340
So, to me, it doesn't matter, really,

436
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,365
whether people are Born with some
advantage or not.

437
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,483
What matters is
>> Right.

438
00:23:55,483 --> 00:24:00,270
>> when we get kids to us we know that all
of them can achieve and that,

439
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,302
and that, because achievement is about
learning and hard work.

440
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:04,470
>> Right, right.

441
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,030
>> So, I think, I mean, when I talk about
everybody can learn and grow.

442
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,690
I, I know, of course when we teach math.

443
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,420
In classes.

444
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,280
There are kids who are faster than other
kids.

445
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,050
So one thing is faster doesn't mean
better, of course, maths

446
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,474
classrooms are often based on idea that
they're fast that means they're better.

447
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:29,650
But also You know, what matters is, we
take those kids,

448
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,940
even those who are struggling who, who
don't seem to have much of an idea.

449
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,620
>> Mm hmm.
>> And

450
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,844
know that those kids can get to where we
want them to get to.

451
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:38,600
>> Right
>> And to very high levels.

452
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,550
I mean one of the studies I referenced in
the course was

453
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,580
a three week intervention which changed
the structure of people's brains.

454
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,205
So.

455
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:48,880
>>you know it just doesn't make sense to

456
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,820
think why this kid hasn't got the brains
to do it.

457
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,363
That's really old fashioned thinking, so--
>> And it's damaging.

458
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,330
>>And it's very damaging, yes.

459
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,708
So I don't think it's even worth thinking
about is there's such a thing kids who

460
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:06,150
are-- I mean what's important to know is
how these kids do is

461
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,950
in your power as teachers No matter where
they come in.

462
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,900
And one of the, one of the best teachers
I've ever seen, [INAUDIBLE]

463
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,190
always talks about, he never thinks about
who's going to do well on a task or

464
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,130
who can do a task before he gives out a
task.

465
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,480
So whereas other teachres are saying well,
so and so will get this or this kid's

466
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,280
going to kind this easy or challenging or
they're not going to get it.

467
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,295
He always.

468
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,090
>> Resist that?

469
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,140
And says I don't know that.

470
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,660
And so I give out this task, because kids
constantly surprise me, and

471
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,790
he just doesn't hold that idea.

472
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,138
And it's really, you can see the teaching,
how productive that is for the kids.

473
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,040
>> Yeah, yeah.

474
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,780
A lot of times you just have to believe
that they can do it, and

475
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,935
show them they can do it.

476
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:50,360
>> Yeah, some of the people are saying
the hardest thing to give up,

477
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,225
I've had tweets of people saying the
hardest thing to give up the smart word.

478
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,390
>> because their so used to saying

479
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,426
>> Yeah.
>> Oh you're smart, you can do this.

480
00:25:57,426 --> 00:25:58,738
>> Yeah.

481
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:02,090
>> so, you know, these are shifts in the
way we think it's really important not to

482
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,658
say people you are smart you can do this
but.

483
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:04,289
>> Right.

484
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:04,840
>> We can say to them,

485
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,600
you know, it's great that you're learning
this and you'll be able to learn it.

486
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,980
And some schools still use the smart word
but

487
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,550
they use it in a way of everybody can get,
can be smart.

488
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,170
And there are many ways to be smart, and
everybody can do it.

489
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,920
And we have to learn to be smart,
smartness is about effort.

490
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,600
I mean I think, the smart is so, the word
smart, or

491
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,710
bright if you're in England, probably.

492
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:32,810
Is so related to a fixed view, that I just
choose, I think it's

493
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,880
better just to nix the word all together,
and not bring it in in any way.

494
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,930
But, yeah, these are hard changes for us
to make, and

495
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,100
it's really great that people are working
on it.

496
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,515
I had to change the way I spoke to my
kids.

497
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:48,325
>> [INAUDIBLE] more of that mindset.

498
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:52,530
>> I agree, I had to change the way I
spoke to the steppies that I teach,

499
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:58,460
the student teachers, I had to, I had to
be more careful about the words I chose.

500
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,420
So, it is hard to change.

501
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,140
The next question, people want to know how
to handle administrators and parents.

502
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,635
What do you do when administrators are,
are

503
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,240
>> Forcing you to teach, or

504
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,416
pressuring you to teach in a traditional
manner, even though you know...

505
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:19,910
>> Yeah, that's a really tough one.

506
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,120
It's a good question.

507
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,430
And I, I work with a lot of teachers all
year, and some of them will say to me,

508
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,140
you know, my administration is telling me
to Have the kids in rows,

509
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,575
have them work in silence, or

510
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:35,360
-- some of them -- one of the teachers I
work with is doing a number talk, and

511
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,540
the principal came in and says, "Oh, this
is too easy; we've gotta stop this." So

512
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,570
that's the hardest thing, if you really
are doing this important changes that

513
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,690
we know are needed from research and you
have people from above telling you not to.

514
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,530
So What do you do?

515
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,018
I think we have to teach administrators
the same as

516
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,018
>> yeah

517
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,340
>> teachers.

518
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,230
I mean, I, there were, I opened,

519
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,088
I tried to get administrators to take this
course and some of them, some did.

520
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:01,778
>>uh huh.

521
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:05,970
>>um But also we should, I think we should
give them things to read and do.

522
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,180
There are lots of good short articles.

523
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,530
I have a short article on time tests as
some people asked how do

524
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,980
we Convinced our administration about
timed tests.

525
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,532
>> And parents.

526
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:20,400
>> And parents too can read articles about
timed tests and

527
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,900
about the need to teach for understanding.

528
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,390
There were good, short articles.

529
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,956
We could get them to take my course,
maybe.

530
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,410
>> Yeah.
>> That would be a good thing for

531
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,629
administrators and parents.

532
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,850
And the website [UNKNOWN] that I'm putting
out.

533
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,790
We also have a section for administrators,
and a section for

534
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,860
parents, cause we do need to educate
everybody in this.

535
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,600
It's not, enough.

536
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,480
And I think we've suffered in mathematics
education from not bringing parents and

537
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,820
administrators along.

538
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,560
When the reforms in the 1990s were really
big, and

539
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,665
schools

540
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:57,386
>> Parents were easily, managed by people
who want reform, and so

541
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,320
>> yeah

542
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,280
>> And encouraged to oppose them because
we didn't work with parents.

543
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,575
So, it's really important, and the.

544
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:13,495
>>The parents who want time tests and-
well administrators and

545
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:16,960
parents- I'm thinking we have to get them
more knowledgeable about that.

546
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,095
I know there were some other questions
about time tests.

547
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,250
>>There are.
They wanted to know how important it

548
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,318
is for students to memorize multiplication
tables.

549
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:26,174
>>Oh yeah.

550
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,600
>>Is that important?

551
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,790
Is there need for automaticity or

552
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,208
what we call "automaticity?"

553
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:37,500
>> So I think that automaticity- that word
is in the common core.

554
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,260
Lots of people want automaticity, so
automaticity is good.

555
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,110
If you can be quick with math facts it's
not a bad thing,

556
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,762
but >>How necessary is it and how much do
we sacrifice in pushing for that?

557
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:50,534
>>Mm-hm.

558
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:53,920
>>So being quick with math facts being,
knowing your times tables.

559
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,300
I don't know my times tables actually.

560
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,720
I was in the progressive era in England
where they got rid of times tables and

561
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,076
I never learned them as a child.

562
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:02,882
>>Mm-hm.

563
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:06,630
>>But I can, you know, work them out
pretty quickly it's never held me back,

564
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,270
that I didn't Memorize time tables.

565
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,020
And [UNKNOWN] does not come from giving
students timed tests.

566
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,700
What we know from timed tests is the fast
kids stay fast, and

567
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,730
the slow kids stay slow.

568
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,250
What encourages [UNKNOWN] is comfort with
numbers, and understanding.

569
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,890
You can do lots of great things with
mental math practice, and

570
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,465
number talks, as I've said, are ideal for
practicing mental math.

571
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:37,770
>> When kids, it's great to practice
that, I'm really not saying kids

572
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,110
shouldn't have an opportunity to practice
things like multiplication facts.

573
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,756
But not to practice them under timed
conditions

574
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:46,982
>> Yes.

575
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:51,290
>> And also not only practice them, but
also to understand the numbers.

576
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,560
So Number talks are great.

577
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,590
But there's other number work that can be
done too.

578
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,370
It's really good.

579
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,140
Work with the hundred square as we called
it in England.

580
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,851
And I think
>> Yeah.

581
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:02,749
The hundreds chart.

582
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,810
>> The hundreds chart, thank you.

583
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,820
It's hard to be bilingual, you know.

584
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,810
>> I know.
>> I'm working on it still but.

585
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,900
And there are lots of, actually, there are
good apps, most of the apps that I see for

586
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,470
phones and other things are pretty
procedural practice, you know,

587
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,040
which is fine, if kids are enjoying them.

588
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,340
But also you want kids to work with number
sense.

589
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,910
And, understand so that...

590
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,480
There's actually a really good new app
that's just come out that Keith Deblin was

591
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,275
working on, Could wuzzit trouble.

592
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:34,862
W-U-Z-Z-I-T.
How do you say that?

593
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:37,660
W-U-Z-Z-I-T.

594
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,280
Wuzzit trouble.

595
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,100
And that's nice because it's an app that
encourages logic and problem solving but

596
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,180
also practice with numbers, factors of
multiples, so.

597
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,334
Though great ways for kids to practice.

598
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:53,957
>> Mm hmm
>> Ken kens I like a lot.

599
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:54,540
>> I do to.
>> If you don't know

600
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,220
what ken kens are, google them.

601
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,970
They're really nice number, number
problems that kids have so teach for

602
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,600
number sentences is the most important
thing for automaticity.

603
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,585
Comfort with numbers understsanding
numbers, number sense.

604
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,610
>> [INAUDIBLE] math facts is fine, but

605
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,875
we don't need time test, they're not what
encourages that in the best way.

606
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,400
>> So, thanks for

607
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,632
taking the time for sitting down to talk
with us about these questions were asked.

608
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:27,460
>> Yeah!

609
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,038
It's been great, and
>> We didn't answer all 300 as I said.

610
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:32,950
>> Yeah.
>> So I'm sorry if

611
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,660
your question didn't get answered.

612
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,420
We went for the ones that had the most
votes.

613
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,780
>> Yeah.
>> And those people needed to know the

614
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:43,730
answers too, but I hope it's been helpful,
and thanks again for taking the course.
