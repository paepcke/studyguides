1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,630
I've taught you lots about an inquiry
relationship that students need.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,950
I've seen this relationship.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,520
I've seen it in many fortunate adults such
as those I've interviewed.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,860
But also in two sets of school students
that I wanted to tell you about.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,881
So, in the UK I studied students in two
schools over three years,

6
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,180
who were taught math completely
differently.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,364
So, I collected a lot of data on their
learning experiences and

8
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:26,870
their achievement, including the results
of their national exam in England.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,535
One of the, one school taught
traditionally,

10
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:33,950
watch me demonstrate methods and then
practice them.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,050
The other taught an inquiry approach to
maths.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,550
Both sets of students started in three
years at the same levels.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, I'm not going to go through the
study, but there's a book on it and

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
also papers that are downloadable from my
website but I will say a few things.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,720
At the school I called Phoenix Park, they
were taught in heterogeneous groups, and

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,640
they were given big problems to solve.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,270
If they needed some mathematical method
they didn't know to solve the problem,

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,160
they were taught it within the problem.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,353
They were constantly challenged to ask
questions,

20
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:07,950
take problems in their own directions and
be curious about math.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,862
The students left that school not only
better problem solvers, but

22
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,360
they also did better on the traditional
national exam.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,877
In the other school that I called Amber
Hill,

24
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:20,252
they were taught the standard method
through demonstration and practice.

25
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,605
But the students were bored by maths and

26
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:25,320
they didn't understand most of the methods
they were taught.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,475
As an example of this, in their national
exam, which I was able to go and analyze.

28
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:33,205
There was a question on simultaneous
equations or

29
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:37,080
systems of equation as they're called in
the U.S.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,230
And things partly weren't taught that
method.

31
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,520
But in the exam, twice as many Phoenix
Park students felt that question right.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,210
Only 26% of the Amber Hill students solved
the problem.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,735
The rest of them used a confused and
jambled version of the procedure.

34
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,630
So, they tried to use it, but not
successfully.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,710
The Phoenix Park students were much more
successful by looking at the situation and

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,150
the numbers and, and making sense of it.

37
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,406
So, these interview quotes will give you a
sense of how students who weren't taught

38
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:08,636
through standard questions and didn't
practice on the questions for three years.

39
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:13,000
Like those in the traditional school ended
up doing better on the national exam.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,575
So, this is Adrian from Phoenix Park just
reflecting on the exams when he said I

41
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:21,420
tend to go into them anyway just thinking
that I can do them.

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,690
Yeah, there wasn't any time I though well
this is this, this is this.

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,730
I just worked it out from the knowledge
that I had.

44
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,462
Contrast that with these two students from
Amber Hill,

45
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:34,395
a traditional school who practiced
endlessly on these questions.

46
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,670
And they said very illuminating things to
me in an interview.

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,550
They said, one of them said, it's stupid
really,

48
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,980
because when you're in the lesson, when
you're doing work, even when it's hard.

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,929
You get the odd one or two wrong, but most
of them you get right.

50
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,179
And you think well when I go into the exam
I'm going to get most of

51
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,690
them right because you get all your
chapters right, but you don't.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,814
And this boy who was very interesting also
said, you can get a trigger,

53
00:02:56,814 --> 00:03:01,070
when she says like simultaneous equations
and graphs, graphically.

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,700
When they say that and, you know, it
pushes that trigger.

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,660
Tells you what to do, and

56
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,030
I asked him, what happens in the exam when
you haven't got that?

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,130
And he said you panic.

58
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,280
So, my question for you, what do these
three responses from the students tell you

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
about why the Phoenix Park students did
better on the national exam than

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,980
the Amber Hill students?
