00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,864
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,258
So welcome to the second session.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,491
Most people believe that people are either
good at maths or they're not or

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:14,567
you need to set brain to be good at maths.

5
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:17,219
And one of the hardest challenges teachers
and parents face is

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,510
dealing with that myth, that only some
students will have to be good in math.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,014
And the student version of the course,

8
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,780
this session, will be an intervention to
shift their thinking about this.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,588
And I found that when I've shown students
what I'm going to show you,

10
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:33,750
they've really changed in their learning
paths.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,673
So first of all,

12
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:40,770
why is the idea that only some students
can be good at math so prevalent?

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,000
Particularly will talk more about the US
and the UK and countries in the west.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,976
So, these days, I'm spending far too much
time watching teenage TV shows because I

15
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:53,010
have two daughters.

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,870
And I have been amazed by the messages
about math that

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,175
students are literally bombarded with.

18
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:03,021
Math is hard, they see over and over
again.

19
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,503
And scenarios such as this one,

20
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:08,540
that two of my students helped with, are
just shown repeatedly.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,431
I can't count the number of times I've
seen something like this in one of

22
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,730
the shows.

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:21,846
[SOUND].

24
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,475
>> So what are you working on?

25
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:28,247
>> [SOUND]
Algebra.

26
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:30,398
>> As well as scenarios like that.

27
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:35,330
A funny one I saw recently, had a caveman
who was called Cavey.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,514
And he was sitting, finishing all of his
English homework, and

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,730
he was saying, oh I'm really happy to do
this, I love literature.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,590
And then his friend goes over to him and
said, huh, you still have math to do, and

31
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,650
hands him his math homework.

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,898
And he goes berserk, jumping up and down,
angrily beating his stick, so

33
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:54,146
that's another image for kids, and those
ideas that math is hard, or

34
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:57,962
even worse you see kids telling other
kids, I just can't do math,

35
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:04,020
which is a totally fixed mindset messages.

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,653
These are given to students all the time

37
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:16,884
through the media and these messages

38
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:26,537
make kids feel a number of things.

39
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,334
So, I have a question for you now.

40
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:33,852
What I would like you to do is to write
down in the forum, where you think,

41
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:41,730
besides television, kids get these
negative messages about maths.
