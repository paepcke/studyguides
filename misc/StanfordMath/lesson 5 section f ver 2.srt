1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,002
Okay so this is Kathy writing about

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:16,904
the Dot Card Number Talks.

3
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,780
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,400
Okay.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,080
Now we're going to look at a number number
talk.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,200
And as you watch this video, you're going
to see Kathy enact a number of practices.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,900
Or what we might call teacher moves that
are really important in number talks.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,610
So keep a note, or a mental note of what
you think they are.

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,742
Because after the video, I'm going to ask
you to write them down and

10
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:41,848
also comment on someone else's submission,
so

11
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:46,198
this is going to be like a peer assessment
type of writing.

12
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,058
>> We're going to try a different number
talk this time and

13
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:53,790
this time it's with numbers and it's
going to be multiplication.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,490
Okay, so get ready to think.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,586
And the

16
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:09,698
problem

17
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:15,821
is.

18
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:22,974
And if your thumb is already

19
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:28,572
up you might try to see

20
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:36,347
if you could see it a different

21
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:43,507
way.

22
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:49,567
Okay, so I'm seeing most

23
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:56,216
people's thumbs.

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,600
Is anybody willing to share what they
think the answer might be?

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,338
[SOUND].
Okay, Joe, what do you think?

26
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:11,338
>> 720.

27
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,062
>> Does anybody have another idea about
what the answer might be?

28
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:23,216
>> Okay Shay?

29
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,658
>> 725.

30
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:29,322
>> I change mine.

31
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,770
[LAUGH]
>> Hold on.

32
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,511
Does anyone have a dif,

33
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,990
an idea, a different idea about what the
answer might be?

34
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,555
Okay, so Joe, what's the matter?

35
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:40,960
>> What I, I realize what I did.

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,128
I I think Shay and I probably both got to
750, but she accurately subtracted 25,

37
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:49,034
and I subtracted 30.

38
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,464
because I was confused by the rounding I
was doing, from 29 to 30.

39
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,470
>> That's good.

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,468
That's good.
You were, so I'll have you, actually, so,

41
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,580
you're saying that you want to disagree
with this answer then?

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,145
>> Yeah, yeah, I want to disagree with my
answer, yes.

43
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,980
>> Okay, so you're agreeing that the
answer's 725.

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,695
>> Yes.
>> Okay, so

45
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,390
let's go through your method then, Joe.

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,781
And you can show us what you did wrong.

47
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:10,169
>> What I did was I rounded 29 to 30 to
make a friendly number.

48
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:18,703
>> Okay, so we're doing 25 times 29, but
you decided to do 25 times 30 to.

49
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:19,459
>> Mm-hm.

50
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,340
>> Because.

51
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,536
>> To, because 30 is a friendly number
and, and easier to multiply with.

52
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:30,564
>> Okay, alright.
>> And then what I did was I broke

53
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:39,450
25 up into 10 plus 10 plus 5.

54
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,915
So what that does is you can multiply 30
by each of those numbers, so

55
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:46,285
that turns into 300 plus 300 plus 150.

56
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,376
>> So you multiplied 30 times each one of
those numbers?

57
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:48,958
>> Yes.

58
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,640
>> 10 plus 10 plus 5.

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,611
Okay, and then?

60
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:57,667
>> So 30 times 10 is 300.

61
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:05,602
Plus 30 times 10, which is 300.

62
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:11,106
Plus 30 times 5 which is 150.

63
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:11,894
>> Okay.

64
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:16,938
>> So I added those up and that equals
750.

65
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:18,954
>> Okay.

66
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:23,679
>> And then I knew because I rounded 29 up
to 30 I had to subtract a number and,

67
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,960
I think I just got a little confused.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,184
Instead of subtracting the 25, which is
what we're, I'm really doing here,

69
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:35,935
multiplying by an extra, you know, adding
an extra 25 in the multiplication.

70
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,713
>> How do you know you're adding an extra
25 in the multiplication?

71
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:47,062
>> Because I'm doing 25 times 30, which is
25 times 29 plus 25.

72
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,386
>> Oh, okay.

73
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,444
>> Yeah.

74
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,742
>> So, you added too many 25s.

75
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:52,510
>> Yes, exactly.

76
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,035
>> And you want to take away one.

77
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,801
>> And I want to take away 25, which
would.

78
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:56,566
>> So you got.

79
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,100
>> Yeah.
>> And then you got.

80
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,995
>> That would be 725, but I accidentally
did minus 30 in my.

81
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,094
>> But you almost did.

82
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:07,358
>> Confusion, and that would have.

83
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,134
[CROSSTALK]
>> That's an interesting mistake, though,

84
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:09,778
minus 30.

85
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:10,925
>> Yes, it is an interesting mistake.

86
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,040
>> Where do you think the 30, what were
you thinking?

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,860
Do you think you were this?

88
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,746
>> I think I just yeah, I got confused, I
think,

89
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:22,843
about which number in the original
equation I was adding an extra of.

90
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:25,158
>> Yeah, that's really complicated.

91
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,904
Did anybody have the same,did anybody else
round up to 30?

92
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:29,520
Oh really?

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,340
Okay, do you want to talk about what you
did?

94
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,604
You don't, Geraldine.

95
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:35,852
Who does want to talk about what they did?

96
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,060
Okay Joe and then.

97
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,069
>> Yeah similar to Joe 25 times 30 was
first initial reaction to create two

98
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,599
friendly numbers but, you know,

99
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,862
knowing there's, there's ways in math that
we kind of make, like, quick shortcuts.

100
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:49,247
>> Yeah.
>> So knowing that 30 makes it more,

101
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:54,620
more, [INAUDIBLE] for me to actually do it
sometimes in my head.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,510
So I just cut the zero off and made 25
times 3.

103
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,090
So I made it into quarters almost.

104
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,226
So three quarters.

105
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,860
>> So you were thinking three quarters.

106
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,208
>> Yeah, so that way, because I know in
the future I will then add the zero,

107
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:12,515
knowing that, that rule applies to all
equations multiplied by a zero at the end.

108
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:19,423
>> So when you did 25 times 29, you, you
did.

109
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,420
>> I did the same thing at 25 times 30.

110
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,725
>> Times 30, but then you were thinking of
quarters.

111
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:24,847
>> Yeah, 25 times 3.

112
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,731
>> So, were you thinking of 3 times 25?

113
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,138
So you were thinking of 3 quarters?

114
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:29,802
>> Yeah.

115
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:34,118
That means 25s, yeah, rings, you know,
quarters amounts in my head.

116
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,023
>> Okay.
So 3 quarters, And you knew that was.

117
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:37,687
>> 75.

118
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:38,351
>> 75.

119
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,094
>> Like cents almost.

120
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:41,131
Yeah.
>> And then.

121
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:41,635
>> So now, I mean,

122
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,235
now I kind of halved the equation already,
because knowing the rule, the zero rule.

123
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:48,005
When you multiply something by zero, you
just add on the zero.

124
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:48,899
>> When you multiply.

125
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,659
>> So, you know, I just kind of did Joe's
method, but

126
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,243
instead of breaking it down, decompose it,

127
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:56,735
I just tried to simplify the, the
equation, and then apply the rule of zero.

128
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:57,800
>> Okay, let me rewind you.

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,560
Did you, I think I heard you say, when I,

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,170
when you multiply by something by zero,
you add a zero.

131
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,905
Is that what you meant?

132
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,941
>> Yeah, anything, anything you multiply,
or is known.

133
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:06,547
>> Go ahead.

134
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,963
>> Any, any, because anything by 10, 20 or
30 you can, you know, cut zero off and

135
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,155
just multiply by the 3 or 2 or 1,
depending on the, the number it is, and

136
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:18,775
then once you get that number, you just
add on a 0 at the end.

137
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:22,152
>> Oh, so you weren't multiplying by 0,
you were multiplying by.

138
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:22,942
>> 2, yes.

139
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,044
>> A multiple of 10.

140
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,064
>> Multiple of 10, yes.

141
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:26,669
>> okay.
>> So, I guess what I'm trying to say is

142
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,754
that I definitely broke it down.

143
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:29,319
>> Okay.
>> So

144
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,492
that I was multiplying by yeah, the tens.

145
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,527
>> Okay.
So, the 25 times 3,

146
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,950
the 3 quarters, helped you know, helped
you think about about the 750.

147
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,342
>> Yeah, just to make it more friendly of
a equation.

148
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:39,700
>> Okay, then that's what we're after.

149
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,840
And so, what did you do then?

150
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,220
>> Yeah, well, you know, same realization,
realization that Joe had is that,

151
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,110
you know, because I round up, I'm round, I
multiply one more 25 than necessary.

152
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,726
And so I subtract that 25 away from 7,
750.

153
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:58,362
So, 750 minus 25, just so that, similar to
Joe,

154
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:04,405
is similar to 75, 25 times 30 minus 25.

155
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:05,710
>> Okay.

156
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,500
Very, very similar.

157
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,008
Okay.

158
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:07,774
>> Very similar.

159
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,765
>> Who did it a completely different way?

160
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,440
Okay.

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,476
Vivian, you want to go?

162
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:18,430
>> I took 25 times 20.

163
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,370
So, I guess, basically, I took apart 20,
29, and made it 20 and 9, first.

164
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,971
And so I did 25 times 20.

165
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,220
>> Okay, so you, you took, you multiplied
25.

166
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,729
>> Yes, and I, I did it kind of similar to
Julio.

167
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,741
And then I, I just took the 0 off with the
rule of the, rule of tens, so,

168
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:42,794
like, I took it off and did 25 times 2 and
I got 50.

169
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:45,378
>> Okay.

170
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:50,566
>> And then I added the 0 back that I had
taken away, so I got 500.

171
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:58,038
>> So if 25 times 2 is 50 then 25 times 20
is 500.

172
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,504
Okay?

173
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:04,300
>> And then from there, I applied the
quarter, the quarter rule.

174
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,030
So I knew that four would make 100, So I
knew that five.

175
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,346
>> You knew that four?
>> Four 25s.

176
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,106
>> Four 25s would make a hundred.

177
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:11,825
>> Uh-huh.
>> Okay.

178
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:15,540
>> So, fours groups of 25, if you add them
together it will make a 100.

179
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,920
So, I saw that there were two groups of 4,
so that's 200.

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,221
So, I had 700, 500 plus 200 is 700.

181
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:23,890
>> Okay.

182
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,940
Rewind for a second.

183
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,879
Where did you see the two groups of 4
quarters?

184
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,034
>> In the 9.

185
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:29,674
>> In the 9.
>> Yes.

186
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:33,595
>> So, when you broke up the 29, you broke
it into.

187
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,483
You were thinking about 29 as?

188
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,287
>> 20 and 9.

189
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,291
>> 20 plus 9?

190
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,493
>> Mm-hm.

191
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,080
>> Okay, and then.

192
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,952
>> And then I broke the nine up into 4, 4
[CROSSTALK].

193
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,003
>> okay, so then you broke the 9 up into
4s, 4.

194
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,448
>> 4, 4, and 1.

195
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,373
>> Plus 4, plus 1.

196
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,335
>> Mm-hm.

197
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,300
>> Okay, now I'm up with you.

198
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,870
Then what?
>> Yeah.

199
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,170
And so I knew that each of the 4s would
represent 100 because I

200
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,214
was multiplying it by 25.

201
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:04,774
>> So I knew 4 times 25 is 100, 4 times 25
is 100, that would make 200, so

202
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:08,775
I added that 200 to the 500.

203
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,600
>> Okay.

204
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,603
So this really represents, for you, 4
times 25.

205
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:13,688
>> Mm-hm.

206
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,470
>> And this represents 4 times 25.

207
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,382
And then, the 1?

208
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,980
>> 25 by just [CROSSTALK]
>> 25, 1 times 25, okay.

209
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,542
And so going back here then, this 9
actually means 9 times 25?

210
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,278
>> Yeah.

211
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:32,122
>> Okay. Whew. Okay, now what?

212
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:36,636
>> Well as I said before, I took the 200
from the 4 times 25, plus 4 times 25,

213
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,474
added to the 500.

214
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:41,520
>> Okay, so you knew this was 100 and 100,
so

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,952
you knew that was 200, and you add that
to.

216
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:45,579
>> To the 500.

217
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,750
>> The 500 you had here?

218
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,994
Okay, 500, okay.

219
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:51,488
>> And that gave me 700.

220
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,196
>> Okay.

221
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,408
And then there is that one 25 left.

222
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:57,176
>> Okay.

223
00:10:57,176 --> 00:11:00,344
>> That I added onto it, and I got 725.

224
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:01,112
>> Okay.

225
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,936
How are we doing on time?

226
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:07,928
Have us think about some of the properties
we talked about.

227
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:13,528
And so I, you've broken up numbers in a
lot of different ways, and

228
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:18,928
so I, what I'd like, I'm going to do is,
I'm going to draw a picture for

229
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:26,690
what I think Joe saw first up here, a
diagram.

230
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,030
And if this is 25.

231
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,710
Joe Joe, as you, you, you saw the 29.

232
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,075
But then you added one more on there.

233
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:41,020
So you multiplied 25 times 30.

234
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,110
And then you subtracted the 25?

235
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,730
>> Yeah.

236
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,370
>> So this part went out.

237
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,910
And this was 25 plus 1.

238
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,280
Does anybody know what property that is?

239
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,565
What Joe did, how you would write it
algebraically.

240
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,750
Talk to each other real quick.

241
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,630
See how you would write this
algebraically.

242
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,701
[CROSSTALK]

243
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:11,694
Too bad we don't

244
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:17,687
have the mics on

245
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:27,414
every table.

246
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,925
Is anybody willing to say what property it
is, and how it works?

247
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:37,962
>> We thought it was the distributive
property, because.

248
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,685
>> You want to say why, Kellen?

249
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,828
>> Yeah.
He, since Joe added 1.

250
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,520
>> Hang on, let me just write it up here.

251
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,625
>> He's now taking his 25 and multiplying
it by both 29 and 1.

252
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,800
>> Okay, so how would you write that?

253
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,625
Do you know?

254
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:59,204
>> 25 times, and then with parentheses.

255
00:12:59,204 --> 00:12:59,983
>> Okay.

256
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,356
>> 29 plus 1.

257
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:03,164
>> 29, which is the original problem.

258
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,860
>> Mm-hm.
>> Plus 1 that he added.

259
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,435
Okay.

260
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,555
>> And then he's distributing the 25
across [CROSSTALK] multiplied by 29.

261
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,356
>> 25 times 29?

262
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,501
One, 20.

263
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,760
Okay, good.

264
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,580
What about one more.

265
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,920
Let's see I just oh, let's see, Julio, you
said three quarters, Joe,

266
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,430
Vivian, how, how would you write Vivian's
using the distributive property?

267
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,190
Talk that one over.

268
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,646
And pre, draw on the desk, like,

269
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:30,711
pretend with your finger, how you would
draw a picture for this.

270
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:34,256
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> Wait, say that again.

271
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:37,790
>> 25 times [INAUDIBLE],

272
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,626
she broke the 29 into 20 and 9, so

273
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:52,385
it would be 25 times 20, and 25 times 9.

274
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:58,080
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> Is anybody willing,

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,381
that, that we haven't heard from yet,

276
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:10,495
to talk, explain this for us?

277
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,947
Stephanie, great, thank you.

278
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:17,320
>> So explaining what would be the
equation, or the picture?

279
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,828
[CROSSTALK]
>> Yeah, well, you could do the picture or

280
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:20,040
the equation, either one.

281
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,865
We can do both separately, if you'd like.

282
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,030
>> Okay.
So first, it would, so

283
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,882
the, it would be 25 and then the 29 would
be broken up into 20.

284
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:30,172
Plus 4 plus 4 plus 1.

285
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:32,050
>> So 20 from.

286
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,680
Oh, this is badly out of whack.

287
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,770
[LAUGH].

288
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,052
It's more like that.

289
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,510
4 plus 4 plus 1.

290
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,110
So you're saying that this is oh well.

291
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,825
[SOUND].
Is that what you're saying?

292
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,316
>> Mm-hm.

293
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,675
>> Stephanie?

294
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:49,780
Okay.

295
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,060
So this whole thing is still 29, but those
are the separate pieces.

296
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,910
Okay, then how would we write it
algebraically?

297
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,460
Somebody else.

298
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,157
[INAUDIBLE]

299
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:08,421
Okay Erin, try.

300
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,560
>> I guess it would be 25 times.

301
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,360
>> I feel like I need a different color
pen somewhere.

302
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,583
Okay.
I'm going to write it over here then.

303
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,573
>> Okay.
>> So, 25 times.

304
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,993
>> Times the quantity of 20 plus 4 plus 4
plus 1.

305
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:20,162
>> What do you think?

306
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:28,032
Yep.

307
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,996
Good.

308
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,430
We are done with our number talk.

309
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,098
Thank you very much.
