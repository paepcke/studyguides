1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,227
So mistakes are important, not only the
huge learning opportunities but

2
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:06,282
they're critical to setting up attitudes
to maths that are about resilience,

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,930
resiliency and the belief that you can do
it.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,520
How great would it be if your child or

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,700
your class of students come in with a
belief that they can do any maths and

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,562
that they're eager to be given complex
problems, such as those in

7
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:23,439
the common core and not to be put off if
their first idea doesn't work.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,055
This is a poster that I used to think was
really good when I saw it in classrooms,

9
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:30,440
and this is what is says.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,392
So the message is good, but not as good as
it can be,

11
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:39,120
I think, given what we now know about
mistakes.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,910
So your assignment now, is I want you to
design a better poster.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,295
So, as the words that matter you can just
type them, but

14
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:49,510
I welcome all [INAUDIBLE] creativity at
all time.

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,303
So, if you want to create a poster or post
some ideas on paper what I

16
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,894
want to do is photograph it and upload
that photograph.

17
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:58,760
And we'll feature some of the good ones on
the site.
