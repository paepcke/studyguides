1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:06,147
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:07,947
So you may think, if you're a high school
math teacher,

3
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:11,350
why go through that when you can use the
formula a plus b over a times b?

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,371
There is a very good reason for going
through that longer method, and

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:17,040
it's about thinking and making sense.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,548
When we provide students with formulas
that they don't understand,

7
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:21,690
they're not useful to them.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,310
If you're lucky they may use them in a
test but often they don't even do that.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,711
You may have used another method that's
more conceptual or

10
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,530
a whole different approach.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,784
So one thing that's missing from most
students' math lives and

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,291
that would help them enormously.

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:42,740
Is knowing about and engaging in what I
call the mathematical thinking process.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,540
So, this is my proposed thinking process
for solving any math question.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,334
So the first thing I do is I read the
question and

16
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,410
think about what it's telling me.

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,225
I just sit with it for a while.

18
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,450
I look at it, think about the numbers.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,269
Students often don't do that as they think
they should instantly know a method or

20
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,130
formula to apply.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,900
I make a lot of use of visuals.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,020
They help me in virtually every problem I
solve.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,580
So, my first strategy is usually to draw
the problem.

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,804
Other people I helped in this stage by
restating the problem, reading it aloud,

25
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:17,239
or writing it in another way.

26
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,470
So I''m going to call this stage the stay
think say draw stage.

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,990
Then there's a point where it's really
helpful to talk to other people to

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,565
discuss problems and possibly consult
resources.

29
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,217
Those actions are some of the most
important things to do in

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,785
any math problem.

31
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:38,530
Estimate is so useful to do at different
stages in a problem.

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,550
What sort of answer should we get at this
stage or in, in this part.

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,725
Where should I be.

34
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:46,670
And at some point, we mathematize.

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,161
That's the process when I bring out my
mathematical methods or tools.

36
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,860
And convert my thinking into something
more formally mathematical.

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,850
And that word comes from Freudenthal.

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,138
There's a process whereby you might try
something, realize it doesn't work,

39
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:04,340
refine it or revise it.

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,573
That process is an essential component of
designed thinking as taught by

41
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,312
Stanford's D school.

42
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:12,368
But it's also an essential part of
mathematical thinking.

43
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:17,319
And then super-importantly, does the
answer make sense?

44
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,480
You may need to stop and ask that at
various stages of a problem.

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,860
So these are the sort of shortened
headings of my mathematical thinking.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,720
So I'm going to show you how those stages
came into play when we worked

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,320
through those solutions.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,224
Because they're all short questions, you
don't see the try and refine and

49
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,330
revise stage.

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,580
But that's super important, especially
when dealing with bigger problems.

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,671
And in these solutions, I didn't consult
others,

52
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,190
even though that's a very important step.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,210
You'll see as I go through these that the
stages are used in a different order.

54
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,350
There isn't one set order as different
problems draw on different parts.

55
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,178
So in solving the turkey problem, the
first thing we did was think about what we

56
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:07,910
had three slices weigh a third of a pound.

57
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,380
So I'm going to call that thinking stop
think process.

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,880
And it was really important to stop and
think about that because that thinking

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,044
about it led to what's a really important
realization that often people don't go to.

60
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:29,610
Which is that if three pieces a third of a
pound, then nine pieces is equals a pound.

61
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,670
And that is a mathematizing move.

62
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,350
From there a really important piece was to
draw it.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,670
And I think at that point once we'd drawn
nine slices.

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,868
And then we made another mathematical move
of

65
00:03:54,868 --> 00:04:00,365
another mathematizing move of dividing
them into quarters.

66
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:06,340
We then stopped right at the end and
thought about that does it make sense.

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,826
And I thought about that by thinking,

68
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:15,660
he was given three slices that weighed a
third but he was only allowed a quarter.

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,529
So it's going to be a little bit under
three slices which is where we

70
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,880
get our answer of 9/4 or 2 1/4.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,390
So, those were the stages of the thinking
process that I used in that problem.

72
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,260
I really stopped and thought about it for
quite some time.

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,951
I drew, mathematized, mathematized again
and

74
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:37,810
stopped to think about it making sense.

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,030
So, in the Charmaine and

76
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,591
Tesha problem there's immediately a lot of
words in this problem.

77
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:46,519
Charmaine and Tesha have cards in the
ratio 2:3, Tesha and

78
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,480
Holly in the ratio of 2:1, Tesha has four
more cards.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,192
This is the kind of problem that instantly
confuses people.

80
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,006
Students and

81
00:04:55,006 --> 00:05:00,946
when I was solving this, the very first
thing I did was to draw the problem.

82
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:05,121
So I'm going to label that as my first
process.

83
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:10,453
And I drew out what I knew, which was that
if we use these blocks to represent

84
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:19,150
ratios, then the relationship between
these three people would look like that.

85
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,048
At that point so I knew Charmaine and
Tesha had cards in the ratio 2:3 and

86
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:28,140
Tesha and Holly in the ratio 2 :1.

87
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,485
At that point, we're given another piece
of information.

88
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,770
Tesha has four more cards than Charmaine.

89
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,620
How many cards to Holly have?

90
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,464
So, I'm going to call that a kind of
mathematizing move although all of this is

91
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,707
very mathematical.

92
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,910
Where we just think about the numbers
here.

93
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,990
So, if we know that Tesha has four more
cards than Charmaine, then Holly,

94
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,893
they may know that each of these blocks
represent two.

95
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,092
And that gives us an answer that Holly has
6.

96
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,170
I then thought about like Holly has 6 just
comes out of the blue.

97
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,590
Does that fit with the problem?

98
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,280
Does it work out?

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,230
And the best way to check it, or

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:13,273
to check that it makes sense is to go back
and put the numbers in for the others.

101
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:21,042
So we did that to find that Charmaine had
8 and Tesha had 12.

102
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:28,373
We knew they cards in the 2:3 so that
solution seems to make sense.

103
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:32,237
In this problem we know that Joe takes 3
hours to paint a house and

104
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,650
Sam takes 5 hours.

105
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,340
How long do they take if they paint it
together.

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,460
So, again the very first stage is to stop
and

107
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,120
think about the information that we have
there.

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,310
And, at this point I found it really
important to estimate.

109
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,469
And so, if Jo takes 3 hours, Sam takes 5
hours and

110
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:59,900
they go to do it together, it has to take
less than 3 hours.

111
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,449
And that's an important insight that I
gained from that estimation.

112
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:09,051
At that point, I drew and again I found it
very helpful to create a visual

113
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:17,110
representation of the houses and the
amount of time they spent on each one.

114
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,157
Then there's definitely some
mathematizing, putting the.

115
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,797
Working out the fraction of each house,

116
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:31,530
working out what that would be together
and turning that into one house.

117
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,750
And then I stopped at the end and thought
about whether that made sense.

118
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,310
We knew it was going to be less than 3
hours with both of them.

119
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,370
What we got to was 1 7/8 of an hour, so
that seemed to make sense.

120
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,890
So the process in this one was different
again.

121
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,894
Stop, think, estimate, draw, mathematize,
make sense.

122
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:55,200
But again many of those different
processes were going on in order to

123
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,870
get that solution.

124
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,156
So I didn't think many students are aware
of needing to go through these

125
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,654
mathematical thinking processes.

126
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:07,650
Especially when they have these short
fraction or algebra problems.

127
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,210
But if I was given any math question,

128
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,814
especially the verbally dense ones such as
the card question.

129
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:15,840
Then I need to engage in these processes
to be successful.

130
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,854
You may be gathering by now that I think
there should be a much larger part played

131
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:22,170
by visual representations in maths.

132
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,920
It helps everybody.

133
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,120
You may have kids who've been given the
idea that they're not a visual thinker.

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,990
That's a kind of misuse I think of Howard
Gardner's multiple intelligences.

135
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,420
But even if they come in with that idea
then.

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,360
They need to work in visual ways more than
anyone else.

137
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,329
Visual thinking and visual solutions, as
we saw with the number problems in

138
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:49,690
the last session, help us see mathematics
as conceptual and meaningful.

139
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,905
Here's my student KK again, talking about
the importance of visuals to him.

140
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,089
>> I think that I'm a, I'm a very visual
learner, so

141
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,267
when it comes to problem I guess words
problems in math.

142
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,627
I just couldn't comprehend them because
I'd be like,

143
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,105
I don't, I can't visualize this.

144
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,865
>> How easy would it have been to engage
students like KK if

145
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,525
maths were taught differently and more
visually.

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,830
One thing that's important making students
aware of these thinking processes is

147
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,765
they learn that working on math is a
process, it's always a process.

148
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:27,160
It's not about instantly coming up with a
method or a formula.

149
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,860
How many students go through this kind of
thinking process or any process.

150
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,460
Many of them think that they should
instantly be

151
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,800
able to solve a math problem or they're
doing it wrong.

152
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,910
So teaching students to engage in a
thinking process is really important.

153
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,798
So what I'd like you to do now is design a
way that you can think of of

154
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:50,809
making children, students aware of the
thinking process.

155
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,270
You, you can use my steps of the thinking
process or you can adapt those or

156
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,958
use your own.

157
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,036
But the question is how can you get
students to start using something

158
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,312
like that?

159
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,380
So this is a peer assessment question.

160
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,419
You're going to be given three different
people's answers to comment on and

161
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,462
yours will be sent out to comments on.

162
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:18,850
