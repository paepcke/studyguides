1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,650
So, one I thought of was my daughter gets
$3 of pocket money or

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,660
allowance if you're in the U.S.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,660
But for every chore she does I add a
dollar.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,640
So, A represents the number of chores in
that expression.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,433
Algebra learning should be about enabling
learners to employ their

6
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:21,270
natural powers and using algebra to make
sense of the world.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,519
And the most fundamental concepts
generalizing in relationships,

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,960
which should be first and foremost.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,624
So, the best way to introduce Algebra as

10
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:36,920
the leading Algebra researchers state is
through patent growth.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,000
And we again see some examples in a
moment.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,350
Jere Confrey, who's another leading
researcher who studies algebra learning,

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,310
calls for a number of things in the
teaching of algebra.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,690
Identifying situations that the students
are excited to investigate.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,287
Motivating that, through the need to
explain, predict and

16
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,200
model, which is the starting road to
Calculus.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,547
Varying representations with visuals,
graphs, tables, descriptions and

18
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:08,800
making algebraic manipulations some think
that helps solve a problem.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,500
Where, when students are manipulating,
that manipulation also has value for them.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,876
And allow students to use problem solving,

21
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:22,090
communications, new technologies to engage
in rich modeling situations.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,260
Another research finding that illustrates
for

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,110
me how disconnected the algebra textbooks
are from research evidence is this.

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,600
I'd like you, in this question, to
represent the cost of apples and pears.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,830
If we know that apples cost $0.10 and
pears cost $0.12.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,530
So, write an expression for that.
