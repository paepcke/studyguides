1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,748
So recently a New York Times columnist
Peter Sims, wrote a really compelling

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:10,280
piece about the critical role of mistakes
in innovation and design thinking.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,753
And he analyzed the differences between
more and less successful entrepreneurs and

4
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:19,540
he found that the successful ones
Basically make more mistakes.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,322
And they learn from those mistakes, and

6
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,520
that learning sets them on the path to
huge success.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,753
But another New York Times columnist and
bestselling author of

8
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:31,657
the book Better By Mistake, Alina Tugend,
has written, correctly in my view,

9
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,622
that we are raising a generation who are
terrified of blundering, of failing,

10
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:42,640
of even sitting with the discomfort of not
knowing something for a few minutes.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,524
I was really stunned last year in a
teacher workshop I was running when

12
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,810
Carol Dweck had given up some time to join
us.

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,763
She said many things that were helpful and
we will hear from her in this lesson but

14
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:57,775
one of them was every time students make a
mistake in maths they grow a new synapse,

15
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:03,080
and that really hit me as very important.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,920
So what we're finding from research is
that when students make a mistake, and

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm thinking this is a kind of core
mistake, not an error such as

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,800
a numerical slip, when they make a mistake
about an idea in math, two sparks happen.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,710
First when they make the mistake, and then
again when they think about the mistake.

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,922
And that brain growth that comes from
those sparks in

21
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:31,730
the brain doesn't happen when people get
work correct, so this was stunning to me.

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,674
And the reason is it turns out that making
mistakes its the most useful thing to

23
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:38,250
be doing.

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,285
The, the very much useful thing in maths,
but

25
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:45,083
students often feel really bad, crushed
even, if they make a mistake in maths.

26
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,603
They think it means that they're not a
math person, but

27
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:51,860
it turns out it's really the most useful
thing they can be doing.

28
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:56,480
Jason Moser and his colleagues published
an article in Psychological Science,

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,548
which I'm putting in the references, and
they reported the evidence of

30
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:03,700
significant brain changes when students
make a mistake.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,188
They also found that the brain growth that
happens was different greater in

32
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:13,370
growth-mindset individuals than in
fixed-mindset individuals.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,674
So again, the greater response of the
growth mindset people and

34
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:19,447
the brain growth they've showed, they were
more aware of

35
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:24,824
mistakes with greater reaction and a
greater accuracy afterwards.

36
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:27,320
It's really amazing and that paper is in
the reference section.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,919
So that evidence points to 2 things for
me, the new science of the brain,

38
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,890
showing us that brains actually change
when people make a mistake.

39
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,860
And, again, the importance of a growth
mindset is it was the growth

40
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,870
mindset people's brains who grew the most.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,024
So we're going to talk more about this new
evidence of what it means for

42
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:50,570
math learning, but before we do that I
want to stop here and ask you a question.

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,468
And that is, what is your reaction to the
information or

44
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:58,807
mistakes that I have given you so far
because I think it's pretty big?

45
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:02,111
So I'm going to ask you to write a
paragraph at least and submit that and

46
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,680
then you will get somebody else's
paragraph.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,380
So this will be a kind of peer assessment
and you will be asked to give them

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,180
a comment on their submission and you will
get a comment on yours.
