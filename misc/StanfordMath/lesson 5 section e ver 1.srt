1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:03,668
So, the answers given and see, you
probably found got some of these, but

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,944
you may be surprised by others.

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:14,825
Were $200, $50, $75, $125, $150, and $175.

4
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:19,121
I, so that seems pretty shocking really.

5
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:23,411
And when they were asked to work out 10%
of $200, the students mainly could find

6
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:28,235
that answer, but they only knew to move a
decimal point.

7
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:31,356
They couldn't make sense of it, or explain
it in any other way.

8
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:36,101
And generally, what Cathy found was that
the students didn't have any sense of

9
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:38,602
what percent means.

10
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:42,143
And we had no idea why the procedures that
they were using worked.

11
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:46,367
And Cathy found that student that were on
track to be successful math students,

12
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,051
they weren't low achievers.

13
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,843
So, what she found in particular,

14
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,692
is that students did not look at the
relationship between quantities.

15
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:59,663
And they saw every problem that was given
as discrete and separate.

16
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:00,511
It was very rare for

17
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:05,236
a student to ever refer back to a previous
problem, when considering a new problem.

18
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,868
Even when it was completely related, and

19
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,740
they could have built from one answer onto
the next.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,761
So, it was really important that those
high school students had

21
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,357
this experience of number talks,

22
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:19,783
because it really would have helped them
in their high school and beyond.

23
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:23,677
I wrote about number talks in my book
What's Math Got to Do With It, or

24
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:26,865
The Elephant in the Classroom.

25
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:30,912
And even reading about the different ways
numbers can be solved opened the eyes of

26
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:35,364
people reading about them in the ways they
thought about math.

27
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:38,172
So, some people like the seventh and
eighth-graders I taught,

28
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:41,088
had thought it was kind of against the
rules to change the numbers,

29
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:45,279
to break numbers apart and put them back
differently.

30
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:49,516
And so here, I'm going to show you a
little bit of Sophie again.

31
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:52,790
Sophie is the film maker that we met in
the first class.

32
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,534
And this is just a short extract from the
interview with her

33
00:01:55,534 --> 00:02:00,557
talking about what happened when she read
about number, number problems.

34
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,997
>> I had one of those aha moments reading
your book,

35
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,230
where you were talking about, you know,
that, that you can move,

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,401
move parts of a number around, like the
numbers aren't fixed.

37
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,089
And I mean, obviously, if you have an
equation, but

38
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:18,057
you know, this is made up of how many 10s
and this is made up of how many 5s, and

39
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:23,487
the, that you can, you can share parts of
the numbers.

40
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:30,071
And I think I've always known that deep in
my subconscious.

41
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:34,060
But I always thought it was breaking the
rules.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,931
>> Yeah.

43
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,694
>> You're not allowed, to break a number,
you know, like, a numbers a number.

44
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,458
Like you're supposed to do the, you know
it,

45
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,500
a number is the one your supposed to be
multiplying.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,031
>> You can't make it into some other
number Yeah.

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,094
>> Even if you're just slipping those
numbers around.

48
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:50,000
So I always felt like I was cheating.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,680
You know, having that articulated, which
was something that I had known, but I had,

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,089
nobody had allowed me the freedom to say,
you are totally allowed.

51
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,192
>> Yeah.

52
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,852
>> To mess with these numbers as much as
you want, until you can, you can do it,

53
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:10,028
you know, if multiplying by ten is the way
it works for you, do it.

54
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:13,033
>> So, I'm hopeful that the student
version of this class.

55
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:16,239
Where students were going to be given
various number problems to do.

56
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,844
Will be a really generative class for
them.

57
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,724
Because in the student version, I'm
going to be able to use more visuals and

58
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:25,132
animations that I didn't have time to do
for this class.

59
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:29,292
But I hope to really expand their thinking
about math by giving them lots of

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,980
opportunities to engage in number sense.

61
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,620
So, there'll be different problems to
choose for

62
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,939
different grade levels, all the way up to
adults.

63
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,523
And I really hope that this number sense
section of the student class will

64
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:44,331
present students with the opportunity to
learn to see and use numbers flexibly in

65
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:50,837
ways that will be enjoyable no matter, you
know, what experience they came in with.

66
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:54,533
So, your task now is to watch two pretty
different videos,

67
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,443
a number talks and action.

68
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,390
One's taught by a third-grade teacher,

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,809
Nick Foote in Barron Park School in Palo
Alto, and

70
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:07,056
one is taught by Cathy to our elementary
teacher candidates in Stanford.

71
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:12,135
So, a really nice way to start number
talks is to dot cards.

72
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:16,518
And these look really simple, they work
great in elementary classrooms.

73
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:19,554
But again, they can be really interesting
for learners of all levels including

74
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:23,194
adults, and you're going to see them now
with Stanford graduates.

75
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:29,737
>> Okay, here

76
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:36,285
it is.

77
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,213
Okay, so I'm seeing everybody's done.

78
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:41,115
Would anybody like to say how many they
think there are?

79
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,960
Okay, Stefanie?

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,655
>> Ten?

81
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,221
>> Ten.

82
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,029
Does anyone have, sorry, does anyone have
a different idea of what,

83
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,200
how many there are?

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,837
>> Okay, so let's share how we saw them.

85
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,532
Who's willing to share how, what they saw?

86
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,308
Okay, Geraldine what'd you see?

87
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:01,723
>> So, I saw three at the top and

88
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:09,246
then the two at the, on the bottom of
those preceding 3, as 5.

89
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,512
>> Okay.

90
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:14,854
>> And then I saw the, the remaining
three, and the other two on the bottom.

91
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:15,887
>> Okay.

92
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:16,688
>> The 5 and 5.

93
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:18,488
>> And did you kind of, you clumped these
as 5 and 5?

94
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,322
>> I clumped the top Okay.

95
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,958
>> Five, and then I clumped the bottom.

96
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,769
>> Okay [CROSSTALK], so this was five for
you?

97
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,431
>> Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,998
>> And this was five for you?

99
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:28,205
>> Yeah.

100
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:29,564
>> So 5 plus 5?

101
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:33,511
>> Yeah.

102
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:36,100
>> Who did it like Geraldine did?

103
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,608
Wow.

104
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,779
Alright, who did it a different way then,
who saw it a different way?

105
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:48,349
Yeah, okay, so could you pass the
microphone to Joe, please?

106
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,551
>> I saw it like people read left to
right, top to bottom.

107
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,711
So, I saw the top line of three, and then
I added the next line of two to make five,

108
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,527
and then I added the next line three to
make eight, and

109
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:04,069
then the next line of two to make ten.

110
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,107
>> So, I'm hearing that you went from left
to right on each one,

111
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:10,048
adding sequentially as you went?

112
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,313
>> Yes, line by line.

113
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:18,755
>> 3, 2, and so your number sentence would
be 3 plus 2 plus 3 plus 2?

114
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,450
>> Absolutely.

115
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,421
>> Okay, anyone do it exactly like Joe
did?

116
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,987
Wow, okay who would like to share their
method of scene it?

117
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:34,264
Okay, so let's hear while you're on and
take it close.

118
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:38,290
All right, so I saw the two lines of
three, going across a line of three, and

119
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,507
then two lines down and another line of
three.

120
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:46,640
And then I saw a square with the remaining
4.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,509
>> Did you hear those little, you know
[NOISE].

122
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,843
Okay, Elana?

123
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,875
So, what I heard you say is that you first
saw the two rows of three, so

124
00:06:54,875 --> 00:07:00,000
three here and three here, and then you
saw a square.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,646
Where's the square?

126
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:04,247
>> So the two in the middle, they're like
the second line down and

127
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,122
the two on the bottom.

128
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:06,738
>> These two?

129
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:07,509
>> Make a square.

130
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,741
>> And these two make a square, so you saw
a square as something like.

131
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,088
>> Like an overlapping square.

132
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,040
>> An overlapping square.

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,759
Alright, and when you did the arithmetic,
what did you do first?

134
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,287
>> So 3 and 3 is 6, and then I can just
see the 4.

135
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,422
Okay, who saw this a different way?

136
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,585
There are so many ways.

137
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:35,775
>> So I counted by two's I saw them in
vertical lines of two.

138
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,055
So, in sort of a zig zag starting from the
left,

139
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:41,302
I saw that there were two top and bottom.

140
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:43,680
>> So you're talking about these two?

141
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,220
>> The very far left two, yup.

142
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,588
>> Okay.
>> And then going immediately to

143
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:47,820
the right of that.

144
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,038
It went down and there were two more.

145
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,272
>> Okay.
>> And then up to two down and up.

146
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:51,932
>> Okay.

147
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:54,732
So, two, two, two, two, two.

148
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:56,378
>> Yup, exactly.

149
00:07:56,378 --> 00:08:04,660
>> Okay, so two, two, two, two, two.

150
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,672
How did you do the, figure out how many
dots there were?

151
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:11,282
>> I was counting in my head as I looked
at them, so I say 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

152
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:16,955
>> So you counted by 2, so 2 plus 2 plus 2
plus 2 plus 2, okay great.

153
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,750
And how about one more method, so.

154
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,225
Okay, Vivian?

155
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:26,690
>> So, I saw them diagonally going this
way down.

156
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,713
So, from the top up going down.

157
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,918
>> From the top left?

158
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:30,640
>> Yes.
>> Come again?

159
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,340
Okay.
>> Yeah, and so

160
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,910
I started with the largest diagonal line,
which had a four in it.

161
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,124
It started with the object furthest to the
top.

162
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:38,804
>> This one?
>> Yeah.

163
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:39,480
>> You saw this four?

164
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
>> It goes straight down, yeah.

165
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
>> Okay.
>> So I saw those four,

166
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,595
then I saw the next three up.

167
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:46,600
>> And then I saw the next two which were
at the bottom.

168
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,332
>> Okay.
>> And then one.

169
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:48,829
>> Okay.
>> And then what?

170
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:54,619
>> So let’s see so you saw four and then
three and then two and then one?

171
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,666
>> Yep.
>> And how did you?

172
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:02,949
>> I knew 4 plus 3, I just knew that was
7.

173
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,175
>> Okay, so you started with 7?

174
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:08,730
>> Yeah, and then from there I just added
on together.

175
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,410
Actually, I, in my mind truly I did it by
ones.

176
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,290
The two and the one.

177
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,910
>> Oh, did you really?

178
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,561
>> Yeah, even though [CROSSTALK].

179
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:20,110
>> So instead of 2 plus 1 you went 7 plus
1 plus 1 plus 1.

180
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,190
That's how you really saw it?

181
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,760
>> No I, sorry.

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
>> No how did you see it?

183
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,106
>> I did it.
>> Oh, this is cool.

184
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,360
>> 4 plus 3.

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,112
>> Okay, so this way.

186
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,854
>> Plus 1, plus 1, plus 1.

187
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:28,457
>> 4 plus 3, so

188
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:34,140
you really did think of the 4 and 3
separately, and then plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

189
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,511
Is that how you saw it?

190
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:36,232
>> Yeah.

191
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:39,030
>> Great.
Okay are there any questions?

192
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,505
We're going to move on to a number, number
talk.

193
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,580
Actually, I want, I don't want to actually
stop.

194
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,235
Does anybody see any similarities between
methods?

195
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:54,280
I see Joe would you

196
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,970
like to share?

197
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,322
>> Oh, well I noticed that we tend to,

198
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:10,075
at least most of us tend to clump the
objects linearly.

199
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:13,060
But in different orientations.

200
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,910
So, Shea would create vertical lines out
of her objects.

201
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,970
Geraldine and I would make horizontal
lines, and Elana as well.

202
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,685
And then, of course Vivian is looking at
them diagonally.

203
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:27,756
>> Okay, so people saw these in really
different configurations.

204
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:32,100
What about Geraldine and Joe's method?

205
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,260
What do people notice about that?

206
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,859
Okay, so Erin?

207
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:42,430
>> It looks like they saw them in the same
rows.

208
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,560
But Geraldine added them two rows at a
time, whereas Joe just went one by one.

209
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,325
So, they're pretty similar.

210
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:49,593
>> What do you mean one by one?

211
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:51,820
>> Joe went one row at a time so 3, 2, 3,
2.

212
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,908
Whereas Geraldine just went 5, 5.

213
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,156
>> Okay, so if we covered this set,

214
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:59,313
we wouldn't have know that they actually
saw those things really differently.

215
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:02,833
>> So, what I'd like you to do now is
write in the forum.

216
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,750
Just a quick response to that dot card
number talk.

217
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,360
What do you think people can gain from
doing a dot card number talk?

218
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,264
Why do you think that they're important to
do?

219
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:11,764
