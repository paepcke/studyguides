1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,640
All of these interventions are
psychological interventions.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,340
They're not about content and they're not
about pedagogy.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,824
But pedagogy and content are extremely
important, and

4
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:13,520
we're going to be thinking about those for
pretty much all of the later sessions.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,544
But just to give you a chance to think
about that a little bit in

6
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:22,300
this first session, there are many things
going wrong in mathematics education.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,090
For me, one of the best short descriptions
of what's going on was written by

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,060
a mathematician called Paul Lockhart.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,426
He was a [INAUDIBLE] is a mathematician
who's also taught maths in K12 schools,

10
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:35,480
and he was so exasperated [INAUDIBLE] by
what he saw in schools.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,080
He wrote something really beautifully
written called A Mathematician's Lament,

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,070
and I'm going to ask you to read some of
that at the end of this class.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,240
So I want to say something first about
teachers.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,606
it, I'm sounding very critical of
mathematics education but

15
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:53,104
I'm not at all critical of teachers
because teachers have had to

16
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:59,052
work in ways that are educationally
damaging for some time.

17
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,930
So I don't blame teachers for the bad
state we're in.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,065
They've been living and working for
decades in a culture driven by

19
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,313
ridiculously long list of content
standards.

20
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:10,277
And those standards made them feel they
have no time to stop and

21
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:13,120
create engaging activities for kids.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,920
And nonstop testing of very narrow content
and multiple choice tests.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,958
There's hope now in the United States with
the onset of the common call that

24
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,190
that's changing.

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,890
On top of that, they've really felt like
their professionalism has stripped away.

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,522
Even when they do take an extra step and

27
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:33,582
do something great, I've heard stories of
administrators coming in and

28
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:36,540
shutting them down, and that's why it's so
important that everybody,

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,210
administrators, parents, teachers, learned
about good mathematics instruction.

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,938
Of course there are great administrators
and teachers who've been able to

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,250
ignore the pressure and done what they
know to be right with the kids.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,425
But that's hard to do with all of the
directives and it happens very rarely.

33
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,380
For me, mathematics is a living act.

34
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,522
It's a performance, a way of interpreting
the world.

35
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:03,370
And we urgently need both to address
stereotypes and myths and

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,102
to bring mathematics back to the real
mathematics.

37
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,950
The mathematicians used and that's out
there in the world.

38
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,462
Teachers, administrators, and

39
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:17,230
parents, all of us can do this, especially
if we work together.

40
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,680
Everyone has a role to play.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,696
And in later sessions we're going to
[INAUDIBLE] learn more about how to

42
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:23,813
do this.

43
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,771
But I'm going to ask you to stop by
reading at least the first five pages of

44
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,350
Lockhart's Lament.

45
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,559
And now, I'll just end by saying that I

46
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,819
look forward to seeing you in the next
session.
