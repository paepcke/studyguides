1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,950
So I want now to tell you

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,500
about some interventions that have been
conducted that have had amazing effects.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,450
And they give us insights into things that
we can all do to counter stereotypes.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,354
So a range of studies have been conducted
by people like Jeff Cohen at Stanford,

5
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:17,140
David Jeiger at the University of Texas,
and their colleagues.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,270
They were all in the references.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,118
The first one I found amazing,

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:25,344
they divided students into two groups in
English high school classrooms.

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:30,030
And everybody got diagnostic feedback on
an essay, which was critical, really good,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,301
but really good feedback.

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:37,944
Half of the students randomly also got a
sentence.

12
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:42,290
Which was this, I am giving you this
feedback because I believe in you.

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,740
The teachers didn't know who got that
sentence.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,872
What they found was those students
achieved significantly better in

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,960
the essay, they made more improvements.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,228
They also achieved significantly better a
year

17
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:57,790
later particularly the black students.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,802
So white students improved, but
African-American students they made

19
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:07,070
significant improvements, from that one
single statement.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,324
So they've looked at praise and feedback
carefully and

21
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:13,790
they've pointed out that, you know, you
can't just over praise students.

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,182
Especially stereotype groups, because that
just makes them perceive that,

23
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:21,890
the a lower standard is being applied to
them and it backfires.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,050
But when these African-American students
are encouraged to see criticism of

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,577
a reflection of two things.

26
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:32,737
Their teachers high standards and their
teachers belief in their potential,

27
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:39,210
their performance in really important
subjects improved in important ways.

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,828
So I'm not suggesting here that we can
just add I believe in you to feedback and

29
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:45,660
everything will be well.

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,681
I'm showing this data as much as anything
to show you how powerful

31
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:51,790
single messages can be that we give to
kids.

32
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,810
And I think that's really important for
teachers and for parents.

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,214
So I'm going to get us to stop now and

34
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:01,620
pause and think about the effect of that
particular intervention.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,310
Why, or how,

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,750
do you think one message, one sentence,
could impact students a year later?
