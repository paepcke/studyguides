00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,711
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,371
So the second piece we're going to think
about is the tasks that are used in

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:08,987
math classrooms or at home.

4
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:11,627
The task chosen for math lessons are
hugely important for

5
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:13,700
the development of mindset.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,873
If they're short and

7
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:21,120
closed with 1 right answer, like most math
questions that are in math classrooms.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,962
And students are constantly either just
getting them right or wrong,

9
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:29,090
then it's really hard to develop the idea
that math is about growth and learning.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,914
And if you're constantly getting them
wrong,

11
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:34,030
it's really hard to believe that you can
really do math.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,974
So instead, many students, just from the
tasks they get, come to believe that math

13
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:44,450
is more about performance and performing,
than it is about learning and growth.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,164
So my colleague Rachel Lambert told me
recently that her son who's six,

15
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:51,120
came home from school one day and said he
hadn't enjoyed his math class.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,585
And when she asked him why, he said, math
is too much answer time and

17
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:57,195
not enough learning time.

18
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,979
And I thought that was really interesting,
that even a six year old got

19
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:03,640
the sense that math classes were not about
space for learning.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,230
Instead they're often about performing.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,580
And the more math classes I visit, the
more I can see that math

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,170
classrooms offer maths more of performance
subject that a learning subject.

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,140
So what do I mean by that?

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,320
A great example of a teacher changing a
problem from one that had

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,340
opportunities really only for performing
to one that was a great invitation for

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,746
learning within the task.

27
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:29,890
I'm going to show you now.

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,570
She didn't use that framing.

29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,100
She talks about letting students own the
task in her adapted version.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,098
But look at the opportunities for growth
and

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,790
learning in the first, in the second
version of her task that we'll see here.

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,046
So the next question for you is, what
ideas did you get

33
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:52,070
about quality growth mindset math tasks in
the posting you just read?
