1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,533
So everybody worked on this, and then we
got everyone to just come up and

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,670
put one of their solutions on the board,
which they were happy to do.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,870
And they became excited.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,810
They were totally engaged by the activity,
which actually is a great one, because it

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,900
practices a number of operations, but it
does that through an enquiry approach.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,974
So that was a low-stress beginning, for
them coming up to the board, and

7
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:20,910
we gradually got them more used to it.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,840
We wanted them to have voice, so we gave
them all blank notebooks.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,960
And we asked them the decorate them, make
them their own.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,610
And that was their place for their
mathematical voice, their ideas.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,030
And we didn't write in their notebooks, as
it was meant to be their place.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,345
But we left feedback for them on post it
notes.

13
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,310
And you can see an example of that here.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,270
We started most days with the number talk
which you know about.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,870
And those just blew the kids away.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,270
They had not known that number problems
could be solved in so many ways.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,964
So our research tells us that students are
much more successful in algebra if

18
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:56,980
they've learned about ways to break
numbers apart, as we talked about.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,620
If they know, for example, that 13 is the
same as 5 plus 8 and

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,335
they're fluent in those ways of thinking
Well, 13 equals 5 plus 8.

21
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:10,490
Then it helps them learn about algebraic
expressions, such as a equals b plus c.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,788
We collected a lot of data to understand
how this different math approach for

23
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:17,630
the students impacted their learning.

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,170
So this is a list of the different data we
collected.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,126
So we had their summer school
applications.

26
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,220
Which had data from their teachers.

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,310
Lesson observations.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,210
All the lessons were observed.

29
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,840
Students completed lots of surveys and
reflections.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,475
We interviewed students.

31
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:38,210
35 during the summer, and 15 in the fall.

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,380
And then we analyzed all their class
materials, posters, work.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,910
What they produced.

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,920
And then we also had results of MARS
assessment.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,065
So, we haven't intended to give a post
test,

36
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:52,140
as these students came from different
grades, different schools.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,650
They hadn't worked on the same things.

38
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,926
But we found out that all students had
taken the MARS assessment at the end of

39
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,270
their previous term.

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,490
That's an assessment that comes from the
Mathematics Assessment Resource Service.

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,216
It's just normal, average, sort of normal
school like test but it's much better and

42
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:11,780
more conceptual than other school math
tests I've seen.

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,880
So the end of five weeks we gave them the
same questions, the algebra questions, and

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,892
the students scored with a 24% increase
which was significant,

45
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:25,240
a significant increase.

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,910
And that was great.

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,934
Or their intention was less to improve
content as to teach them to

48
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:34,320
engage in maths with a positive inquiry
relationship that they could take forward.

49
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,850
So, probably the greatest sign of a change
in engagement during the five weeks for

50
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,210
me was their change in behavior.

51
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,480
At the beginning they shuffled in to the
first class, they had their hoods up.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,060
They sat down.

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,590
They didn't want to talk.

54
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,670
They only were interested in talking about
social issues.

55
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,800
Not maths.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,280
But by the end it was amazing.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,318
They were jostling at the door to get into
the room and then rushing to get at

58
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,140
the problem or the [UNKNOWN] they had
worked on for 90 minutes the previous day.

59
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,190
And continue on with it.

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,820
It was really great.

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,590
So, we saw a couple of surveys from the
first day.

62
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,840
Here a.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,190
Two of the same students giving their
response after the five weeks.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
So we asked, how does this class feel
compared to

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,160
other math classes you've been in?

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
And she said, it's a lot funner and more
interesting.

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,670
And I'm actually learning something about
math.

68
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,509
And we asked, has it been more or less
useful?

69
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,260
And she said more.

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,740
Because, in a regular math class, you have
to do everything the teacher's way.

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,815
And sometimes, I don't get it.

72
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:31,677
And in here, I could do the problems
whatever way I want.

73
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:34,893
And that was super-important to many of
the students,

74
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:39,740
that freedom to work on problems the way
that they wanted to.

75
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,301
And then the,

76
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:45,050
another student saying, this is way better
than any other math class I've been in.

77
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,387
You participate more, and you work
together." So

78
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:51,377
that was interesting because those two
things, participate more and collaborate,

79
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:57,000
were the two biggest things that came out
as powerful for most of the students.

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,480
So one activity we worked on was a famous
activity called the painted cube.

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,490
Here's the activity for you to do.

82
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,706
This is along activity, but if you have
time, stop and

83
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:13,410
work on it now, because it's great.

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,000
And try and describe the function that
come out of this.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,068
You can see, it on a graph, if you want to
plot it on a graph,

86
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:20,200
you'll see that it isn't linear.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,385
And it's kind of exciting to see that
function.

88
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:26,575
So every time I use this problem with
students from seventh grade up to

89
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,380
Stanford freshmen.

90
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,580
They see the problem in many different
ways.

91
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,780
It's really fascinating.

92
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,470
And I can't show you the video of my
seventh and eighth grade students.

93
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,200
But I have some really nice video of my
freshmen class working on this problem,

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,915
which we can look at now.

95
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:40,015
And my question for you is,

96
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:44,730
what features of this problem do you think
enabled the learning that came out?

97
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,615
Which aspects of algebra are being worked
on here?

98
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:51,790
This is like, how we like to work on math
together.

99
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,362
You've been really great at following some
of these norms we developed.

100
00:04:55,362 --> 00:05:01,437
And, the different posters show

101
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:08,492
some of the math problems.

102
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:13,973
[CROSSTALK]

103
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:19,454
[INAUDIBLE]

104
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:26,803
[INAUDIBLE]
>> What?

105
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:29,130
I know.

106
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,812
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> And so we'll be

107
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:41,228
having more/g.

00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:48,032
>> [LAUGH]

109
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:53,876
[BLANK_AUDIO]

110
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:54,808
,

111
00:05:54,808 --> 00:06:03,342
[SOUND]
, [INAUDIBLE].

112
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:07,424
[BLANK_AUDIO]

113
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:13,704
And, we found that there

114
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:20,926
was the same equations that

115
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:30,450
you guys all found.

116
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,884
But then Joe came by and asked us to
explain how we got our center cube.

117
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:37,837
And Alonna, Alonna didn't really, like, do
a good job of explaining, so

118
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:41,254
like, if you imagine this is a three by
three cube sugar block,

119
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:45,292
she said that you would knock off.

120
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:48,987
>> Faces, until you are left with a cube
inside.

121
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,430
>> It sort of goes with the onion thing.

122
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,690
Like, if you have let's say, a four by
four cube.

123
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,798
I'm going to take off this slice, this
slice, a slice from the top,

124
00:06:57,798 --> 00:07:02,960
a slice from the bottom, and a slice from
each side.

125
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,690
And then on the inside, there's a cube
left.

126
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,548
I don't know.

127
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,260
It, it's hard to show.

128
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,500
>> [UNKNOWN]
>> Yeah, I just made this as a visual way

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,350
to represent it.

130
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,470
And to show all the different, types of
cubes that are represented.

131
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,561
And so, like, this is one way.

132
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:26,851
Layer.
This is two layers and

133
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,251
this is three layers.

134
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,875
But you can see like even the cubes on the
inside.

135
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:35,428
And so this, this would be like the cube
that doesn't have any sides painted.

136
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:40,164
And then these would be the eight corners
that, that have three sides painted.

137
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:44,380
These would be the faces that have one
sides painted, one side painted, and

138
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,236
then the pink would be the two sides
painted, and so

139
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:52,204
it's just, like, representing 3D on a 2D
space.

140
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:52,806
>> Mhm.

141
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,225
And just to help with visual,
visualization,.

142
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,140
The computer really helps.

143
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,686
This is.
So

144
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:04,641
this is just a demonstration using
mathematical [UNKNOWN].

145
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:10,023
and, so this a 2 by 2 by 2 and it's pretty
transparent so you can see the corners.

146
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:14,340
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

147
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,175
Looking at the corners, you can count the
faces.

148
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,293
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

149
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:21,965
There's a face on the bottom and it's
helpful to see that those

150
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:26,929
properties really don't change, you know,
then number of faces is staying the same,

151
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:32,975
even as I increase the number of number of
total cubes.

152
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:36,111
So the number of corners is going to be
constant, the number of faces is

153
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:41,165
going to be constant, and even the number
of edges is going to be constant.

154
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:46,889
It also helps in visualizing the, the idea
that there's a an inside cube.

155
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:49,323
So.
>> Yeah, so,

156
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:58,633
this isn't quite accurate then I guess.

157
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,127
yeah, okay I'm confused about,

158
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,816
about the drawing [LAUGH]

159
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:07,727
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] But it really helped you.

160
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,998
>> Yeah, but, but the drawing helped us to
visualize it.

161
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:14,838
>> Okay so don't, try not to repeat things
other people have said,

162
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:22,308
see if you can add something different or
different ways of seeing it?

163
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,262
>> Okay.
So first, we did like the 3 by 3,

164
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:27,690
and then we wrote what we found there.

165
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,411
And then, we did the 4 by 4 but we didn't
actually have enough like cubes, so

166
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,436
sad day for us.

167
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:34,477
>> [LAUGH]
>> So we actually like,

168
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,220
we didn't count things.

169
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,780
We had to like find patterns, and so once
we started like Like, how we saw?

170
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,433
Yeah, okay.

171
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:50,118
So, like, for the three by three, we had
six, one color, and then 24 for the four.

172
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:53,772
So, we actually found that it was 6 times
1, and then 6 times 4, is how we got it,

173
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:59,260
because you have, for the one color, these
are the ones that like.

174
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,070
Are just in the middle of the face.

175
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,670
So like here, you got like no color face.

176
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,142
And so like we're looking for the middle
because you

177
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:18,851
can't count the edges cause we just want
the middle of the face.

178
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:27,181
So it's a defining area, that's going to
be this times that.

179
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,912
So, you have five, right, and then because
you can't count this row or

180
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:36,780
this row, it'll be five minus two.

181
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,299
And then, same thing up here, so you have
five.

182
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,530
And then you can count this or this, and
then that's going to

183
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:57,419
be 5 minus 2 then, so it's just going to
be n minus 2 square.

184
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,944
[CROSSTALK] [CROSSTALK] So,

185
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:07,545
I think we should describe how like the
inside, just slicing off a layer.

186
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:12,325
>> I agree.

187
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:14,238
Like [INAUDIBLE].

188
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:18,054
>> Yeah.

189
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,866
[INAUDIBLE]

190
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:27,740
>> I don't know because, I think, if we go
up one more.

191
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,855
>> Mm-mmm
>> This relationship..

192
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:36,551
>> [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah, yeah, I don't, I
not quite sure how to put this...

193
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:37,247
[CROSSTALK]

194
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:40,352
>> But, if, yeah, this, like if we, if we
use a basic...

195
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,298
>> of two.
>> Mm-hmm.

196
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:45,546
>> This represents, like, two to the zero,
two to the one, two squared, and

197
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:49,301
two cubed, the amount it changes by.

198
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,308
>> Yeah.

199
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:56,633
>> And so, and I figure, like, there's
some blank coefficient times,

200
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,693
in [SOUND]
>> Square the nq.

201
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:04,840
The n to the first.

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,878
Or n to the zero.

203
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:06,488
>> Mm-hm.

204
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,845
>> And I'm trying to find the coefficient
for each one of these.

205
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:09,460
>> Got it.
Hmm.

206
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,899
>> Yeah.
I don't know if that,

207
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,062
like makes any sense.

208
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,533
[CROSSTALK]
>> [UNKNOWN] Just to do a,

209
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,561
like, number five?

210
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,453
Yeah, and then again.

211
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:34,020
>> Now two, this one likes works.

212
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,710
>> You know this one is A right,

213
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,877
>> Yeah Are we doing five?

214
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:53,456
>> Given the cube with N sides we'll have
two exposed, three exposed.

215
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,990
The side is zero.

216
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,126
>> The two is so hard though because they
are all overlapping.

217
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,734
>> Well two is just, I'm good But

218
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:08,025
I think the rules also, kind of turn into
like the general [INAUDIBLE].

219
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,400
>> I didn't do that.

220
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,400
But I didn't, I didn't that way round,
cause others abusing [INAUDIBLE].

221
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,040
>> [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK].
>> No, you, four separate rules are fine,

222
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:29,270
you just want know how to find, like each
color.

223
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,101
>> Yeah.

224
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,899
or any given cube.

225
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,969
So you can have two.

226
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:46,107
Do you want to switch seats right now?

227
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:50,230
>> and minus two times six.

228
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,590
Yeah, And three exposed.

229
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:02,086
>> I'm so glad you left it because I
didn't have mine and I thought oh.

230
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,678
>> Which one is that?

231
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:09,766
Well it's like N, but I feel like you can

232
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:15,331
make this formula a lot of different ways,

233
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:25,310
but I feel like N over two, so that's
eight.

234
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,028
Or it's just n times 6.

235
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:34,650
Because so here it's a [CROSSTALK]
>> That's 12, right?

236
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,550
Or is it just N times four?

237
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,165
>> They're right here.

238
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:42,666
>> One. [INAUDIBLE] >> So, I dunno if this
makes sense but

239
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:50,605
does N minus two, times four, times three,
work?

240
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,005
>> Wait, five cubed, what's five cubed?

241
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:52,831
125, right?

242
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:53,736
>> So that would be two.

243
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,003
>> So that would be 25 times 5.

244
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:56,010
>> That does work.

245
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,762
Why does that work?

246
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,490
>> Yeah.

247
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,905
[CROSSTALK]
>> Because so there two.

248
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,145
>> Where'd you get the three from.

249
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:01,690
>> The three?

250
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,053
Because, the way we did it was like, we
added, we took one whole.

251
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,048
>> The three faces.

252
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:06,982
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

253
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:09,630
>> Yeah.
>> And then four, where's the, four?

254
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,945
Because there's four different things.

255
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,542
>> Yeah, four different things.

256
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,180
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.

257
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,708
[CROSSTALK]
>> Oh, 3, 8.

258
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:19,604
>> We should try it with 5 afterwards,
because -- there should be 69 ones with 2.

259
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:20,132
So --

260
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,948
>> What do you mean we should try it with
5?

261
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:26,116
>> I think you guys -- like if we come up
with a formula for

262
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:30,428
the one -- the final ones with 2 --
>> Mm-hmm.

263
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:34,078
>> -- we could try it -- like -- you can
probably narrow it down to

264
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,162
like there has to be 69.

265
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:38,046
>> Like basically, all the...

266
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,298
>> There is?
>> ...other stuff in there, like for

267
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:40,003
five, right?

268
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,744
>> There has to be 69 what?

269
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:42,290
>> Ones with two.

270
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,150
For five, and just basically all the other
stuff we know, like,

271
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,081
there has to be eight, there has to be...

272
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,300
>> Three times twelve.

273
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,610
Wouldn't that be...wait.

274
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,740
Where'd you, I'm just confused.

275
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,832
Where did you get the 69?

276
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:53,732
>> Oh, okay.
So...

277
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:55,675
>> because for two, we got the formula,
and

278
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,697
minus 2 times 4 times

279
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:58,311
>> Mhm
>> Yeah.

280
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,392
Oh for [INAUDIBLE].
I don't know like, it seems like, like,

281
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,330
we can like figure out all the other
things and

282
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,671
then figure out what the two would be for
five.

283
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:10,835
'Cuz like we came up with stuff for all
the others right?

284
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,313
>> Right
>> Maybe I did this wrong.

285
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,773
So like, for five.

286
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,455
There's going to be
