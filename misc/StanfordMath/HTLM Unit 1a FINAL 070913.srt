00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:05,572
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,138
Welcome to the first class of How to Learn
Maths.

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,583
This course is for teachers, parents,
administrators, anyone who teaches or

4
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,580
helps people learn maths.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,040
But, a similar course is going to be
released for students in this school year.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,330
Probably in the fall.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,380
Or just after the winter break.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,120
The version you'll take is no where near
as polished or uh,zappy.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,984
The student version is going to have some
different cool animations and graphics and

10
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:31,176
different ways to engage the
students,different questions and

11
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,640
interviews and so on.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,640
But the idea's are going to be similar.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,630
But I want to introduce you first to those
ideas.

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,650
So, who am I at this point we have over
20,000 people enrolled in the course and

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,310
I know some of you know me well, some have
read my book or researched book or

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,523
researched work.

17
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,983
And many probably most of you have no idea
who I am,

18
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:59,130
so I am a professor of mathematics
education at Stanford University.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,020
But before being a professor and

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,350
during that time, I've taught mathematics
or maths as we call it in the UK.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,094
You'll probably here me say both maths and
math in this course.

22
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,440
And I've taught maths at many different
levels.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,370
So in inner city London and public schools
I taught.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,098
The age range of ages 11 to 18 as we do in
England and

25
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:24,074
I taught in Camden town for those of you
who know the area in

26
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:29,920
schools with more than 250 different
languages spoken.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,000
In the US I've taught math to seventh and
eighth grade students and

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,230
also to undergraduates at Stanford so.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,020
Lots of levels of maths.

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,417
So I've said that this course is for
teachers and for parents,

31
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,331
that's because it's not a course on how to
teach with the detailed ideas for

32
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:46,700
teaching, although there are some of
those.

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,540
But it's really a course with short input
from me.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,470
Most sessions are about 15 or 20 minutes
long.

35
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,020
I think I said in the description they'd
be 10 to 15 minutes but

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,174
I got a bit excited about the different
ideas I could show you.

37
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:03,725
And so I'm going to show you some research
ideas that have recently emerged that

38
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,960
I think can be really helpful for
everybody.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,180
So this course is somewhat experimental.

40
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,660
You're my first time of trying this and
we're in it together.

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,244
I, I would welcome input on what is or
isn't useful for you as well as letting me

42
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:22,002
know in the forum Which of the ideas will
be most useful for the student course.

43
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,220
Which is the one I'll work on next.

44
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,996
I'd really like us to be a community of
learners in the intro video that you can

45
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,769
see on how the course works, tells you
about the forum and

46
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,430
the other places we can connect.

47
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,370
And there's going to be some life chat
sessions, too.

48
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,444
So it's hard to design a class for such a
broad range of people but

49
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:43,286
my hope is that even if I give you one or
two key ideas they can

50
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:46,940
change something you do in the classroom
or an interaction you can have with

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,304
your own children that may actually make a
huge difference for them in

52
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:59,080
their mathematical trajectory as your find
out from the ideas I'll show you.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,313
I'm going to be helped in teaching this
course by some really interesting

54
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,387
individuals who I interviewed for the
course, and they're going to be

55
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:11,160
sharing their experiences of using maths
out in the world and of learning maths.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,770
So we have Michelle Sandburg, who's a
pediatrician.

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,640
Sebastian Thrun who designed the
self-driving cars for Google.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,030
He's also a Stanford professor and the CEO
of Udacity, an online company.

59
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,510
Chris who's a software engineer at
Udacity.

60
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,850
Emily is a team leader at Apple.

61
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,970
She leads a team of engineers.

62
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,200
And Sophie is a filmmaker.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,210
And they're going to come in and out of
the course, as you'll see.

64
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,390
I also included Carol Dweck who's the guru
on mindsets.

65
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,750
And you'll be seeing some of her.

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,834
So, it would really help me in moving
forward if I can collect some data from

67
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,530
you, about who you are your motives for
taking the course.

68
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,390
I'm going to ask you, now, to stop and

69
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,795
complete the survey, that I'll direct you
to.

70
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,459
And this survey is really important so

71
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,810
I would really appreciate if you would
complete this.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,148
So teaching is really complex and

73
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:12,220
intellectual work even though people often
don't think that.

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,904
If you think about, just for a moment,
what happens when you're in a whole,

75
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,241
when a teacher's in a whole class
discussion.

76
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,557
And the student asks a question or

77
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:24,100
says something and the teacher needs to
come back with a comment or a question.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,648
In that moment they have to hear what the
students have said and

79
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,657
make sense of that in terms of their
thinking, and

80
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:33,580
think about what their mathematical
trajectory is, what's helpful for them.

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,883
At the same time thinking about the
journey of the class and

82
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:38,940
where they are and what they need to hear.

83
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,643
And in that split second they have to make
those decisions and

84
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:45,250
come back with a question or a response
for a student.

85
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,065
That is a very, very hard thing to do, and

86
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,830
teaching is one of the hardest jobs in the
world.

87
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,575
It's also one of the most important, and
what we now know is that small moments,

88
00:04:55,575 --> 00:05:02,535
small conversations and messages to
students can make a huge, huge difference.

89
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,180
And I'm going to come to those, some of
those, in a moment.

90
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,687
But first I want us to look together at
some data.

91
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:12,286
I want to share with you now some data
that I learned in this past year and I,

92
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,790
I was pretty shocked by.

93
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,992
And that's this, currently in the US 50%
of students are in 2 year colleges.

94
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:26,760
70% of those students are placed into
remedial maths classes.

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,770
Basically, repeating the maths they took
in high school.

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,393
And only 1 in 10 students complete those
courses for

97
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,650
the other 90%, they actually leave
college.

98
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,290
That, they don't get through that math
course and

99
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,210
that's the end of their college career.

100
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,476
So that data is, I thin pretty shocking
and

101
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,635
it tells you about the wide spread
problem.

102
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:49,397
And I want you to think now about what do
you think is the top reason for

103
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:54,006
that problem, and I've just put four
reasons down.

104
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,034
This I'm going to get you to just choose
one, or

105
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:59,000
you can choose more than one from the
list.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,535
So this is your first question, that's
actually a multiple-choice question,

107
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:05,720
even though there aren't going to be many
multiple choice questions at all in here.

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,610
But this one works for that.

109
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,684
So I want you to just look at the choices,
pick as many as you like,

110
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:14,350
trying, you know, trying to make it 1 or
2.

111
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,670
Why you think there's such a terrible
problem in mathematics education?

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,140
There's so many students end their career
with maths.

113
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,480
So is it the teaching methods that are
taught in schools and colleges?

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,714
Maybe you think students lack foundational
knowledge that trips them up, maybe you

115
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:36,716
think students don't have the ability for
that high level maths or perhaps Algebra

116
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:42,920
is the stumbling block, its just a very
difficult subject for many.

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,580
So, choose from those.
