[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:08,363
Hello, and welcome to the last class.

3
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:11,410
So, in this session, I want to review
where we've been.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,250
And think about what could be really
helpful for

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,370
you in your journey onwards from this
class.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,910
We also have a few ideas to think about
and some great videos.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,990
So, first, I want us to think a little bit
about geometry.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,750
Because we spent a whole session on
algebra, and

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,810
we both thought a lot about numbers.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,226
This is going to be very small, but I
really wanted you to hear a little from

11
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:34,586
Sophie and Sebastian as they both talk
about geometry in their lives and

12
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:39,170
work, and they're both very interesting.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,353
So, after each one, after hearing Sophie
and

14
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:46,161
Sebastian, I would like you to write a
short, two sentence reflection.

15
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,701
What does this prompt you to think about
in terms of geometry teaching in

16
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,645
school and how it could be better?

17
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:58,610
>> I don't know why geometry didn't work
for me.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,640
I mean, it, for some reason, it was,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,200
I guess it was more abstract than anything
I'd ever done before.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,880
And even the equations of algebra still,
they still seemed accessible,

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,057
whereas geometry sort of, it was like you
had to suspend your notions of reality.

22
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:22,530
Because there were no, there's no such
thing as you know, perfect sphere, or

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,780
you know, something, something.

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,350
>> Yeah.
>> So, it was not, and

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,600
there was nothing, there was nothing
grounded in geometry.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,250
It was these abstract notions, and, and it
was so, [LAUGH] so

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,420
easy to space out, right?

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,078
I don't know where I'm going with this.

29
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,028
so, which I you know, that sort of is a
good segway.

30
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:50,079
I mean that the abstraction of geometry
made no sense to me.

31
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,185
And that was my great ah-ha in life, where
suddenly I saw real geometric expressions,

32
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:01,010
in the real world, you know, in my work.

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,267
So, you know, I'm a, I'm a film-maker, and

34
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:07,293
I went through a process of [UNKNOWN] of
working my way up through the ranks, and

35
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,815
I was a camera assistant for a period of
time.

36
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:14,293
And as a focus puller, it's your, your job
is to, to,

37
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:18,015
to figure out the distances between here
and there.

38
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,375
And then if a person walks, or you're on a
dolly or

39
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:25,100
a crane, you have to figure out what the,
how that distance changes.

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,381
With all these sort of geometrical
maneuvers [CROSSTALK].

41
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:32,257
Really mathematical, and of course you you
don't get to take your tape measure out

42
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:37,170
while you're shooting or while you're on
this crane or this dolly.

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,690
So, you know, you sort of have to use
intuition, but

44
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,870
you also you know, you can start doing
quick math in your head and

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,575
go uh-huh, uh-huh the isosceles triangle
[INAUDIBLE].

46
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,735
And I knew all that math, and I had
studied it, and

47
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:53,880
it was it was, it was somewhere deep in my
brain.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,050
But suddenly I was like, ooh yeah, yeah, I
know where we are.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,870
I know how close we are to that next
number.

50
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,820
Or that you're going to go far then close
based on this sort of, this parabola.

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,270
And, and to me that was so exciting.

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,662
But I was like, why didn't somebody take
me to a film set when I was 15, and show,

53
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:16,035
show me this we, you know, and there's
something sexy about a camera, and lights.

54
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:20,150
And you know, this, this equipment, and
that, that was, that was fun, right?

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,870
That was really, that was geometry in its,
in its best.
