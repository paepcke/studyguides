00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:06,002
[MUSIC].

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,103
Hello and welcome to our fourth session.

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:11,177
This one's going to be a little longer
with about 20 minutes from me and

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,390
also some videos to watch.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,420
And some lessons for you to look at.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,730
So allow yourself plenty of time.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,130
Because this session is really going to
discuss some particular strategies that

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,180
teachers and parents and

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,220
others can use to promote a growth mindset
in their students.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,118
So I've shown you data already,

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,684
showing the impact of a growth mindset
intervention for students.

12
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:36,897
And those interventions are available at
mindset works, and

13
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:39,633
this is the web address for that.

14
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,287
But the effect of such interventions won't
last if students return to

15
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:48,890
math classrooms where they're bombarded
with fixed mindset messages.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,256
I've been approached by school principals
who tell me that their teachers have

17
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,288
read Carol Dweck's books.

18
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:59,090
They love the ideas, but they don't know
what it means for their math teaching.

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,714
Well, it means a lot for maths teaching,
because it's teachers and parents who can

20
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:10,070
really make a difference and change
students from a fixed to growth mindset.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,838
Just to illustrate the power of parents,

22
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,906
Carol Dweck told me the other day that she
got a letter from the parent of

23
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:19,795
a boy who'd been asked in class to write
down what he was smart at.

24
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:23,279
And instead of answering that question, he
wrote that he really couldn't answer

25
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:28,790
the question because everything he was
good at, he worked really hard for.

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,330
That's the child of a parent giving him
growth mindset messages despite

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,270
the messages he gets in school.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,113
Teachers are also extremely powerful in
the mindset students develop as

29
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:43,120
they communicate messages about mindset
constantly.

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,088
So messages come from grouping structures,
from the tasks students work on,

31
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,880
from assessment and grading.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,740
The way mistakes are managed, the norm set
in a classroom.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,820
And I want to thank my two graduate
students Sarah Kate Selling and

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,852
Kathy Sun for the ideas I'm going to show
you now, which we've developed together as

35
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:05,725
ways of helping teachers and others
develop a growth mindset in students.

36
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:12,157
So this picture shows you the different
areas that are going to be worked on.

37
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:16,080
We've already talked in the last lesson
about mistakes.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
And they're a big part of a growth mindset
culture.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,476
But here are some ideas for

40
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:25,680
the rest of this session about the other
aspects that we featured in that picture.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,205
[MUSIC]

42
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:31,080
So the first one I want to talk about is
the norms that is set in the classrooms or

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,491
around homework at home.

44
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,863
And the norms that teachers set up or the
parents establish around what math is and

45
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:44,281
how we work on math is super important.

46
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:50,270
And it's really important to set up norms
that are all about a growth mindset.

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,966
So instead of talking a lot about this,

48
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:55,910
we've already talked about a lot of the
ideas in the last session.

49
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,980
Instead, I want to show you a video of one
amazing teacher.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,440
So Cathy Humphreys is the teacher.

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,861
And she and I wrote a book together,

52
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:08,054
that includes lots of great examples of
her teaching in middle school.

53
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:14,170
And in the book there are lesson plans,
she, she shows her lesson plans.

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,660
She talks about how she was thinking about
the lesson.

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,130
She, then, reflects on the lesson.

56
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,445
And Many teachers have found it very
helpful to watch these teaching examples

57
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:24,440
and read Cathy's thoughts.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,800
So, Cathy has a really strong focus in her
classroom on a particular norm

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,600
that's about encouraging students to be
sense makers.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,325
Nothing goes in her classroom unless the
students can make sense of it.

61
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:40,490
So there are different things within.

62
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,358
The norm of sense making.

63
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:46,040
She encourages different ways to make
sense.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,285
We have different representations,
encouraging students to draw and

65
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:53,360
to visualize and to show things in
different ways.

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,779
She also develops a culture of
collaboration and shared work.

67
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,350
Students really make sense of mathematics
when they talk about it.

68
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,970
And when they reason mathematically with
each other.

69
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,330
Something else she does, is she gives
public space to the sense making norms.

70
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,940
So she holds whole class discussions.

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,768
Now, when teachers have those whole class
discussions, it's chance for them to

72
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,150
really instantiate norms of what they
think is important with all the students.

73
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,475
What math is and what's important in the
class.

74
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,389
And Maggie Lambert wrote about that in,

75
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,660
in her book which I put in the reference
section.

76
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,579
So, in Cathy's class, mistakes are really
valued and shared for

77
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:41,672
everyone to think about and this is an
extract from Cathy's writing in the book.

78
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:45,598
[BLANK_AUDIO]

79
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:51,034
So I'm going to ask you to

80
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:57,074
watch the video now, and

81
00:04:57,074 --> 00:05:03,114
afterwards I'm going to

82
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:10,060
ask you to write in the forum

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,610
what teacher moves did you and

84
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,858
find interesting that Cathy

85
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:32,408
used to support the students'

86
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:39,656
learning in this ten-minute

87
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:49,656
time.

88
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:59,200
>> What would this one be?

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,316
[SOUND] Without, without doing a role that
you know,

90
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:11,710
like, see if you can make sense of
[INAUDIBLE] what one,

91
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:20,084
one divided by two [CROSSTALK]
[INAUDIBLE].

92
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:26,671
>> What's one and a half [CROSSTALK]
[INAUDIBLE].

93
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:32,941
>> It's one and a half [CROSSTALK]
[INAUDIBLE] makes sense.

94
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,562
[CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] Hi, let's hear
what some people have to say.

95
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,150
Leslie.

96
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,404
>> [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.
Say what you think it is.

97
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:58,776
>> I think it's six.

98
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:01,324
>> And you think it's six because?

99
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:04,858
>> Because a third goes into one three
times, and

100
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:09,105
then three times has to do with it.

101
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:16,370
>> Alright other thoughts about this?

102
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,185
[UNKNOWN].

103
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:20,995
>> I got one and a half.

104
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,020
[SOUND] [INAUDIBLE] of two.

105
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,482
>> I can't hear.

106
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:31,220
>> I got one and a half because I
[INAUDIBLE].

107
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,572
>> You, you used the reciprocal of three
half, of two thirds.

108
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,933
>> Yeah.

109
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,124
>> Why?

110
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:46,401
>> Because on the other one, we could
[INAUDIBLE].

111
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,584
>> Yeah, and so see what's, what, here's
what I,

112
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:51,484
here's where I'm going with this today.

113
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:54,193
But before classing, you're going to have
a rule.

114
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:58,962
And some people already know the rule, but
I don't care about the rule right now.

115
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:01,510
What I want to know is can anybody make
sense of this, of what,

116
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,580
alright, let's just, so right now we have
two different answers.

117
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,238
We have the answer six, and Lesley is
saying it's because you divide it,

118
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,110
there's three one thirds in one.

119
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,635
And then, 2 times 3 is 6.

120
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:21,640
And then we have the other theory, that
the [INAUDIBLE] get your hands down.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,268
The other theory that the answer's one and
a half, but

122
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,210
we don't know why, except that the rule
works.

123
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,345
So the rule working is not good enough
today.

124
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:28,876
Alright.

125
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,601
So why does it make sense?

126
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,990
What?
Does Leslie's answer make sense?

127
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,682
What?
Does one and a half make sense?

128
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:40,796
I want to know why it makes sense.

129
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:41,536
[SOUND] Okay.

130
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:44,840
I've got almost one hand up in every
group, but not quite.

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,877
I want every group to come up with what
makes sense, some reason why.

132
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:52,344
[CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] Put those heads
together.

133
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:58,089
>> [CROSSTALK] 2 3rds [INAUDIBLE] and half
of 2 3rds is one 3rd.

134
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:06,469
2 3rds plus 1 3rd is 3 3rds is 1.

135
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,864
Right?

136
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,698
>> [INAUDIBLE] [NOISE] [CROSSTALK]
[INAUDIBLE] Excuse me.

137
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:13,125
This is really interesting.

138
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:19,680
The side of the room that I talked to,
about half of the people thought

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:29,320
it was six, and about half the people
thought it was one and a half.

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,534
And then, I found Sam willing to make an
argument for one half.

141
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,974
So Sam would you go to the board and draw
a picture?

142
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,975
And you can erase the other pictures so
far.

143
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:48,115
[NOISE] And would you erase the other
arithmetic

144
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:57,223
too, so we start [INAUDIBLE] any problem?

145
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:00,644
>> [SOUND] [COUGH].

146
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:05,096
>> Well if you have, if you have this,

147
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:11,210
that's, it's not even clear.

148
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,591
That's, if that's one whole.

149
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:20,056
And if these, [SOUND] if these two parts
are shaded, then, that's two thirds.

150
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:20,750
Right?

151
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,086
That and this one doesn't count now, so

152
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:27,374
that's two thirds and this is the other
one third.

153
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:30,338
And so if you draw, this is a whole.

154
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,992
[INAUDIBLE].
See that's the whole right?

155
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:37,853
And if you change these two, put them here
[SOUND] like it was.

156
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:43,177
And then you still have these, and you
still have the 1 3rd left.

157
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:48,385
And 1 3rd is half of 2 3rds, and so you
just add one half.

158
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:50,337
And that's what I was thinking.

159
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,697
>> Now, remember what the day that we
talked about,

160
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:57,200
convince yourself, convince a friend, you
convince a skeptic.

161
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,532
Anybody want to [INAUDIBLE] let's see if
anybody can

162
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:09,800
challenge Sam or push on his thinking a
little bit.

163
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
>> Okay.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,528
>> I thought you were, okay well that's
exactly what I was thinking.

165
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:19,000
And that's how I convinced our table to
get a couple people here

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,184
[INAUDIBLE] thought it was six, and then I
pretty much convinced them [INAUDIBLE].

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,515
>> Zack or Ben I need one of you to talk
about what Michael might have said that

168
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,806
convinced you?

169
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,010
>> [COUGH] Everything.

170
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,332
>> One and a half [INAUDIBLE] the
beginning.

171
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,632
>> [CROSSTALK] He was discovering.

172
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,034
>> You are the skeptic?

173
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,580
Okay, now really, this would be really
great.

174
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,387
What made you change your mind?

175
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,946
>> It made more sense to me than 4.

176
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,386
>> Can you explain it?

177
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:49,154
>> I think so.

178
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:51,170
>> Okay, would you try, please?

179
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,705
because if you can explain what somebody
else said,

180
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:58,642
then you're one notch further up in your
ability to understand it.

181
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:04,362
Well, there's 2 3rds, and 2 3rds goes into
one, one whole time with,

182
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:13,251
and there's still a little half left over,
or a little 1 3rd left over.

183
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,971
And so you try to fit it in there
[INAUDIBLE].

184
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,819
So one half of it fits.

185
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,345
So, [INAUDIBLE] one and one half times.

186
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:27,628
>> Anyone, one, want to comment to Ben?

187
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:31,906
>> Well yeah, I agree with you and Sammy
and Michael.

188
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:38,001
>> So I just thought of it line/g
[INAUDIBLE] where [INAUDIBLE] like mine.

189
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:41,012
>> Could you show your line [INAUDIBLE]?

190
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,800
So, the more ways we have it, then we're
going to have to hear from the six people

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:53,430
because there's gotta be maybe some people
still that are thinking the answer is 6.

192
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,460
>> [SOUND] [INAUDIBLE] One, then, okay, so
right here is our 2 3rds mark.

193
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,593
And, and so, so from like here to here, it
goes through that one time,

194
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:06,469
one full time like Ben said.

195
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,580
So that's like, certainty of one.

196
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,468
And then here is 1 3rd left and

197
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:19,825
1 3rd [SOUND] is one half of 2 3rds.

198
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:25,847
So, times 2 3rds equals [INAUDIBLE] two,
oh wait.

199
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:30,314
>> 1 3rd or 2 3rds.

200
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:34,758
>> Well, well, 1 3rd is a half of 2 3rds.

201
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:41,314
>> How would you write that, one minus one
half of 2 3rds?

202
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,250
>> I think [SOUND] I would write
[CROSSTALK] 2

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,946
3rds divided by [CROSSTALK] I'm not sure
[INAUDIBLE].

204
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:48,176
>> Maybe you could get help from someone
in the class.

205
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,116
>> Oh I can?

206
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,429
So, hey Sheryl.

207
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,380
>> 2 3rds, you write 2 3rds times one
half.

208
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:02,033
>> [INAUDIBLE] Then you get one
[INAUDIBLE] [SOUND] Um, [INAUDIBLE].

209
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:11,470
So, then, that 2 6th is also equal to 1
3rd, and that's that part, 1 3rd.

210
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,972
So that 1 3rd is like a half of the 2
3rds, so

211
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:20,468
then you can consider it one and a half.

212
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:23,405
>> Sheryl?

213
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,933
>> I have another way of thinking, like as
in the number [INAUDIBLE] say.

214
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,802
>> You can go up.

215
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:35,126
>> Okay, so the problem is one

216
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:44,400
divided by 2 3rds equals blank.

217
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,016
And then, also, you know how you go the
inverse.

218
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,752
So you can go either way.

219
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:58,656
So then you can do this times 2 3rds
equals one.

220
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:02,828
And so, that is going to be 3 over 2,

221
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:08,668
which is also one and a half.

222
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:11,641
>> Why does that make sense?

223
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:17,608
Or does it make sense?

224
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,968
>> I don't, I don't really understand,
like, to me it's like,

225
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,075
I still think it's 6 because.

226
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,178
>> Wait, Christine.

227
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:28,194
And I know you had your hand up and I, I
want to call on you about why it's 6,

228
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:32,167
but this, what method is Sheryl using
here, for this one?

229
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,534
Okay.

230
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,802
Since people aren't remembering,
[INAUDIBLE] remember when yesterday we

231
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,490
talked about that fan that before we
[UNKNOWN] number sentences?

232
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,492
Can anybody, well, okay, and so

233
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:48,130
you chose another number sentence to show
what that would be true?

234
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,807
Okay.

235
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,040
Christine, and you still think it's 6?

236
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,851
>> Yeah, because me and Alisha kind of has
the same method iii.

237
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,944
>> You and who have the same answer?

238
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:57,764
>> Alisha.

239
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:58,420
>> Okay.

240
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,512
>> And like, we [LAUGH] we multiplied the
numerator by the denominator and

241
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:08,730
then multiplied that by the whole number,
which equals, because 2 times 3 equals 6.

242
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,261
>> [CROSSTALK] Could you go up and show
what you did?

243
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,622
[SOUND] Is this the kind of problem you
had two different answers to?

244
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,738
>> No, no.
>> Some problems could have more than one

245
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:21,203
answer or a range of answers, but in this
case we agree that there has to be, so

246
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:27,922
the question is which, which is the most
sensible way of interpreting this problem.

247
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:37,739
>> 2 times 3 equals 6 [SOUND] and 6 times
1 equals 6.

248
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:44,571
>> And why does that make sense, Christie?

249
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,120
>> I don't, [LAUGH].

250
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,020
>> Leslie, what do you think about.

251
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,684
>> Well.
>> What do

252
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:52,060
you think about our original answer?

253
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,200
>> I thought it was 6.

254
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,012
But then I don't think it could be that
big.

255
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:58,520
>> [LAUGH] Why don't you think it could be
that big?

256
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,332
>> Well, because you're doing 1 divided by
2 3rds.

257
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,366
And it'd be less than 6.

258
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,102
I don't know any other way to do it.

259
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,586
>> So you're trying to figure out and

260
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:09,124
you're trying to figure out something to
do with numbers?

261
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:11,604
>> Yeah, I was thinking about Cheryl's
method.

262
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:14,724
I, I don't really understand it that much
but like I kind of was looking at it and

263
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:16,564
it makes sense now.

264
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:18,020
>> Okay.
You've got two people who

265
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,284
are just about having a fit over here.

266
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,955
Would you call on a few people?

267
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:25,320
>> Amy?
>> Well if you multiply 6 by 2 3rds,

268
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,746
it wouldn't equal 1.

269
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,830
>> Oh, you're checking.

270
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,490
>> Yeah.

271
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,625
>> The inverse operation.

272
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,781
[INAUDIBLE] You know,

273
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:43,195
how you wrote two times three [INAUDIBLE]
because the line means divide.

274
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,500
So it would be 2 divided [INAUDIBLE].

275
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,788
>> [INAUDIBLE] Okay, so the, the line
separating [INAUDIBLE].

276
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:53,204
>> Okay, so I'm going to stop this right
now because here's something that really,

277
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:56,792
I think, is the biggest danger in math is
that you follow rules,

278
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:03,660
you do things with numbers, it's kind of
like waving your magic wand.

279
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,997
>> As much [UNKNOWN] I say about cartoons
like that.

280
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:10,596
Where this mathematician is doing
something on the board and there's all

281
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:16,010
this things that he's done and then in the
middle, let's see, how does it go.

282
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,048
In the middle there's this thing where you
kind of wave your magic wand, and

283
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,348
that way you prove your answer.

284
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:23,608
But, so that's what I don't want you to
do.

285
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,172
I want you to make sense of it.

286
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:29,390
And I want to back to what Lesley said
about how 6 is too big to be sensible.

287
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,545
So let's see what would be a situation
that would, this would make sense?

288
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,590
2 3rds is kind of hard.

289
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,697
Let's see.

290
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:41,390
I have a yard, oh gosh, let's see.

291
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,690
I have a foot of lumber, and I need to cut
off 2 3rds of it.

292
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,545
I need to cut my lumber into 2 3rds of a
foot sections.

293
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:58,040
So how may 2 3rds of a foot sections will
I be able to get out of there?

294
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,030
So if you visualize that piece of lumber,
I cut off the 2 3rds of a foot,

295
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,270
how much I've got left is at [INAUDIBLE]
makes sense then.

296
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,250
>> Now, so it could be six, [UNKNOWN] so

297
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,640
I really like the way that you were
reasoning about that.

298
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,306
What would it be then?

299
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:21,480
How many pieces of lumber, how many
two-thirds of a foot sections could I get?

300
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,068
Leslie?

301
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,734
>> I think one and a half.

302
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:26,576
>> OK, and why do you think one and a
half?

303
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:32,500
>> I think [INAUDIBLE] I've got a foot of
lumber.

304
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,329
>> [INAUDIBLE] I should have said a
[INAUDIBLE] you

305
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:39,912
usually don't have lumber in one foot
sections, but anyway.

306
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,836
>> [INAUDIBLE] one third glass, and one
third packing paper.

307
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:48,240
>> Okay, so if I have a, here's my foot of
lumber right.

308
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,210
>> And I cut off my, I cut off my 2 3rds,
and so

309
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,980
I get rid of that and then I've only got
this little piece left, so

310
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,952
I've only got one, two, thirds of a foot
section, this one.

311
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,923
And then this part is how long?

312
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:07,965
>> [INAUDIBLE].

313
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:12,270
>> One third of a foot, and that's half of
what I made.

314
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,098
So one and a half is the correct answer.

315
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,724
Now, Christine, does that make any sense
to you?

316
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:22,096
>> Yeah, well it does make sense
[INAUDIBLE] five maybe less

317
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,724
[INAUDIBLE] thought it was too big, but
like I was like the,

318
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:30,684
I know the probability's confusing but
wouldn't it,

319
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:39,920
like, the foot of lumber, like, divided by
3, is 12 divided by 3 is 4.

320
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,264
>> Where are you getting 12?

321
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:42,720
>> Because twelve inches in a foot.

322
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,016
>> Oh, so you're thinking twelve inches in
a foot, yes?

323
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,752
And so each third would be four inches.

324
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:47,312
>> Four inches.

325
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,096
>> I agree with that.

326
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,505
And 2 3rds of a foot is how many inches?

327
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:51,228
>> 8 inches.

328
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:51,950
>> 8 inches.

329
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,340
So I cut out 8 inches and I've got how
many inches left?

330
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,840
>> 4.

331
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,340
>> 4, and 4 is half of 8.

332
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,440
So that's another way to prove it.

333
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,124
Okay.
Now,

334
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:04,512
I'd like you to copy this down [SOUND]
because this is

335
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:09,532
called a traditional algorithm for
dividing fractions.

336
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,727
>> [INAUDIBLE].

337
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:18,900
>> There's more than one way to divide
functions.

338
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,864
This is the traditional algorithm
[INAUDIBLE].
