1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,440
So teaching is really complex and

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,540
intellectual work, even though people
often don't think that.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,708
If you think about just for a moment what
happens when you're in a whole, when

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,684
a teacher's in a whole class discussion
and a student asks a question or

5
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:18,400
says something, and the teacher needs to
come back with a comment or question.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,770
In that moment, they have to hear what
their students have said.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,838
And make sense of that in terms of their
thinking, and

8
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:27,880
think about what their mathematical
trajectory is, what's helpful for them.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,277
At the same time, thinking about the
journey of the class, and

10
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:33,260
where they are and what they need to hear.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,963
And in that split second they have to make
those decisions and

12
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:39,560
come back with a question or a response
for a student.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,342
That is a very, very hard thing to do, and

14
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:44,600
teaching is one of the hardest jobs in the
world.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,410
It's also one of the most important.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,286
And what we now know is that small
moments, small conversations, and

17
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,822
messages to students can make a huge, huge
difference.

18
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:00,490
And I'm going to to come to those, some of
those in a moment.

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,018
But first, I want us to look together at
some data.

20
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:07,044
I want to share with you now some data
that I learned in this past year and I,

21
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,927
I was pretty shocked by.

22
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,590
And that's this.

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,302
Currently in the US, 50% of students are
in two-year colleges.

24
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:19,904
70% of those students are placed into
remedial maths courses.

25
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:23,210
Basically, repeating the maths they took
in high school.

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,330
And, only one in ten students complete
those courses.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,940
For the other 90%, they actually leave
college.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,617
That, they don't get through those maths
course and

29
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,500
that's the end of their college career.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,920
So that data is, I think, pretty shocking
and

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,935
it tells you about a widespread problem.

32
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,821
And I want you to think now about, what do
you think is the top reason for

33
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,890
that problem?

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,368
And I've just put four reasons down.

35
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,900
This I going to, to just choose one.

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,310
Or you can choose more than one from the
list.

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,767
So this is your first question that's
actually a multiple choice question,

38
00:01:55,767 --> 00:02:00,010
even though there aren't going to be many
multiple choice questions at all in here.

39
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,910
But this one works for that.

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,540
So I want you to just look at the choices.

41
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,940
Pick as many as you like.

42
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,298
Try and you know try and make it one or
two.

43
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:13,386
Why you think that there's such a terrible
problem in mathematics education that so

44
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:17,400
many students in their career with math.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,790
So is it the teaching methods that are
taught in schools and colleges?

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,790
Maybe you think students lack foundational
knowledge that trips them up.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,255
Maybe you think students don't have the
ability for that high level maths or

48
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:34,260
perhaps algebra is the stumbling block.

49
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,230
It's just a very difficult subject for
many.

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,890
So choose from those.
